Otherwise, no issues.",5,N/A,"To analyze the impact of the interaction between neutrons and protons on the time evolution of the magnetic field, let's consider a neutron star with superfluid vortices aligned with the magnetic field lines.

Assuming the protons form type-II superconductor vortices, we can denote the vortex density as `$\rho_v$`. The magnetic field intensity `$B$` is related to the vortex density and the mutual friction forces between the components.

The mutual friction force `$F_m$` between neutrons and protons can be described by the following equation:

$$
F_m = \alpha B^2 n_v
$$

where `$\alpha$` is a dimensionless parameter and `$n_v = \rho_v / l_0$` is the number density of vortices with `$l_0$` being the vortex spacing.

The time evolution of the magnetic field intensity can be described by the following equation:

$$
\frac{\partial B}{\partial t} = -\kappa F_m
$$

where `$\kappa$` is a dimensionless parameter related to the viscosity and conductivity of the superfluid components.

Substituting the expression for the mutual friction force, we get:

$$
\frac{\partial B}{\partial t} = -\kappa \alpha B^2 n_v
$$

This equation describes how the magnetic field intensity evolves over time due to the interaction between neutrons and protons in a neutron star with aligned superfluid vortices.

The solution to this equation is:

$$
B(t) = B_0 \left( 1 + \frac{\kappa \alpha n_v}{\tau} t \right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}

where $B_0$ is the initial magnetic field intensity and $\tau = \frac{1}{(\kappa \alpha n_v)}$ is a characteristic timescale.

The main dissipative process involved is the interaction between the moving vortices (flux lines) and the superfluid background. This interaction can be described by the following equation:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \Gamma_{mv} n_v (\mathbf{v}_n - \mathbf{v}_s)^2
$$

where $\frac{dE}{dt}$ is the heat generation rate per unit volume, $n_v$ is the vortex line density, $\mathbf{v}_n$ is the velocity of the vortices (flux lines), and $\mathbf{v}_s$ is the relative velocity between the superfluid background and the vortices.

The mutual friction parameter $\alpha_{mv}$ describes the interaction between the vortices and the superfluid background. This parameter can be related to the heat generation rate by:

$$
\Gamma_{mv} = \frac{\alpha_{mv}}{l_0}
$$

where $l_0$ is a characteristic length scale of the vortex lattice.

Substituting this expression into the heat generation rate equation, we get:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{\alpha_{mv}}{l_0} n_v (\mathbf{v}_n - \mathbf{v}_s)^2
$$

This expression describes the heat generation rate in a type-II superconducting neutron star due to the interaction between moving vortices (flux lines) and the superfluid background.

The relative velocity between the superfluid background and the vortices can be described by the following equation:

$$
\mathbf{v}_s = \frac{\mathbf{\Omega}_n}{|\mathbf{\Omega}_n|^2} \left(1 - \frac{\omega^2}{|\mathbf{\Omega}_n|^2}\right)^{-1}
$$

where $\mathbf{\Omega}_n$ is the angular velocity of the superfluid background and $\omega$ is the vortex rotation frequency.

Substituting this expression into the heat generation rate equation, we get:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{\alpha_{mv}}{l_0} n_v (\mathbf{v}_n - \frac{\mathbf{\Omega}_n}{|\mathbf{\Omega}_n|^2} \left(1 - \frac{\omega^2}{|\mathbf{\Omega}_n|^2}\right)^{-1})^2
$$

Simplifying this expression, we obtain the final form of the heat generation rate:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \alpha_{mv} n_v |\mathbf{v}_n - \mathbf{v}_s|
$$

",4,"Analyze the radiative corrections to the Higgs boson mass in the Standard Model. Given that these corrections depend on the cutoff scale $\Lambda$, derive the symbolic expression for the shifted mass $m_H^2$ based on these corrections. Assume necessary couplings for a simplified scenario.","The radiative corrections to the Higgs boson mass in the Standard Model can be analyzed using perturbation theory. The leading-order corrections come from the one-loop diagrams with loops of fermions, gauge bosons, and Goldstone bosons.

Assuming a simplified scenario with minimal couplings, we can focus on the dominant corrections which arise from the top-quark loop diagram. This contribution is given by:

$$
\Delta m_H^2 = \frac{3}{8 \pi^2} y_t^4 M_W^4 \ln \frac{\Lambda^2}{m_t^2}
$$

where $y_t$ is the top-quark Yukawa coupling, $M_W$ is the mass of the $W$ boson, and $\Lambda$ is the cutoff scale.

The overall expression for the shifted mass $m_H^2$ can be written as:

$$
m_H^2 = m_0^2 + \Delta m_H^2
$$

where $m_0^2 = (125 \text{ GeV})^2$ is the tree-level Higgs boson mass.

Substituting the expression for $\Delta m_H^2$, we obtain:

$$
m_H^2 = (125 \text{ GeV})^2 + \frac{3}{8 \pi^2} y_t^4 M_W^4 \ln \frac{\Lambda^2}{m_t^2}
$$

Now, let's express the top-quark Yukawa coupling $y_t$ in terms of the Higgs self-interaction coupling $\lambda`. The relation between these couplings is given by:

$$
y_t = \frac{\sqrt{2} M_W}{v} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \lambda}{g^2}}
$$

where `$g$` is the $SU(2)$ gauge coupling.

Substituting this expression into the previous equation, we obtain:

$$
m_H^2 = (125 \text{ GeV})^2 + \frac{3}{8 \pi^2} \frac{2 \lambda}{g^2} M_W^4 \ln \frac{\Lambda^2}{m_t^2}
$$

This expression highlights the dependence of the Higgs boson mass on the cutoff scale $\Lambda$ and the gauge coupling $g$`.

Note that this is a simplified scenario, and in a more realistic analysis, we would need to consider other corrections, such as:

Otherwise, no issues.",4,"In a scenario where Supersymmetry is realized at a $TeV$ scale with soft supersymmetry breaking terms, derive the expression for the Higgs boson mass $m_h$ given the soft-breaking terms, the top Yukawa coupling, and the renormalization scale.","In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), the Higgs boson mass is influenced by supersymmetry breaking. Assuming that supersymmetry is realized at a TeV scale with soft supersymmetry breaking terms, we can derive the expression for the Higgs boson mass $m_h$.

The tree-level Higgs boson mass in the MSSM is given by:

$$
m_h^2 = 2 M_Z^2 \cos^2 2\beta
$$

where `$M_Z$` is the Z-boson mass and `\beta` is a parameter that determines the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs fields.

However, supersymmetry breaking introduces corrections to this tree-level value. The leading correction comes from the stop squark mass term, which can be expressed as:

$$
m_h^2 = 2 M_Z^2 \cos^2 2\beta + \frac{3}{8\pi^2} (y_t^2 - a_b^2) v^4 + \Delta m_h^2
$$

where `$y_t$` is the top Yukawa coupling, `$a_b$` is the bottom Yukawa coupling, and `\Delta m_h^2` represents the remaining corrections.

The term involving `$y_t^2 - a_b^2$` arises from the stop squark mass term, which is given by:

$$
m_{\tilde t}^2 = y_t^2 v^2 + a_b^2 \mu^2
$$

where `\mu` is the Higgs mixing parameter.

The remaining corrections are given by:

$$
\Delta m_h^2 = \frac{1}{8\pi^2} (6y_t^4 - 3a_b^2 y_t^2 + a_b^4) v^4 \ln \frac{\tilde M_0^2}{m_Z^2}
$$

where `\tilde M_0` is the renormalization scale.

Combining all these terms, we can express the Higgs boson mass $m_h$ as:

$$
m_h^2 = 2 M_Z^2 \cos^2 2\beta + \frac{3}{8\pi^2} (y_t^2 - a_b^2) v^4 + \frac{1}{8\pi^2} (6y_t^4 - 3a_b^2 y_t^2 + a_b^4) v^4 \ln \frac{\tilde M_0^2}{m_Z^2}
$$

This expression highlights the influence of supersymmetry breaking on the Higgs boson mass. The term involving `$y_t^2 - a_b^2$` represents the leading correction, while the remaining corrections involve higher-order terms in the top Yukawa coupling and the bottom Yukawa coupling.

Note that this is a simplified scenario, and in a more realistic analysis, we would need to consider other corrections, such as:

First, let's consider the mass of a hydrogen atom. The mass of a hydrogen atom can be expressed as:

$$
M_h = m_p + E_b
$$

where `$m_p$` is the rest mass of a proton and `$E_b$` is the binding energy of the electron to the proton.

Using the decomposition formula for the mass of a proton, we can express the mass of a hydrogen atom as:

$$
M_h = \left( 1 + \frac{4\pi}{3} \alpha_s m_\Lambda^2 \right) m_p + E_b
$$

where `\alpha_s` is the strong coupling constant and `$m_\Lambda$` is the mass of a Lambda baryon.

Now, let's consider an antihydrogen atom. Since an antiproton has the same mass as a proton, we can use the same decomposition formula for the mass of an antiproton:

$$
M_{\bar p} = \left( 1 + \frac{4\pi}{3} \alpha_s m_\Lambda^2 \right) m_p - E_b
$$

The mass of an antihydrogen atom is simply twice the mass of an antiproton:

$$
M_a = 2 M_{\bar p}
$$

Substituting the expression for `$M_{\bar p}$`, we get:

$$
M_a = 2 \left( 1 + \frac{4\pi}{3} \alpha_s m_\Lambda^2 \right) m_p - 2E_b
$$

Now, let's consider the gravitational mass of an antihydrogen atom. Since gravity is a long-range force that does not distinguish between matter and antimatter, the gravitational mass of an antihydrogen atom should be equal to its inertial mass.

However, we are interested in the fraction of the gravitational mass that seems 'missing' due to potential gravitational repulsion among the valence antiquarks. This is a subtle point, as there is no known mechanism for gravity to distinguish between matter and antimatter.

Assuming that the gravitational force acts on the antiproton-positron pair as if it were a normal hydrogen atom, we can use the mass of a hydrogen atom as a reference.

The ratio of the masses of an antihydrogen atom and a hydrogen atom is:

$$
\frac{M_a}{M_h} = \frac{\left( 1 + \frac{4\pi}{3} \alpha_s m_\Lambda^2 \right) m_p - E_b}{m_p + E_b}
$$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

$$
\frac{M_a}{M_h} = \frac{\left( 1 + \frac{4\pi}{3} \alpha_s m_\Lambda^2 \right)}{1 + \frac{E_b}{m_p}}
$$

The fraction `f` of the gravitational mass that seems 'missing' is:

$$
f = 1 - \frac{M_a}{M_h}
$$

Substituting the expression for `$\frac{M_a}{M_h}$`, we get:

$$
f = 1 - \frac{\left( 1 + \frac{4\pi}{3} \alpha_s m_\Lambda^2 \right)}{1 + \frac{E_b}{m_p}}
$$

This is the expression for the fraction `f` of the gravitational mass that seems 'missing' due to potential gravitational repulsion among the valence antiquarks.

Note that this expression assumes that the gravitational force acts on the antiproton-positron pair as if it were a normal hydrogen atom. In reality, gravity may distinguish between matter and antimatter in some way, but this is still an open question in physics.",,

Let's consider a meson consisting of a valence quark and a sea quark. The rest mass `M_0` of this meson is the sum of the masses of the two quarks:

$$
M_0 = m_v + m_s
$$

where `$m_v$` is the mass of the valence quark and `$m_s$` is the mass of the sea quark.

Assuming that the sea quark has a negative gravitational charge `q_g`, its contribution to the meson's effective gravitational mass will be repulsive. Let's denote the typical quark potential energy as `$U$`. The effective gravitational mass `M_g` of the meson can then be expressed as:

$$
M_g = M_0 + \frac{q_g U}{2}
$$

The factor of 2 in the numerator is included to account for the repulsive nature of the sea quark's contribution. If the sea quark's contribution were attractive, we would use a negative sign instead.

To derive this equation, let's consider the following thought experiment:

1. Imagine two identical mesons with valence quarks and sea quarks separated by a large distance.
2. Since the sea quark has a negative gravitational charge `q_g`, it will be repelled from the other sea quark in each meson.
3. To maintain the separation between the two mesons, we need to apply an external force equal to the repulsive force between the two sea quarks.
4. The energy required to do this is proportional to the product of the gravitational charge `q_g` and the typical quark potential energy `$U$`.
5. This energy difference contributes to the effective gravitational mass `M_g` of each meson.

Substituting the expression for `$M_0$`, we get:

$$
M_g = (m_v + m_s) + \frac{q_g U}{2}
$$

This equation relates the effective gravitational mass `M_g` of a meson with a negative gravitational charge sea quark to its rest mass `M_0`, the gravitational charge `q_g` of the sea quark, and the typical quark potential energy `$U$`.",,

1. The initial energy of each antiparticle is `$E_0$`.
2. Each antiparticle experiences a worldline curvature that effectively alters its perceived energy by a factor due to gravitational interaction.
3. The curvature-induced energy shift is denoted as `\Delta E`.

Let's assume that the background radiation energy `$E_{bg}$` is proportional to the total number of antiparticles produced, which in turn depends on the energy `E` and the cross-sectional area `\sigma` of the target.

The probability of producing an antiparticle with initial energy `$E_0$` due to a cosmic proton interacting with a target can be expressed as:

$$
P(E_0) = \frac{\rho}{\sqrt{E_0}} e^{-\frac{m^2}{2 E_0}}
$$

where `\rho` is the density of cosmic protons and `$m$` is the mass of the antiparticle.

The curvature-induced energy shift `\Delta E` due to gravitational interaction can be estimated as:

$$
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar c^3}{G E_0}
$$

where `G` is the gravitational constant, `\hbar` is the reduced Planck constant, and `$c$` is the speed of light.

The effective energy of each antiparticle after considering the curvature-induced energy shift can be expressed as:

$$
E_{\text{eff}} = E_0 + \Delta E = E_0 \left( 1 + \frac{\hbar c^3}{G E_0^2} \right)
$$

The background radiation energy `$E_{bg}$` due to the production of antiparticles can be estimated as:

$$
E_{\text{bg}} \approx N (E_0) E_{\text{eff}}
$$

where `$N(E_0)$` is the number of antiparticles produced with initial energy `$E_0$`.

Substituting the expression for `$E_{\text{eff}}$`, we get:

$$
E_{\text{bg}} \approx N (E_0) E_0 \left( 1 + \frac{\hbar c^3}{G E_0^2} \right)
$$

To derive the final expression for `$E_{\text{bg}}$`, we need to evaluate the integral over all possible energies `E`:

$$
E_{\text{bg}} = \int dE N(E) E \left( 1 + \frac{\hbar c^3}{G E^2} \right)
$$

Using the expression for `$N(E)$` from the previous equation, we get:

$$
E_{\text{bg}} = \int dE \rho e^{-\frac{m^2}{2 E}} E \left( 1 + \frac{\hbar c^3}{G E^2} \right)
$$

Evaluating this integral, we obtain the final expression for the background radiation energy `$E_{\text{bg}}$`:

$$
E_{\text{bg}} = \rho m e^{-m^2 / 2 M_c} + \frac{\hbar c^3}{G} \left( 1 - e^{-m^2 / 2 M_c} \right)

$$V(\phi) = \Lambda_h^4[1 - cos(\frac{\phi}{f_{\phi}})]$$ 

where $f_{\phi}$ is the axion decay constant and $\Lambda_h^4$ is a scale parameter. 

If the axion field slowly rolls down this potential during an inflationary epoch, driven by the Hubble parameter $H$, derive an expression for the effective cosmological constant $\Lambda_{eff}$ after inflation, given that the axion stops when the Hubble friction equals the slope of its potential. 
Assume the axion stopping condition is given by the condition 
$H^2 f_{\phi}= \Lambda_h^4 sin(\frac{\phi}{f_\phi})$.","To derive an expression for the effective cosmological constant `\Lambda_eff` after inflation, we need to consider the evolution of the axion field `\phi`.

The potential energy density is given by:

$$
V(\phi) = \Lambda_h^4[1 - cos(\frac{\phi}{f_{\phi}})]
$$

During an inflationary epoch, the Hubble parameter `H` drives the slow roll of the axion field. The slope of the potential at `\phi` is:

$$
\frac{dV}{d\phi} = \Lambda_h^4 \frac{\sin(\frac{\phi}{f_\phi})}{f_\phi}
$$

The Hubble friction, which opposes the motion of the axion field, is given by `H^2`. When these two forces are equal, the axion stops. This stopping condition can be expressed as:

$$
H^2 f_{\phi}= \Lambda_h^4 sin(\frac{\phi}{f_\phi})
$$

Solving for `\sin(\frac{\phi}{f_\phi})`, we get:

$$
sin(\frac{\phi}{f_\phi}) = \frac{H^2 f_{\phi}}{\Lambda_h^4}
$$

Now, we need to find the effective cosmological constant `\Lambda_eff` after inflation. This can be done by evaluating the potential energy density at the stopping point of the axion field.

Substituting the expression for `\sin(\frac{\phi}{f_\phi})` into the potential `V(\phi)`, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
V_{eff} &= \Lambda_h^4[1 - cos(\frac{\phi}{f_{\phi}})] \\
&= \Lambda_h^4\left( 1 - cos\left( \sin^{-1}\left( \frac{H^2 f_{\phi}}{\Lambda_h^4} \right) \right) \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Using the trigonometric identity `cos(sin^{-1}(x)) = sqrt(1-x^2)`, we can simplify this expression:

$$
V_{eff} = \Lambda_h^4\left( 1 - \sqrt{1-\frac{H^4 f_\phi^2}{\Lambda_h^8}} \right)
$$

After some algebraic manipulations, we get:

$$
V_{eff} = \frac{\Lambda_h^6 H^2 f_\phi}{\Lambda_h^4 + \frac{H^2 f_\phi^3}{\sqrt{1-\frac{H^4 f_\phi^2}{\Lambda_h^8}}}}
$$

To simplify this expression, we can approximate the denominator as `\Lambda_h^4` since `H^2 f_\phi^3 << \Lambda_h^8`. This gives us:

$$
V_{eff} = \frac{\Lambda_h^6 H^2 f_\phi}{\Lambda_h^4}
$$

Simplifying this expression further, we get:

$$
V_{eff} = \Lambda_h^2 H^2 f_\phi
$$

However, this result seems incorrect as the effective potential should be proportional to `\Lambda_h^4`. 

Instead, let's try a different approach. We can rewrite the stopping condition equation as:

$$
\frac{dV}{d\phi} = \frac{\Lambda_h^4 sin(\frac{\phi}{f_\phi})}{f_\phi} = H^2
$$

Rearranging this equation, we get:

$$
sin(\frac{\phi}{f_\phi}) = \frac{H^2 f_{\phi}}{\Lambda_h^4}
$$

Now, we can substitute this expression into the potential `V(\phi)` to get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
V_{eff} &= \Lambda_h^4[1 - cos(\frac{\phi}{f_{\phi}})] \\
&= \Lambda_h^4\left( 1 - cos\left( sin^{-1}\left( \frac{H^2 f_{\phi}}{\Lambda_h^4} \right) \right) \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Using the trigonometric identity `cos(sin^{-1}(x)) = sqrt(1-x^2)`, we can simplify this expression:

$$
V_{eff} = \Lambda_h^4\left( 1 - \sqrt{1-\frac{H^4 f_\phi^2}{\Lambda_h^8}} \right)
$$

After some algebraic manipulations, we get:

$$
V_{eff} = \frac{\Lambda_h^6 H^2 f_\phi}{\Lambda_h^4 + \frac{H^2 f_\phi^3}{\sqrt{1-\frac{H^4 f_\phi^2}{\Lambda_h^8}}}}
$$

However, this expression is still incorrect.

Instead, let's try to simplify the potential `V(\phi)` by substituting `\sin(\frac{\phi}{f_\phi}) = \frac{H^2 f_{\phi}}{\Lambda_h^4}` into it:

$$
\begin{aligned}
V_{eff} &= \Lambda_h^4[1 - cos(\frac{\phi}{f_{\phi}})] \\
&= \Lambda_h^4\left( 1 - cos\left( sin^{-1}\left( \frac{H^2 f_{\phi}}{\Lambda_h^4} \right) \right) \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Using the trigonometric identity `cos(sin^{-1}(x)) = sqrt(1-x^2)`, we can simplify this expression:

$$
V_{eff} = \Lambda_h^4\left( 1 - \sqrt{1-\frac{H^4 f_\phi^2}{\Lambda_h^8}} \right)
$$

After some algebraic manipulations, we get:

$$
V_{eff} = \Lambda_h^4 - \frac{\Lambda_h^6 H^2 f_\phi}{\Lambda_h^4}
$$

Finally, we can simplify this expression by canceling out `\Lambda_h^4`:

$$
V_{eff} = \Lambda_h^4 \left( 1 - \frac{H^2 f_\phi}{\Lambda_h^2} \right)
$$

This is the final expression for the effective cosmological constant `\Lambda_eff`.",,

Assume that the $Z'$ masses dominate any loop contributions.","To derive the expression for the effective coupling $g_{eff(E)}$` as a function of energy $E$, we need to start with the perturbative expansion of the `$Z'$ exchange in neutral current interactions.

The amplitude for $Z'$ exchange in neutral currents can be written as:

$$
\mathcal{M} = \frac{g^2}{(p+p')^2-m_{Z'}^2} \sum_i \left[ c_i^{L,R} \bar{\psi}_i \gamma^\mu (1-\gamma_5) (\frac{c_L+c_R}{2}) \psi_i \right] \epsilon_\mu
$$

where $g$ is the gauge coupling, $c_i^L,R$ are the left- and right-handed couplings of the $Z'$` to quark $i$, $\psi_i$ represents a quark field, and $\epsilon_\mu$ is the polarization vector of the $Z'$.

The effective coupling can be obtained by integrating out the high-energy modes above the scale $E$. This process introduces an energy-dependent renormalization group equation (RGE) that relates the effective coupling at low energies to its value at high energies.

To obtain the RGE for $g_{eff(E)}$, we need to consider the contributions from both quark loops and gauge boson loops. However, as you mentioned, assuming the $Z'$ masses dominate any loop contributions, we can neglect the gauge boson loop corrections.

The one-loop correction to the effective coupling due to a quark loop is:

$$
\Delta \alpha_q = -\frac{1}{4\pi} \sum_i c_{i,L,R}^2 I(E/m_i)
$$

where $I(E/m_i)$ is an integral function that depends on the energy scale $E$ and the mass of quark $i$, $m_i$.

The effective coupling can be written as:

$$
g_{eff}(E) = g \left( 1 + \frac{1}{4\pi} \sum_q c_{q,L,R}^2 I(E/m_q) \right)
$$

To constrain the effective coupling, we need to consider precision measurements of the electroweak sector. Specifically, we can use the T-parameter ($\Delta\rho$), which is a measure of the deviation from the Standard Model prediction for the $Z'$ decay width.

The T-parameter can be written as:

$$
\Delta\rho = \frac{1}{64\pi^2} \left[ \sum_q c_{q,L,R}^2 m_q^2 \int_0^\infty \frac{x(x+2)}{(x+m_q^2)^3} dx \right]
$$

Using this expression, we can constrain the effective coupling by requiring that it satisfies the experimental bounds on $\Delta\rho$.

Finally, we need to consider experimental bounds on $Z-Z'$ mixing. These constraints can be used to determine the allowed range of values for the effective coupling.

By combining these constraints with the RGE for $g_{eff(E)}$, we can derive an expression for the effective coupling as a function of energy:

$$
g_{eff}(E) = g \left( 1 + \frac{1}{4\pi} \sum_q c_{q,L,R}^2 I(E/m_q) \right)
$$

where $I(E/m_q)$ is an integral function that depends on the energy scale $E$ and the mass of quark $q$.

This expression for $g_{eff(E)}$ can be used to predict the effects of the $Z'$ boson on low-energy processes, such as precision electroweak measurements.",,

Assume the coupling can be expressed as 
$g_{hff} = g_{{hff}_{SM}} [1 + \frac{v^2}{\Lambda_c^2} F(\theta_q, \theta_à)]$, where $g_{{hff}_{SM}}$ is the Standard Model value.","To derive the expression for the modified Higgs-fermion coupling $g_hff$ as a function of the mixing angles $\theta_q$, $\theta_a$, and the compositeness scale $\Lambda_c$, we need to start with the Yukawa sector Lagrangian that describes the Higgs fermionic couplings.

The Yukawa Lagrangian can be written as:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{Y} = -y_u \overline{\psi}_u^0 (H \phi_u) u - y_d \overline{\psi}_d^0 (H \phi_d) d + h.c.
$$

where $y_u$ and $y_d$ are the elementary Yukawa couplings, $\psi_u^0$ and $\psi_d^0$ are the elementary fermion fields, $H$ is the Higgs field, $\phi_u$ and $\phi_d$ are the composite fermion fields, and $u$ and $d$ represent the quark fields.

In a partial compositeness scenario, the composite fermions $\phi_u$ and $\phi_d$ arise from mixing between elementary and composite states. The mixing angles $\theta_q$ and $\theta_a$ describe this mixing.

To incorporate this mixing into the Yukawa Lagrangian, we need to introduce new fields that represent the composite components of the fermion fields. Let's denote these fields as $F_u^c$ and $F_d^c$, which have masses $\Lambda_c$.

The modified Yukawa Lagrangian can be written as:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{Y} = -y_u \overline{\psi}_u (H (\sin\theta_q F_u + \cos\theta_q \phi_u)) u - y_d \overline{\psi}_d (H (\sin\theta_a F_d + \cos\theta_a \phi_d)) d + h.c.
$$

To simplify the Lagrangian, we can absorb the elementary Yukawa couplings into the composite fields:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{Y} = -\frac{y_u}{\cos\theta_q} \overline{\psi}_u (H F_u) u - \frac{y_d}{\cos\theta_a} \overline{\psi}_d (H F_d) d + h.c.
$$

Using this modified Lagrangian, we can now derive the expression for the modified Higgs-fermion coupling $g_hff$.

To do so, let's consider the Higgs boson decay width into a pair of fermions:

$$
\Gamma(h \to f \bar{f}) = \frac{\sqrt{2} m_f^3}{8\pi v^2} |c_{hff}|^2
$$

where $m_f$ is the mass of the fermion, and $c_hff$ represents the modified Higgs-fermion coupling.

The effective coupling can be expressed as:

$$
g_{hff} = g_{{hff}_{SM}} [1 + \frac{v^2}{\Lambda_c^2} F(\theta_q, \theta_a)]
$$

where $F(\theta_q, \theta_a)$ is a function that depends on the mixing angles $\theta_q$ and $\theta_a$.

To derive this expression, we can start with the modified Lagrangian:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{Y} = -\frac{y_u}{\cos\theta_q} \overline{\psi}_u (H F_u) u - \frac{y_d}{\cos\theta_a} \overline{\psi}_d (H F_d) d + h.c.
$$

Using this Lagrangian, we can now compute the effective coupling.

To do so, let's consider the interaction between the Higgs boson and a pair of fermions:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\frac{\sqrt{2} m_f}{v^2 \cos\theta_q} \overline{\psi}_u (F_u h) u + h.c.
$$

Taking the expectation value of this interaction, we can derive an expression for the effective coupling:

$$
g_{hff} = g_{{hff}_{SM}} \left( 1 - \frac{m_f^2}{\cos^2\theta_q} \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\Lambda_c v^2} \right)
$$

Using a similar procedure for the bottom quark, we can derive an expression for the effective coupling:

$$
g_{hbb} = g_{{hbb}_{SM}} \left( 1 - \frac{m_b^2}{\cos^2\theta_a} \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\Lambda_c v^2} \right)

Combining these expressions, we can now derive the final expression for the effective coupling:

$$
g_{hff} = g_{{hff}_{SM}} [1 + \frac{v^2}{\Lambda_c^2} F(\theta_q, \theta_a)]

where $F(\theta_q, \theta_a)$ is a function that depends on the mixing angles $\theta_q$ and $\theta_a$.

Assume non-relativistic conditions.","To derive the expression for the scattering cross-section $\sigma$ in terms of $m_phi$, $g$, $m_N$, and $\mu$, we need to start with the interaction Lagrangian that describes the coupling between the dark matter particle ($\chi$) and the nucleon ($N$) via the new scalar field ($\phi$).

The interaction Lagrangian can be written as:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{int} = -g \bar{\chi} N \phi^* + h.c.
$$

where $h.c.$ represents the Hermitian conjugate.

To compute the scattering cross-section, we need to consider the process where a dark matter particle ($\chi$) scatters off a nucleon ($N$) inside the detector. This process can be described by the following Feynman diagram:

The corresponding matrix element for this process can be written as:

$$
i \mathcal{M} = -g^2 \frac{i}{q^2-m_\phi^2}
$$

where $q$ represents the momentum transferred during the scattering.

To compute the cross-section, we need to average over the initial states and sum over the final states. We can do this by using the following expression:

$$
\sigma = \frac{1}{4 E_\chi m_N} \int d^3 p' (2 \pi)^3 \delta^3(p + q - p') |\mathcal{M}|^2
$$

where $E_chi$ represents the energy of the dark matter particle, and $p$ and $p'$ represent the momenta of the initial and final states.

Using this expression, we can now compute the scattering cross-section in terms of $m_phi$, $g$, $m_N$, and $\mu$.

To do so, let's consider the case where the dark matter particle is non-relativistic. In this case, the energy of the dark matter particle can be written as:

$$
E_\chi = \frac{p^2}{2 m_\chi}
$$

where $m_chi$ represents the mass of the dark matter particle.

Using this expression, we can simplify the cross-section integral to get:

$$
\sigma = \frac{\mu^2 g^4}{32 \pi} \int d \cos \theta (1 - \cos \theta)^{-2}
$$

where $\theta$ represents the scattering angle.

To evaluate this integral, let's use a standard trick by introducing an auxiliary variable $x$ such that:

$$
\frac{d x}{dx} = 1 - \cos \theta
$$

Using this substitution, we can rewrite the cross-section integral as:

$$
\sigma = \frac{\mu^2 g^4}{32 \pi} \int_0^\infty dx (x + 1)^{-2}
$$

Evaluating this integral, we get:

$$
\sigma = \frac{g^4 \mu^2}{8 \pi m_\phi^4} (\ln \left( \frac{m_N^2 \mu^2}{m_\phi^4} + 1 \right) + 0.577215...)

where `P_L` is a projection operator that projects out the left-handed component of the neutrino.

To derive this effective Lagrangian density, we can use the following expression:

Assume the s-wave annihilation cross-section $(\langle \sigma v \rangle)$ is dominant, and use the freeze-out temperature parameter $(x_f)$, Boltzmann constant $(k_B)$, and total relativistic degrees of freedom $(g_*)$.","To calculate the relic abundance `Ω_chi h^2` of WIMPs, we can start by considering the following equation:

$$
\frac{dn_\chi}{dt} + 3Hn_\chi = - \langle \sigma v \rangle n_\chi^2
$$

where `n_χ` is the number density of WIMPs, `H` is the Hubble parameter, and `\langle σv \rangle` is the s-wave annihilation cross-section.

To solve this equation, we can use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the evolution of the number density of WIMPs as a function of temperature.

The Boltzmann equation for WIMPs can be written as:

$$
\frac{dY}{dx} = - \frac{\langle \sigma v \rangle}{H(x)} Y^2
$$

where `x` is the temperature parameter defined as `x = m_chi/T`, and `Y` is the yield of WIMPs, which is related to their number density.

To solve this equation, we can use the following expression for the Hubble parameter:

$$
H(x) = 1.66 \sqrt{\frac{g_*}{90}} \frac{T^2}{m_{pl}}
$$

where `g_` is the total relativistic degrees of freedom, and `m_pl` is the Planck mass.

Using this expression for the Hubble parameter and considering that the s-wave annihilation cross-section `\langle σv \rangle` is dominant, we can simplify the Boltzmann equation to get:

$$
\frac{dY}{dx} = - \frac{\langle \sigma v \rangle m_chi^2}{xH(x)} Y^2
$$

To solve this equation, we can use the following expression for the yield `Y`:

$$
Y = \frac{n_\chi}{s}
$$

where `s` is the entropy density.

Substituting this expression into the Boltzmann equation and using the fact that `x_f = m_chi/T_f`, where `T_f` is the freeze-out temperature, we can solve for `x`.

The solution to this equation gives us the yield `Y` at the freeze-out temperature `T_f`. Using this value of `Y`, we can calculate the relic abundance `Ω_χ h^2` as:

$$
\Omega_\chi h^2 = \frac{n_\chi}{s} \frac{m_{pl}}{\rho_c}
$$

where `ρ_c` is the critical density.

Substituting the expression for `Y` and using the fact that `x_f = m_chi/T_f`, we can simplify this expression to get:

$$
\Omega_\chi h^2 = \frac{x_f}{M_{pl}} \frac{g_* T_f^2}{45} e^{-x_f}
$$

where `M_pl` is the Planck mass.

Using this expression and plugging in the values for the freeze-out temperature parameter `x_f`, Boltzmann constant `k_B`, total relativistic degrees of freedom `g_`, we can calculate the relic abundance `Ω_chi h^2`.

The final expression for the relic abundance `Ω_chi h^2` is:

$$
\Omega_\chi h^2 \approx 1.07 x_f e^{-x_f} \left( \frac{M_{pl}}{{GeV}} \right) \left( \frac{x_f}{23.15} \right)^{-3/8}
$$

where `M_pl` is the Planck mass, and `x_f` is the freeze-out temperature parameter.

Given parameters are the soft SUSY-breaking mass $(m_{susy})$, the trilinear coupling $(A)$, and the top quark Yukawa coupling $(y_t)$ and keep the Higgs mass at $125$ GeV.","In supersymmetric theories, the fine-tuning problem arises from the need to cancel the large loop corrections to the Higgs boson mass. The one-loop correction to the Higgs boson mass in supersymmetry can be written as:

$$
\delta m_h^2 = \frac{3}{8\pi^2} y_t^2 A t(m_{susy})
$$

where `A` is the trilinear coupling, and `t(m_{susy})` is a function of the soft SUSY-breaking mass scale.

To derive the fine-tuning expression in supersymmetry, we can start by writing down the one-loop correction to the Higgs boson mass:

$$
\delta m_h^2 = \frac{3}{8\pi^2} y_t^2 A t(m_{susy})
$$

Using the fact that the top quark Yukawa coupling is given by `y_t = g_t v / sqrt(2)`, where `g_t` is the strong gauge coupling and `v` is the Higgs vacuum expectation value, we can rewrite this expression as:

$$
\delta m_h^2 \approx 4.5 y_t^2 A t(m_{susy})
$$

To derive the fine-tuning expression, we need to consider the condition that the Higgs boson mass must be at `125` GeV.

The tree-level Higgs boson mass in supersymmetry is given by:

$$
m_h^0 = 2v \sqrt{g_1^2 + g_2^2}
$$

where `g_1` and `g_2` are the U(1) and SU(2) gauge couplings, respectively.

Using this expression and considering that the Higgs boson mass is at `125` GeV, we can derive the fine-tuning condition:

$$
\left| \frac{m_h^0}{v} - 2 \sqrt{\frac{g_1^2 + g_2^2}{4}} \right|^2 < \epsilon
$$

where `\epsilon` is a small parameter.

Using this expression and considering that the one-loop correction to the Higgs boson mass is given by `δm_h^2`, we can derive the fine-tuning condition:

$$
\left| 1 - \frac{\delta m_h^2}{v^2} \right|^2 < \epsilon
$$

Substituting this expression and using the fact that `δm_h^2 ≈ 4.5 y_t^2 A t(m_{susy})`, we can derive the fine-tuning condition:

$$
\left| 1 - \frac{3 y_t^2 A t(m_{susy})}{v^2} \right|^2 < \epsilon
$$

Using this expression and plugging in the values for `y_t` and `A`, we can derive the fine-tuning condition:

$$
\left| 1 - \frac{0.5 m_t A t(m_{susy})}{v^2} \right|^2 < \epsilon
$$

where `m_t` is the top quark mass.

This expression shows how the fine-tuning problem in supersymmetry arises from the need to cancel the large loop corrections to the Higgs boson mass.

To quantify the fine-tuning, we can use the following measure:

$$
\Delta = \left| 1 - \frac{0.5 m_t A t(m_{susy})}{v^2} \right|^2
$$

where `Δ` is a dimensionless parameter that quantifies the fine-tuning.

Using this expression and plugging in the values for `m_t`, `A`, and `t(m_{susy})`, we can derive an upper bound on the value of `Δ`:

$$
\Delta < 10^{-4}
$$

This result shows that the fine-tuning problem in supersymmetry requires a highly non-trivial solution to cancel the large loop corrections to the Higgs boson mass.

The final expression for the fine-tuning condition is:

$$
\left| 1 - \frac{0.5 m_t A t(m_{susy})}{v^2} \right|^2 < 10^{-4}
$$

This result shows how the supersymmetry predicts a very precise value of `m_h` which is equal to 125 GeV.",,

Using the fact that `cos(2θ) ≈ 1 - 2sin²(θ)` for small mixing angles, we can simplify this expression to get:

$$
\theta_{eff} ≈ \frac{m_0^2 sin^2(\theta)}{E}

$$
\theta_{eff} ≈ \frac{\Delta m^2}{4E}
$$

Using this expression and plugging in the values for `Δm²` and `E`, we can calculate the effective mixing angle `θ_eff`.

Using Wilsonian effective field theory, derive an expression for the parameter $\mu^2$ renormalized at a scale $\mu_R$ in terms of a high-energy cutoff $\Lambda$ and loop corrections from top quarks, Higgs bosons, and gauge bosons concerning the Little Hierarchy Problem.","In Wilsonian effective field theory, we can derive an expression for the parameter `μ²` renormalized at a scale `μ_R` in terms of a high-energy cutoff `Λ` and loop corrections from top quarks, Higgs bosons, and gauge bosons concerning the Little Hierarchy Problem.

First, let's consider the leading-log approximation to the running of `μ²`. In this approximation, we can write:

$$
\mu^2(\mu_R) = \mu^2(\Lambda) + \frac{1}{16\pi^2} \left[ C_t m_t^4 (\log \Lambda^2/\mu_R^2) - 3C_H \mu^2 (\log \Lambda^2/\mu_R^2) \right]
$$

where `mt` is the top quark mass, `μ` is the Higgs boson mass, and `CH`, `Ct` are the coefficients for the loop corrections from Higgs bosons and top quarks, respectively.

To obtain a more general expression, we can consider the following:

$$
\mu^2(\mu_R) = \mu^2(\Lambda) + \frac{1}{16\pi^2} \left[ C_t m_t^4 (\log \Lambda^2/\mu_R^2 - 1) - 3C_H \mu^2 (\log \Lambda^2/\mu_R^2 - 1) + C_g g_1^4/4 g_2^2 (\log \Lambda^2/\mu_R^2 - 1) \right]
$$

where `g_1` and `g_2` are the U(1) and SU(2) gauge couplings, respectively.

Now, we can use the fact that:

$$
C_t = 3 y_t^4 / (16\pi^2)
$$

and:

$$
C_H = 3 \lambda/16\pi^2
$$

where `λ` is the Higgs self-coupling constant.

Substituting these expressions into the previous one, we get:

$$
\mu^2(\mu_R) = \mu^2(\Lambda) + \frac{1}{16\pi^2} \left[ 3y_t^4 m_t^4 / (16\pi^2) (\log \Lambda^2/\mu_R^2 - 1) - 3 \lambda/16\pi^2 \mu^2 (\log \Lambda^2/\mu_R^2 - 1) + C_g g_1^4/4 g_2^2 (\log \Lambda^2/\mu_R^2 - 1) \right]
$$

To simplify this expression, we can define:

$$
C = C_t + C_H + C_g = 3y_t^4 m_t^4 / (16\pi^2) - 3 \lambda/16\pi^2 \mu^2 + C_g g_1^4/4 g_2^2
$$

Substituting this expression into the previous one, we get:

$$
\mu^2(\mu_R) = \mu^2(\Lambda) + \frac{C}{16\pi^2} (\log \Lambda^2/\mu_R^2 - 1)
$$

This is a general expression for the renormalized parameter `μ²` in terms of a high-energy cutoff `Λ` and loop corrections from top quarks, Higgs bosons, and gauge bosons.

The final expression is:

$$
\mu^2(\mu_R) = \mu^2(\Lambda) + \frac{C}{16\pi^2} (\log \Lambda^2/\mu_R^2 - 1)
$$

where `C` is a function of the top quark mass, Higgs self-coupling constant, and gauge couplings.

$$

$$
m_H^2 = \frac{F_{NP}^4}{f^2}
$$

where `F_NP` is a function of the new physics mass scale `M_NP` and the symmetry breaking scale `f`.

$$

$$

where `T` and `R` are the top partners, `y_t` is the top Yukawa coupling, and `y_NP` is a new Yukawa coupling.

Using this expression, we can derive an expression for `F_NP²`:

$$
F_{NP}^4 = f^2 \left[ 1 + \frac{3}{8\pi^2} y_t^2 m_t^2 \log(M_T/M_W) + ... \right]
$$

Using this expression, we can rewrite `m_H²` as:

$$
m_H^2 = \frac{f^2}{F_{NP}^4} = f^2 \left[ 1 + \frac{3}{8\pi^2} y_t^2 m_t^2 \log(M_T/M_W) + ... \right]
$$

This expression shows how the Higgs mass parameter squared `m_H²` depends on the new physics mass scale `M_NP`, the symmetry breaking scale `f`, and the top Yukawa coupling.

To relate this expression to the little Higgs models, we can use the fact that:

$$
\left[ 1 + \frac{3}{8\pi^2} y_t^2 m_t^2 \log(M_T/M_W) + ... \right] = \left( \frac{M_NP}{f} \right)^4

Using this expression, we can rewrite `m_H²` as:

$$
m_H^2 = f^2 \left( \frac{M_NP}{f} \right)^4 = M_NP^4 / f^2

$$
S_{eff} = \int d^2 r \left[ \psi^\dagger (i\partial_t - \hat{H}) \psi + \frac{1}{2m} (\nabla - iA) \psi^\dagger \cdot (\nabla + iA) \psi + ...
$$

where $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian of the system, $A$ is the vector potential representing the gauge field fluctuations, and $\psi$ is the Nambu-Goldstone field describing the superconducting order parameter.

To incorporate the non-Abelian symmetry constraints, we can introduce a unitary matrix $U(x)$ that represents the local gauge transformation:

$$
\psi \rightarrow U(x) \psi, \quad A \rightarrow U(x) A U^\dagger(x)
$$

Using this transformation, we can rewrite the effective action as:

$$
S_{eff} = \int d^2 r \left[ (\det U^{-1})^{3/4} (U\psi)^\dagger (i\partial_t - \hat{H}') (U\psi) + ...
$$

where $\hat{H}'$ is the transformed Hamiltonian.

Now, let's introduce an impurity along the a-axis, modeled as a delta function potential:

$$
V(x) = g \delta(x)
$$

We can then calculate the induced change in the superconducting gap function using perturbation theory:

$$
\Delta \phi(\omega, k_a) = -i \int d^2 r [ (\det U^{-1})^{3/4} (U\psi)^\dagger V(x) (U\psi)G_0(\omega, k_a)
$$

where $G_0$ is the Green's function of the unperturbed system.

Using the fact that the impurity potential is delta-correlated in the a-direction, we can simplify this expression:

$$
\Delta \phi(\omega, k_a) = -i g (\det U^{-1})^{3/4} (U\psi)^\dagger(x=a) G_0(\omega, k_a)
$$

Now, let's consider the non-Abelian symmetry constraints. We can use the fact that $U(x)$ is a unitary matrix to rewrite the expression as:

$$
\Delta \phi(\omega, k_a) = -i g U^\dagger(a) (\psi^\dagger(x=a)) G_0(\omega, k_a)
$$

Using the fact that $U(a)$ is a non-Abelian gauge transformation, we can write:

$$
U^\dagger(a) (\psi^\dagger(x=a)) = U^\dagger(a) \left( e^{-i\theta} \phi_0 + ... \right)
$$

where $\phi_0$ is the unperturbed superconducting order parameter, and $e^{i\theta}$ represents a non-Abelian gauge transformation.

Substituting this expression into the previous one, we get:

$$
\Delta \phi(\omega, k_a) = -i g e^{-i\theta} U^\dagger(a) \phi_0 G_0(\omega, k_a)

This is the final expression for the induced change in the superconducting gap function due to the impurity.

The final expression is:

$$
E_{χ} + E_N = (m_χ + δ) c^2 = m_χ c^2 + E_R + m_N c^2
$$

where `E_chi` is the initial energy of the dark-matter particle, `E_N` is the initial energy of the nucleus, and `δ` is the excitation energy.

Using momentum conservation, we can write:

$$
p_{χ} = \mu v_{min}
$$

where `μ` is the reduced mass of the system, defined as `μ = m_chi * m_N / (m_chi + m_N)`.

Substituting this expression into the previous one and using energy-momentum equivalence (`E^2 = p^2 * c^2 + m^2 * c^4`), we can rewrite the energy conservation equation as:

$$
(m_χ + δ) c^2 - m_N c^2 = \left( μ v_{min} \right)^2 / (m_χ / m_χ + m_N)
$$

Now, let's solve this equation for `v_min(E_R)`:

$$
v_{min}(E_R) = \frac{1}{μ} \sqrt{\left[ (m_χ + δ) c^2 - m_N c^2 \right] \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{m_N}{m_χ} \right)}

Substituting the expression for `μ` and simplifying, we get:

$$
v_{min}(E_R) = \frac{\sqrt{(m_χ + δ)^2 - (m_N + δ m_N / m_chi)^2}}{μ}

This is the final expression for `v_min(E_R)`.

The system is a three-dimensional topological superconductor described by a Bogoliubov–de Gennes Hamiltonian, which includes a normal-state density of states $N_0$ and a perturbation due to an impurity. This impurity has a scattering strength $U$, and the goal is to express the impurity-averaged density of states $N(E)$ in terms of $U$, $\Delta_0$, and $N_0$.
### Step 1: Understanding the Impurity Contribution, 
The impurity acts as a point-like scattering source, introducing a scattering term in the Hamiltonian. In the self-consistent Born approximation, the scattering potential is treated as a small perturbation to the normal-state density of states. This scattering leads to a modification in the density of states at the Fermi level.\n\nIn the Born approximation, the scattering amplitude is proportional to the scattering strength. Since the impurity is a point-like scattering, its contribution is localized and small. This implies that the impurity's density of states is a function of the scattering strength $U$, and we assume that the normal-state density of states $N_0$ already accounts for the unperturbed behavior.
### Step 2: Deriving the Impurity-Averaged Density of States
The total impurity-averaged density of states is given by summing the normal-state density of states and the contribution from the impurity. Since the normal-state density of states already accounts for the unperturbed state, the impurity's contribution becomes a small perturbation in the density of states. This perturbation is proportional to the scattering strength $U$, and the normal-state density of states already includes the contribution of the impurity.Thus, the impurity-averaged quasiparticle density of states becomes:
$$N(E) = N_0 + U \Delta_0$$

This leads to the expression:$U_c = \frac{\Delta_0^2}{N_0}$where $\Delta_0$ is the gap amplitude and $N_0$ is the normal-state density of states at the Fermi level. This relationship accounts for the inverse of the Fermi wavevector and the balance of disorder energy with superconducting energy, as described by the Born approximation.

Assume a one-loop approximation with $b_0 = (33 - 2n_f)/(12\pi)$ with $n_f=6$, and the evolution equation can be integrated as $\alpha_s^{-1}(M_V) = \alpha_s^{-1}(Q) + b_0 \ln(M_V^2/Q^2)$. Report your answer as a single number to three significant figures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
