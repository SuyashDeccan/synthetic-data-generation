We're dealing with a system of discrete masses with a nonlinear spring system, a differential equation, and a decaying coupling strength.  The goal is to find the value of $u_0$ which represents the initial displacement of the first mass.

**1. Understanding the Problem and Assumptions**

*   **Discrete Mass System:** We have an infinite collection of masses $u_i$ where $i \in \mathbb{Z}$.
*   **Spring Model:** The displacements $u_i$ are generated by springs. The restoring force depends on the displacement of neighboring masses, as described by the differential equation.
*   **Coupling Strength:**  The $J_{ij}$ are decaying rapidly as $|i-j|$ increases, meaning $J_{ij} \approx \frac{1}{(1 + (i-j)^2)^2}$ for $i > j$. This is crucial for the solution.  The Kronecker delta $\delta_{i,0}$ is a constant.
*   **External Force:**  The $f_i$ is a constant external force applied to the $i$-th mass.
*   **Unique Solution:** We are given that the solution $u_i$ is unique and exists in a Hilbert space. This is a significant condition that simplifies the analysis.

**2. Setting up the Differential Equation**

The given differential equation is:

$$\Delta u_i = \sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty} J_{ij}(u_i - u_j) = f_i$$

Here,  $f_i$ is a constant external force, and $J_{ij}$ decays rapidly with $|i-j|$.  This means we can consider the differential equation as the sum of a series of infinitely many terms, each of which is a small correction to the initial displacement.  Let's rewrite it as:

$$\Delta u_i = \sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty} J_{ij}(u_i - u_j) = f_i$$

**3.  Applying the Decay Term**

The decay term is key to the problem.  Let's consider a specific case where $f_i = 0$. This means that the external force is zero.  The equation becomes:

$$\Delta u_i = \sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty} J_{ij}(u_i - u_j)$$

Since $J_{ij} \approx \frac{1}{(1 + (i-j)^2)^2}$,  we can approximate this sum as:

$$\sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty} J_{ij}(u_i - u_j) \approx \sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(1 + (i-j)^2)^2} (u_i - u_j)$$

This leads to an *infinite* sum, which is not helpful.

Let's instead consider the case where we can apply the series expansion  $u_i = u_0 + \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{u_k}{n} + \dots$ for some $n$.
If this is the case, then  $\Delta u_i = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{u_k}{n} = f_i$.

However, this can be rewritten as:
$$\Delta u_i = f_i$$

Now, if $f_i = 0$, then the equation becomes:
$$\Delta u_i = 0$$

Therefore, $u_0 = 0$.

**4.  Applying the Hilbert Space Assumption**

Since the solution $u_i$ is unique and exists in a Hilbert space, we can use the properties of Hilbert spaces to explore the problem.

Let $u_i$ be the initial displacement.  The fact that $J_{ij}$ decays rapidly means that we can approximate the solution by a series of terms.  The differential equation `$\Delta u_i = f_i$` can be rewritten as a sum of successive terms:

$\Delta u_i = f_i$

This implies that the solution will be a linear combination of the initial displacement.

This is a very important characteristic. If the initial displacement is unique, it implies that the solution is uniquely defined.

**5. Final Answer**

The value of $u_0$ is 0.

\boxed{u_0 = 0}",u_0 = 0

**Understanding the Problem**

We are given a functional $F(u) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i \|u - v_i\|^2$, where $a_i > 0$ are constants, and $v_i \in H$ are fixed vectors with $\|v_i\| > R$ for all $i$.  We are also told that $\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i = 1$. Our goal is to find the minimum value of $F(u)$ on $B$.

**Analysis and Approach**

The key to finding the minimum lies in understanding the properties of the functional.  The function $F(u)$ is the squared distance of the point $u$ from the origin, and it’s a weighted sum of squared distances. The weighting by the constants $a_i$ dictates the overall influence of each vector.  Since we want to minimize $F(u)$, we want to minimize the squared distance of each point $u$ from the origin.

Since the points $v_i$ are fixed, minimizing $F(u)$ means minimizing the sum of squared distances of the points $u$ to the points $v_i$. The minimal value of the sum of squared distances occurs when the points $v_i$ are as close to the origin as possible.  The minimum value of the squared distance of a point $u$ to the origin is $r^2$, where $r$ is the radius.

**Mathematical Formulation and Intuition**

Let $u$ be a point in $B$. The squared distance between $u$ and $v_i$ is $\|u - v_i\|^2$. We want to minimize $F(u) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i \|u - v_i\|^2$.

The minimum value of $F(u)$ occurs when $v_i$ are as close to the origin as possible.  This means that the vector $v_i$ should be close to the origin.  Since $v_i$ are fixed, we can make the values of $a_i$ and the sum $\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i = 1$ arbitrarily large.  

However, we are minimizing the sum of squared distances.  If $a_i$ are fixed, the sum of squared distances is minimized when $a_i$ is minimized and $v_i$ is minimized.  If $a_i$ are all equal, then the sum of squared distances becomes minimized.

**Finding the Minimum**

Since $F(u)$ is the sum of squared distances, we want to minimize the sum of squared distances of the $v_i$'s.  The minimum value of $F(u)$ occurs when the $v_i$'s are close to the origin, so the distances from $u$ to the $v_i$'s are close to zero.

Therefore, the minimum value of $F(u)$ occurs when all $a_i = 1$, and all $v_i$ are very close to the origin.  In this case, the minimum value of $F(u)$ is:

$F(u) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i \|u - v_i\|^2 \approx \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1^2 = \frac{1}{2}$.

**Final Answer**

The minimum value of $F(u)$ on $B$ is $\frac{1}{2}$.

This problem deals with finding the smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ that satisfies a given eigenvalue problem while simultaneously enforcing the constraint that the function also satisfies the sum of the function equals zero.

**Explanation**

1. **The Problem Statement:** We have a discrete eigenvalue problem:

   $$-\Delta u_i = \lambda u_i, \quad i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$$

   This means that for each integer `i` from 1 to `N`, the function `u_i` is an eigenvalue, and its corresponding eigenvalue is given by $\lambda_i$. The boundary conditions are crucial:  `u_0 = 0` and `u_N = 0`.  This implies that the function must be zero at the boundaries.

2. **The Boundary Conditions:**
   * `u_0 = 0`:  The value of `u_0` is zero.
   * `u_N = 0`: The value of `u_N` is zero.

3. **The Constraint:  Sum of the Function = 0:**  The sum of all the function values `u_i` over all `i` must equal zero.  Mathematically, this means:

   $$\sum_{i=1}^N u_i = 0$$

4. **The Equation:** The equation  `-\Delta u_i = \lambda u_i` is the core of the problem.  It's a linear homogeneous system of equations.

5. **Finding the Eigenvalue:** For a given eigenvalue `λ`, we can solve this system of equations. The general solution to this system will be a linear combination of the function `u_i`. Specifically, we can express `u_i` as:

   $$u_i = a_1 *λ^i + a_2 *λ^i + ... + a_n *λ^i$$

   where `a_i` are constants.

6. **The Key Insight & The Constraint’s Impact:** The constraint `∑u_i = 0` gives us an additional equation.  It means that the sum of the function values must be zero.   Solving the system  `-\Delta u_i = \lambda u_i`  for λ  relates to the sum of the function.  This is a powerful concept. The constraint on the sum leads us to seek for a λ such that the sum is zero.

7. **Finding the Minimum λ:** We want to find the smallest eigenvalue `λ` such that the equation $-\Delta u_i = \lambda u_i$ and the constraint $\sum u_i = 0$ is satisfied.  This is equivalent to finding the smallest λ that satisfies both.

**Solution & Derivation**

Let's consider the case when *N* is very large.  The sum of the function is zero for any λ. Therefore, the condition ∑u_i = 0 is also satisfied for any λ. Thus, we are looking for the smallest λ such that the equation $-\Delta u_i = \lambda u_i$ holds for all *i*.

If the function were a linear polynomial, then the sum of the function is equal to the number of values.

Consider the case where the function is a simple linear polynomial, $f(x) = ax + b$.  Then we have:

$$-\Delta(ax + b) = \lambda(ax+b)$$

which simplifies to:
$$-a^2 x + \lambda b = a^2 x + \lambda b$$

$$0 = (a^2 - a^2)x = 0$$

So, any λ is a solution to the equation, and the sum of the function equals zero. Thus, we want the smallest λ > 0.  This occurs when the function value is 0 at the boundaries.

**Finding the Smallest λ**

Given that $\lambda > 0$, we seek for the smallest positive eigenvalue.  The smallest such λ is simply zero. However, since we must have $\lambda>0$, we consider the next smallest eigenvalue. 

The minimum λ value for the constraint to be satisfied is the smallest λ where the equation becomes zero.

Let's explore the constraint more.

We know that the function must satisfy the sum of the function equals zero. Let $n$ be the number of values. Then $sum u_i = 0$. This implies the sum of the function should be 0. We need to find the smallest λ such that the equation $-\Delta u_i = \lambda u_i$ holds for all $i$.

Since $u_i$ is linearly dependent, then $\lambda$ is the minimal eigenvalue.

To find the smallest λ, consider the case where the function is constant. If $u_i = C$, then $-\Delta C = \lambda C$. This becomes $0 = \lambda C$, so $\lambda = 0$. However, $\lambda > 0$.

If we have the system $0 = \lambda u_i$, then $\lambda = 0$ is the smallest possible eigenvalue.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\lambda_1 = 0}",\lambda_1 = 0

**Understanding the Problem**

We are given a linear recurrence relation:  $u_{n+1} = a u_n + b u_{n-1}$ with initial conditions $u_0 = 2$ and $u_1 = a+1$. We need to find a generating function $V(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty v_n z^n$ such that $v_n = u_n + c \cdot n$.  The goal is to express this generating function in closed form.

**Step 1: Find the First Few Terms**

Let's calculate the first few terms of the sequence to get a feel for the problem.

*   $u_0 = 2$
*   $u_1 = a+1$
*   $u_2 = a u_1 + b u_0 = a(a+1) + b(2) = a^2 + a + 2b$
*   $u_3 = a u_2 + b u_1 = a(a^2 + a + 2b) + b(a+1) = a^3 + a^2 + 2ab + ab + b = a^3 + 3a^2 + 3ab + b$
*   $u_4 = a u_3 + b u_2 = a(a^3 + 3a^2 + 3ab + b) + b(a^2 + a + 2b) = a^4 + 3a^3 + 3a^2b + ab + b^3 + ab + 2b^2 = a^4 + 3a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab + b^3 + 2b^2$

We can observe a pattern.  Let's assume $v_n = u_n + c \cdot n$ for some constant $c$.

Then $v_0 = u_0 + c \cdot 0 = 2 + 0 = 2$, which is consistent with the initial condition $u_0 = 2$.
$v_1 = u_1 + c \cdot 1 = (a+1) + c = a+1+c$.

Now, consider the recurrence relation $u_{n+1} = a u_n + b u_{n-1}$.
Substituting $v_n = u_n + c \cdot n$ into the recurrence, we get:

$v_{n+1} = u_{n+1} + c \cdot n = a u_n + b u_{n-1} + c \cdot n = a u_n + b u_{n-1} + c n$.

Since $v_n = u_n + c \cdot n$, we have $v_{n+1} = u_{n+1} + c \cdot n = a u_n + b u_{n-1} + c \cdot n$.

Now, let's consider the sequence of $v_n$. We have $v_0 = 2$, $v_1 = a+1$. Let's consider a simple case where $a=1$ and $b=1$.

Then $u_n = n+1$ for $n \ge 0$.  
Then $v_n = u_n + c \cdot n = n+1 + c \cdot n = (1+c)n + 1$.
$V(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty v_n z^n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty ((1+c)n + 1) z^n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty ((1+c)n z^n + z^n) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty ((1+c)n z^n) + \sum_{n=0}^\infty z^n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty ((1+c)n z^n) + 1 + 0 = \sum_{n=0}^\infty ((1+c)n z^n) + 1$.

Let's try a case with $a=1, b=0$, then $u_n = n+1$. $u_0 = 2$, $u_1 = 2$, $u_2 = 3$, $u_3 = 4$.
$v_n = u_n + c \cdot n = n+1 + c \cdot n$.

$V(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+1+c \cdot n) z^n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+1) z^n + \sum_{n=0}^\infty c n z^n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+1) z^n + c \sum_{n=0}^\infty n z^n$.

The formula for the generating function of $e^{z^n}$ is $e^{z^n} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{z^k}{k!}$.

We are given that $v_n = u_n + c \cdot n$.

Let $V(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty v_n z^n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (u_n + c \cdot n) z^n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (u_n z^n + c n z^n) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty u_n z^n + \sum_{n=0}^\infty c n z^n$.

Since $u_0 = 2$, $u_1 = a+1$, and $a^2+4b > 0$, we have $a > -2$.

Consider $a=1$. Then $4b > 0 \implies b > 0$.
$V(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty z^n = 1+z+z^2+ \dots$.

Since $u_{n+1} = a u_n + b u_{n-1}$, we can write $u_n = c_1 + c_2 \cdot n + \dots$.

Consider $a=1$, $b=1$.  Then $u_n = n+1$.

The generating function for the recurrence is $V(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty v_n z^n$.

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a nonlocal discrete problem involving the sum of terms involving the values of `u_i` and `f_i` over a finite number of terms (`N`).  The core of the problem lies in the boundary conditions:  `u_0 = 0`, `u_{N+1} = 0`, and the condition that the determinant of a matrix formed by the terms is non-zero.

The given equation is:

$-u_{i+1} + 2u_i - u_{i-1} = f_i + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^N u_j$

where `f_i` are given values and `N` is the number of terms.

**Solving the Equation**

Let's rewrite the equation as:

$-u_{i+1} + 2u_i - u_{i-1} - f_i - \alpha \sum_{j=1}^N u_j = 0$

Now, consider the case when `N = 1`. Then we have:

$-u_2 + 2u_1 - u_0 - f_1 - \alpha u_1 = 0$
$ -u_2 + 2u_1 - 0 - f_1 - \alpha u_1 = 0$
$ -u_2 + (2 - \alpha) u_1 - f_1 = 0$

This gives us a linear equation in terms of `u_1`.  Since we're looking for a solution in terms of `u_j` for all `j` from 1 to `N`, we can use the boundary conditions to solve for a particular value of `u_1`.

**Considering the Boundary Conditions**

We have `u_0 = 0`, `u_{N+1} = 0`. Substituting these into the equation:

$-u_2 + (2 - \alpha) u_1 - f_1 = 0$

$ -u_2 = f_1 - (2 - \alpha) u_1$
$ u_2 = f_1 - (2 - \alpha) u_1$

We can now use the boundary conditions to solve for the value of `u_1`.

**Applying the Boundary Conditions**

We have $u_0 = 0$ and $u_{N+1} = 0$.

$ u_0 = 0 \Rightarrow -u_2 = f_1 - (2 - \alpha) u_1 \Rightarrow u_2 = f_1 - (2 - \alpha) u_1$

Substituting the value for `u_2` in the equation for `u_1` in terms of `N`

$ u_2 = f_1 - (2 - \alpha) u_1$

Since we are looking for the general solution we can consider the case of a linear system.

We can consider the case when `N = 2`.

$ -u_3 + 2u_2 - u_1 = f_2 + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^2 u_j$

$ -u_3 + 2u_2 - u_1 = f_2 + \alpha u_1 + \alpha u_2$

Now consider the case when `N = 3`.

$ -u_4 + 2u_3 - u_2 = f_3 + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^3 u_j$

$ -u_4 + 2u_3 - u_2 = f_3 + \alpha u_1 + \alpha u_2 + \alpha u_3$

Let's proceed as follows:
Let’s choose the case when `N = 1`.

$ -u_{1+1} + 2u_1 - u_{1-1} = f_1 + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^1 u_j$
$-u_2 + 2u_1 - u_0 = f_1 + \alpha u_1$
$-u_2 + 2u_1 - 0 = f_1 + \alpha u_1$
$-u_2 = f_1 + \alpha u_1 - 2u_1 = f_1 - \alpha u_1$
$u_2 = f_1 - \alpha u_1$

Now consider the case when `N = 2`.

$ -u_3 + 2u_2 - u_1 = f_2 + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^2 u_j$
$-u_3 + 2u_2 - u_1 = f_2 + \alpha u_1 + \alpha u_2$

Let's consider the case when `N = 3`.

$ -u_4 + 2u_3 - u_2 = f_3 + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^3 u_j$
$-u_4 + 2u_3 - u_2 = f_3 + \alpha u_1 + \alpha u_2 + \alpha u_3$

However, we can solve the equation for the case when the determinant is zero.

The determinant condition implies that the sum of the terms in the summation must be zero.
$$\sum_{j=1}^N u_j = 0$$

Consider the case when `N = 1`. Then we have $-u_2 = f_1 - (2 - \alpha) u_1$ which is equivalent to $u_2 = f_1 - (2 - \alpha) u_1$.

If `N = 2`, then $-u_3 + 2u_2 - u_1 = f_2 + \alpha u_1 + \alpha u_2$ which is equivalent to $-u_3 + 2u_2 - u_1 = f_2 + \alpha u_1 + \alpha u_2$.

**Understanding the Problem**

The sphere is released from rest on an inclined plane.  We want to find the maximum angle $\theta$ (the angle the sphere makes with the horizontal) for which it rolls without slipping.  Rolling without slipping means that the sphere's angular velocity remains constant.  When a sphere rolls without slipping, it gradually changes direction due to the component of gravity acting parallel to the inclined plane.

**Key Concepts**

* **Static Friction:** Static friction opposes the motion of an object when it's at rest.
* **Rolling without Slipping:** This occurs when the sphere's angular velocity remains constant.  In simpler terms, the sphere rotates at a constant speed.
* **Angular Momentum:**  A measure of an object's tendency to keep rotating. It depends on the object's mass and its rotational speed.
* **Newton's Second Law (F = ma):** The force of friction acts downwards, opposing the normal force (which is the force exerted by the inclined plane).

**Derivation**

1. **Forces Acting on the Sphere:**
   * **Gravitational Force (Fg):**  Acting downwards, towards the center of the sphere.  Fg = mg, where 'm' is the mass and 'g' is the acceleration due to gravity.
   * **Normal Force (N):**  Acting perpendicular to the inclined plane.  N = mg cos(θ), where θ is the angle of inclination.
   * **Frictional Force (Ff):**  Acting opposite to the angular velocity,  Ff = \mu_s * N = \mu_s * mg cos(θ)

2. **Centripetal Force:**
   For the sphere to roll without slipping, the net force acting on it must be equal to the centripetal force required for the circular motion. The centripetal force is given by:
   F_c = m * v^2 / R  where v is the velocity of the sphere and R is the radius of the sphere.

3. **Conservation of Angular Momentum:**
   Since the sphere is at rest, the angular momentum of the system (sphere + plane) is zero.  This is derived from the principle that the total angular momentum of a closed system remains constant.  Therefore, the sum of the torques about any point must be zero. In this case, the torque due to the gravitational force must equal the torque due to the frictional force.

   τ_grav = τ_f  =>  mg * (v^2 / R) = \mu_s * mg * cos(θ)

4. **Solving for v:**
   Notice that 'v' cancels out from both sides:
   v^2 / R = \mu_s * cos(θ)
   v = sqrt(R^2 / (μ_s * R)) = R / sqrt(μ_s)

5. **Determining the Maximum Angle (θ):**
   The maximum value of `v` occurs when the sphere rolls without slipping.  This means the angular velocity is constant.  Therefore, the angle $\theta$ is such that:
   v = R / sqrt(μ_s)
   $\theta = \frac{v}{R} = \frac{R}{sqrt(μ_s)}$

**Final Answer:**

The maximum value of $\theta$ for which the sphere will roll without slipping is  $$\boxed{\frac{R}{ \sqrt{μ_s}}}$$",\frac{R

**Understanding the Problem**

We are dealing with a harmonic oscillator, a system that oscillates with a definite frequency. We're given a potential energy function $V(x) = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 + \frac{\lambda}{4} x^4$. The particle's mass is $m$, the potential is confined to a one-dimensional region, and we want to calculate the first-order correction to its energy levels, which we will do using perturbation theory.

**Perturbation Theory Approach**

The fundamental principle of perturbation theory is to approximate the behavior of a system near a point by considering the effects of small perturbations. In this case, we're focusing on the first-order correction to the energy levels because the original harmonic oscillator has a very simple energy level.

**Steps in Perturbation Theory**

1. **The Original Harmonic Oscillator:**  First, we need to determine the energy levels of the original harmonic oscillator. The energy levels of a harmonic oscillator are given by:

   $E_n = \frac{n^2 h}{8 k}$, where 'n' is the quantum number, 'h' is Planck's constant, and 'k' is the spring constant.

2. **The Perturbation:** We introduce a small perturbation, denoted by $δV$, to the potential energy:

   $δV = V(x) - V_0 = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 + \frac{\lambda}{4} x^4 - V_0$

   where $V_0$ is the exact energy level (which we’ll assume is the ground state for simplicity).

3. **The Perturbation Expansion:** We'll expand the perturbation in terms of the small parameter $\delta x$:

   $δV = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} V_0 + \frac{\delta x^2}{2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} V_0 + \dots$

4. **Applying the Expansion:**  The expansion will be a Taylor series around the point where the perturbation is small (i.e., $\delta x$ is very small).  The integral term will be the key to obtaining the correction.

**Calculations and Final Answer**

Let's consider the energy level of the harmonic oscillator.

The energy of the harmonic oscillator is given by:

$E = \frac{h^2}{8 k} m$

Let's calculate the first-order correction to the energy by taking the first-order expansion of the energy in terms of the perturbation:

$E_n = E_0 + \frac{\delta x^2}{2} E_0 + \frac{\delta x^4}{24} E_0^2 + \dots$

Where $E_0$ is the exact energy.

We can rewrite this as:

$E_n = E_0 + \frac{\delta x^2}{2} E_0 + \frac{\delta x^4}{24} E_0^2 + \dots$

Substituting the known energy levels of the harmonic oscillator, we get:

$E_n = \frac{h^2}{8 k} m + \frac{\delta x^2}{2} \frac{h^2}{8 k} m + \frac{\delta x^4}{24} \frac{h^2}{8 k} m^2 + \dots$

Simplifying,

$E_n = \frac{h^2}{8 k} m + \frac{\delta x^2}{2} \frac{h^2}{8 k} m + \frac{\delta x^4}{24} \frac{h^2}{8 k} m^2 + O(\delta x^2)$

Therefore, the first-order correction to the energy of the harmonic oscillator is:

$E_n = \frac{h^2}{8k} m + \frac{\delta x^2}{2} \frac{h^2}{8k} m + \frac{\delta x^4}{24} \frac{h^2}{8k} m^2 + O(\delta x^2)$

where $\delta x$ is the perturbation parameter.

**Final Answer:**

The first-order correction to the energy of the harmonic oscillator is:

$$E_n = \frac{h^2}{8k} m + \frac{\delta x^2}{2} \frac{h^2}{8k} m + \frac{\delta x^4}{24} \frac{h^2}{8k} m^2 + O(\delta x^2)$$

The value of $m$ does not affect the expression; it is the mass.  The value of $k$ does.

\boxed{E_n = \frac{h^2}{8k} m + \frac{\delta x^2}{2} \frac{h^2}{8k} m + \frac{\delta x^4}{24} \frac{h^2}{8k} m^2 + O(\delta x^2)}}$",E_n = \frac{h^2

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two identical conducting spheres, each with a radius *a*. They are separated by a distance *d* (where *d* is significantly larger than the radius *a*).  One sphere has a charge +Q, and the other has a charge -Q. We want to find the electrostatic potential midway between the two spheres, *r* = *d* / 2, relative to infinity. This means we need to calculate the potential at a distance of *r* from each sphere.

**The Concept of Electrostatic Potential**

The electrostatic potential (Φ) at a point due to a charge *q* is given by:

Φ = q / (4πε₀r)

where:
*   q is the magnitude of the charge
*   ε₀ is the permittivity of free space (approximately 8.854 x 10⁻¹² C²/Nm²)
*   r is the distance from the point to the charge

**Analysis**

Since the spheres are identical and separated by a large distance *d*, the electrostatic potential at the midway point *r* will be nearly the same as the potential at infinity.  The potential at infinity (Φ<sub>∞</sub>) is given by:

Φ<sub>∞</sub> = q / (4πε₀)

The potential at a distance *r* from each sphere is the difference between the potential at infinity and the potential at the midpoint:

Φ<sub>mid</sub> = Φ<sub>∞</sub> - (q / (4πε₀r))

**Calculation**

Let's consider the potential at the midway point *r* = *d* / 2:

Φ<sub>mid</sub> = q / (4πε₀) - (q / (4πε₀)(d/2))
Φ<sub>mid</sub> = q / (4πε₀) - (q / (8πε₀))
Φ<sub>mid</sub> = q / (4πε₀) - q / (8πε₀)
Φ<sub>mid</sub> = q / (8πε₀)

**Approximate Expression**

Therefore, the approximate electrostatic potential midway between the two spheres, relative to infinity, is:

Φ<sub>mid</sub> ≈  q / (8πε₀)

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{Φ<sub>mid</sub> ≈  q / (8πε₀)}

**Order of the Answer:** (a/d)^3

**Explanation of the Order**

The order (a/d)^3 is chosen because the potential depends on the distance *d* and the radius *a*.  The key is to find the potential at a distance *r* from each sphere.  The potential at *r* is approximately the same as the potential at infinity. Thus, if we find the potential at *r*, we can determine its approximate value relative to infinity.

This is a classic problem in special relativity that involves the concept of time dilation and length contraction. Here’s a detailed explanation, including the steps and the final answer:

**Understanding the Concepts**

*   **Relativistic Acceleration:**  We're dealing with an acceleration that’s *not* due to gravity.  This acceleration is a consequence of the principle of equivalence – that the inertial frame of reference (where we're observing the rocket) and the rotating frame of reference (where the rocket is moving) are indistinguishable.
*   **Time Dilation:**  Time slows down for objects in motion relative to a stationary observer.  The faster an object moves, the slower time passes for it.
*   **Length Contraction:**  The length of an object in the direction of motion contracts from the perspective of a stationary observer.
*   **Initial State:** We start with the rocket at rest (x(0) = 0) in the rest frame.

**Derivation of the Velocity and Position**

Let's set up a coordinate system.  Let the rest frame be the initial frame, and let’s use the new inertial frame we’ll define later.

1.  **Initial State:**  At t=0, the rocket is at rest, so its position is x(0) = 0.

2.  **Proper Acceleration:** The rocket accelerates with a constant acceleration *a*.  This means that the net acceleration is *a*.

3.  **Velocity as a function of time:**  The velocity vector  **v(t)** at any time *t* can be calculated using the following formula:

    **v(t) = v₀ + a * t**

    where *v₀* is the initial velocity of the rocket (which is 0).

4.  **Position as a function of time:**  The rocket's position can be determined using the following equation:

    **x(t) = x(0) + v₀ * t + (1/2) * a² * t²**

    Substituting x(0) = 0, we get:

    **x(t) =  0 + 0 * t + (1/2) * a² * t² = (1/2) * a² * t²**

5.  **Final Answer:**

    The rocket's velocity *v(t)* as a function of time *t* is:

    **v(t) = (1/2) * a² * t²**

    The rocket's position *x(t)* as a function of time *t* is:

    **x(t) = (1/2) * a² * t²**

**Conclusion**

The rocket's velocity is  **v(t) = (1/2) * a² * t²** and its position is **x(t) = (1/2) * a² * t²**.  The rocket's velocity is *always* *positive*, and its position is *always* *positive*.

**Important Note:** This solution relies on the fundamental principle of equivalence.  The key is to recognize that the acceleration is *proper* acceleration, which is acceleration *relative to the initial inertial frame*.

This problem deals with the concept of a ""half-box"" and utilizes the Boltzmann statistics to understand the probability distribution.

**Understanding the Problem**

1.  **Box and Particles:** We have a three-dimensional box of volume $V$.  We have $N$ identical, non-interacting particles of mass $m$ distributed within this box.  The particles are indistinguishable, meaning the arrangement of the particles within the box doesn't matter.  We're considering the probability of their spatial distribution within a specific region.

2.  **Boltzmann Statistics:** The particles follow Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics.  This means their velocities are distributed according to a Boltzmann distribution – their probability of being in a particular state (position) is proportional to the Boltzmann factor.

3.  **Half-Box:** We want to find the probability that all $N$ particles reside within a region that is half of the box.  This is a classic problem involving the concept of a ""half-box"" or ""half-region.""

**Derivation**

Let's consider the box.  We can visualize the box as a volume $V$.  The particles are distributed within this volume.  The probability of a single particle being in a particular location is proportional to the volume occupied by that particle.

1.  **Probability of a particle being in a specific region:**  The total volume of the box is $V$.  If we assume the particles are uniformly distributed within the box, the probability that a given particle is in a specific region is simply the volume of that region divided by the total volume.

2.  **Probability of all particles in one half:**  We want to calculate the probability that *all* $N$ particles are within one half of the box. This means that *exactly* half of the particles are in one half of the box.  

3.  **Boltzmann Distribution:**  The Boltzmann distribution states that the probability of a particle being in a region is proportional to the number of particles in that region.  Therefore, the probability that all $N$ particles are in one half of the box is the same as the probability that the particles are uniformly distributed within the *middle* of the box.

4. **Calculating the Probability:**
   *   The volume of the middle region is $\frac{1}{2}V$.
   *   The number of particles in the middle region is $\frac{N}{2}$.
   *   The probability that all $N$ particles are in the middle region is:
     $P = \frac{\text{Number of particles in middle}}{\text{Total number of particles}} = \frac{N/2}{N} = \frac{1}{2}$

Therefore, the probability that all $N$ particles are located in one half of the box is $\frac{1}{2}$.
