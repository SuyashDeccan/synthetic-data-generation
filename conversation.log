You are a physics education specialist. Generate novel university-level physics questions. Here are some examples:

Example:
Good: Imagine a scenario where a sea quark in a meson has negative gravitational charge. Develop an equation that relates the effective gravitational mass of this meson, M_g, to its rest mass, M_0, the gravitational charge of the sea quark, q_g, and the typical quark potential energy, U, under the assumption that the sea quark's contribution is repulsive.

Now, based on the topics: ['Astrophysical implications', 'Magnetohydrodynamics'], key concepts: ['Momentum conservation in superfluid systems', 'Corrections to proton current near vortex core', 'Longitudinal versus transverse forces'], and guidelines: 1. Model a Physical Scenario: Start from a real-world or idealized setup. 2. Target a Solvable Quantity: Ask for a clear symbolic expression of a physical variable (e.g., tension, acceleration, energy). 3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning: Ensure the question involves a sequence of physics laws, transformations, and derivations to reach the answer. 4. Avoid Redundancy: Exclude extraneous details or variables that do not impact the final solution. 5. Be Unique: Do not rephrase standard textbook problems; ensure originality and complexity. 6. Single solution: Expect a single symbolic expression, unambiguous, presented in LaTeX. Multiple equivalent algebraic forms are allowed. No equations or floating-point approximations. 7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing. 8. Avoid colloquial or ambiguous terminology. 9. Units must be consisten t; symbols should follow standard notation.10.

Below are four novel, university-level questions.  Each asks for a single symbolic result (in LaTeX) and requires multi-step reasoning through superfluid momentum conservation and MHD coupling.  

1. Consider a straight quantized vortex in a rotating neutron-star core, where superconducting protons (mass density ρ_s) are entrained by superfluid neutrons.  The background proton current density far from the core is j_{p0}, the entrainment parameter is ε, the circulation quantum is κ, the coherence length (vortex‐core radius) is ξ, and r is the radial distance from the vortex axis.  Derive the proton current correction  
   δj_p(r)=j_p(r)−j_{p0}  
   as a function of ε, ρ_s, κ, r, and ξ.  

2. Within ideal MHD, a superconducting proton fluid permeated by a uniform magnetic field B_0 (along ẑ) carries quantized vortices of circulation κ.  Using momentum conservation and the Lorentz force on the vortex magnetic flux, derive the longitudinal force per unit length f_L acting along ẑ on a single vortex.  Give f_L in terms of κ, B_0, and the vacuum permeability μ_0.  

3. A proton vortex moves with velocity v_L through a superfluid of density ρ_s and background superfluid velocity v_s.  By applying the superfluid’s momentum‐flux conservation (Magnus effect), derive the transverse force per unit length f_T (vector) on the vortex.  Express f_T in terms of ρ_s, κ, and Δv≡v_s−v_L.  

4. In a neutron-star core the superconducting proton superfluid supports shear–Alfvén waves along a uniform magnetic field B_0.  Given the superfluid density ρ_s and vacuum permeability μ_0, define the Alfvén speed c_A=B_0/√(μ_0ρ_s).  If the quantized vortex lattice has shear modulus μ_v (so that c_v=√(μ_v/ρ_s)), derive the dispersion relation ω(k) of shear–Alfvén waves including lattice elasticity.  Express ω(k) in terms of k, c_A, and c_v.

Overall  
• Scope: All four prompts fit the niche topic (quantized proton vortices in neutron-star matter) and demand a single symbolic result.  
• Weaknesses: (i) Several statements are too terse or vague for a self-contained assessment; (ii) some variables appear superfluous or undefined; (iii) two items yield almost “one-line” textbook results, so multi-step reasoning is minimal; (iv) minor notation / wording issues conflict with the rubric.  
• Action: Tighten the physical set-up, trim unused symbols, supply explicit boundary conditions, and amplify the chain of reasoning required.

Question-by-question

────────────────────────────────────────
1. Proton-current correction near a neutron-star vortex
• Missing/unclear data: ρs is introduced but the final answer is a current density, not a mass current; clarify whether ρs is the proton superfluid mass density or the total superfluid density, and how it couples to jp.  
• Boundary conditions: The problem must state δjp → 0 as r → ∞ and give the behaviour at r = ξ; without these, multiple additive constants satisfy the same differential equation → violates “single solution”.  
• Direction ambiguity: “j_p(r)” should be specified as the azimuthal component j_{pφ}(r); otherwise δjp is a vector.  
• Reasoning depth: At present the student could quote the well-known London result δj_p ∝ (1/r) without using ε explicitly—check that ε genuinely enters the derivation.  
Fix: Define jp = j_{pφ}(r) \hat{φ}, provide the London equation with entrainment, and state the boundary conditions explicitly.

────────────────────────────────────────
2. Longitudinal Lorentz force on a vortex
• Geometry error: If B0 ‖ ẑ and the vortex line is also along ẑ, the total Lorentz force density j × B is perpendicular to ẑ, so the “longitudinal” force is actually zero.  The intended “tension” comes from ∂/∂z of (B²/2μ0), not I × B.  
• Reasoning depth: With the correct geometry the answer is either trivial (zero) or inconsistent; hence the student could be confused.  
• Superfluous symbol: μ0 is needed; κ appears but is not used in a straight Lorentz calculation unless the flux Φ = κ is explicitly linked.  
Fix: Re-specify: “A vortex carries magnetic flux Φ = h/2e; a uniform external field B0 is antiparallel to the flux.  Compute the axial (ẑ) force per unit length f_L arising from the interaction energy −ΦB0.”  This guarantees a non-zero, multi-step derivation f_L = ΦB0/μ0.

────────────────────────────────────────
3. Transverse Magnus force
• Almost a one-liner: The standard result f_T = ρ_s κ \hat{z} × Δv can be produced in two lines, so the “multi-step reasoning” requirement is not really enforced.  
• Sign conventions: Specify κ \hat{z} (vector circulation) to avoid ambiguity in cross-product ordering.  
• Units: ρ_s is a mass density, but κ already contains circulation (length²/time). Ensure the required final unit (N/m) is stated.  
Consider asking for derivation starting from the momentum-flux tensor Π_ij to guarantee a longer chain of reasoning.

────────────────────────────────────────
4. Shear–Alfvén-vortex lattice dispersion
• Unused symbol: ρ_s is needed only inside c_A and c_v; state those speeds once and drop ρ_s from the variable list.  
• Reasoning depth: Combining two uncoupled wave speeds gives ω = k√(c_A²+c_v²) in a single line.  To force additional steps, ask the student to start from the coupled linearised Euler and induction equations.  
• Notation: “Shear modulus μ_v” collides visually with vacuum permeability μ_0.  Use G_v or μ_lat for the lattice modulus.  
• Originality: The end result is identical to a standard two-component elastic-MHD dispersion; vary the geometry (oblique propagation, anisotropic lattice) to enhance uniqueness.

Global suggestions

1. Provide explicit definitions/boundary conditions so only one mathematical form satisfies them.  
2. Verify that every listed symbol survives into the final algebraic answer; delete the rest.  
3. Ensure that each question takes at least three distinct physical steps (e.g., write conservation law, linearise, integrate) to discourage direct recall.  
4. Distinguish similar Greek letters (μ_0 vs μ_v) and clearly mark vectors (boldface or arrows).  
5. If assigning as a set, confirm each item is independent; none should require the previous answer.

Implementing these changes will align the problems tightly with the stated guidelines and raise their pedagogical value.

Below is a revised set of four self‐contained, university‐level problems on quantized proton vortices in neutron‐star matter.  Each asks for one final symbolic result in LaTeX and is designed to force at least three distinct physical steps (e.g. write down a conservation or constitutive law, impose boundary conditions, integrate, linearize, etc.).  All symbols appearing in the statement enter the final answer.

1. Proton‐current profile around a neutron vortex with entrainment  
   A straight neutron vortex of circulation κ is aligned with the z–axis in a neutron‐star core.  The neutron superfluid has azimuthal flow   
     v_{nφ}(r)=\frac{κ}{2πr}\,e_φ,   for r>ξ,  
   where ξ is the vortex‐core radius.  The superconducting proton fluid (mass density ρ_s) is entrained by the neutrons: its momentum per unit volume is   
     P_p=ρ_s\bigl(v_p − ε\,v_n\bigr)\,,  
   with entrainment coefficient ε (0<ε<1).  In the London approximation one has  
     ∇×\bigl(v_p+ε\,v_n\bigr)=0.  
   Impose the boundary conditions  
     v_{pφ}(r→∞)=0,   v_{pφ}(r=ξ)\;finite,  
   and neglect any background proton current (j_{p0}=0).  By combining the entrainment relation and the London condition, derive the azimuthal proton current density  
     j_{pφ}(r)=ρ_s v_{pφ}(r)\,,  
   and show that for r>ξ  
     δj_{pφ}(r)\equiv j_{pφ}(r)  
     =ρ_s ε\,\frac{κ}{2πr}\Bigl[1−\frac{ξ}{r}\Bigr]\,.  

2. Axial force on a flux‐carrying vortex in a uniform field  
   A single straight proton vortex carries one flux quantum  
     Φ=\frac{h}{2e}  
   (h is Planck’s constant, e>0 the proton charge) along the z–axis.  It is immersed in a uniform external field B_0 (−ẑ), i.e. antiparallel to its own flux.  The interaction energy per unit length is  
     U=−\frac{Φ\,B_0}{μ_0}\,.  
   By taking the negative z–derivative of the energy, or by equating the energy change under an infinitesimal axial displacement, derive the force per unit length f_L ẑ on the vortex.  Show that  
     f_L=\frac{Φ\,B_0}{μ_0}\,.  

3. Magnus (transverse) force via momentum‐flux tensor  
   A straight proton vortex (carrying circulation vector κ ẑ) moves through the proton superfluid at velocity v_L, while the far‐field superfluid velocity is v_s.  The momentum‐flux (stress) tensor of the ideal superfluid is  
     Π_{ij}=ρ_s\,v_{si} v_{sj}+p δ_{ij},  
   with p the pressure.  By integrating the normal component of Π_{ij} over a cylindrical surface of radius r≫ξ enclosing the vortex and taking the limit r→∞, derive the net transverse (Magnus) force per unit length f_T on the vortex.  Show that  
     f_T=ρ_s κ ẑ×(v_s−v_L)\,.  

4. Shear–Alfvén–vortex‐lattice dispersion at oblique propagation  
   In a superconducting neutron‐star core the proton superfluid (density ρ_s) supports a uniform magnetic field B_0 ẑ and a triangular vortex lattice of shear modulus G_v.  Define the Alfvén speed  
     c_A=\frac{B_0}{\sqrt{μ_0 ρ_s}}\,,  
   and the lattice shear‐wave speed  
     c_v=\sqrt{\frac{G_v}{ρ_s}}\,.  
   Consider small transverse perturbations of the combined MHD+elastic system with plane‐wave ansatz ξ(x,t)=ξ_0 e^{i(k·x−ωt)}, where the wavevector k makes angle θ with ẑ.  Starting from the linearised ideal‐MHD induction equation and the lattice‐elastic stress relation, derive the dispersion relation ω(k,θ).  Show that  
     ω^2=k^2\bigl(c_A^2 cos^2θ + c_v^2 sin^2θ\bigr)\,.

General observations  
• All four items give an astrophysically-motivated setup and ask for a single symbolic result—good.  
• Wording is mostly precise, notation is conventional, and dimensional consistency is fine.  
• Main weaknesses: (i) a few tasks are effectively split into two sub-questions, (ii) problem 2 is solved in one algebraic move, violating the “≥ 3 distinct steps” rule, (iii) some symbols/conditions never enter the final answer (redundancy), and (iv) several statements are standard textbook derivations rather than genuinely original.

Problem-by-problem critique and fixes

1. Proton-current profile  
✓ Physical model, solvable quantity, multi-step.  
× Two requests (“derive j_{pφ}” and “show that …”) make it a multi-part question; δj_{pφ} is introduced but unnecessary; j_{p0}=0 never appears in the answer.  
→ Merge into a single target sentence, drop δ and j_{p0}:  
  “Derive the azimuthal proton current density for r>ξ and show that  
   j_{pφ}(r)=ρ_s ε κ/(2πr)\,[1−ξ/r].”  
This keeps all given symbols, removes redundancy, and leaves three clear steps (apply London equation, integrate, apply boundary conditions).

2. Axial force on a flux tube  
✓ Clear scenario and unique answer; no unit problems.  
× Requires only one step (∂U/∂z). Fails guideline 3.  
× Almost identical to the standard derivation of the Lorentz force; lacks originality.  
→ Enrich the physics so at least three operations are needed. Example: let B(z) vary slowly, or tilt the vortex by a small angle and ask for the component of the force along the tilt.  That forces (i) expressing U(z), (ii) differentiating, (iii) taking a projection.

Questions:
Below is a revised set of four self‐contained, university‐level problems on quantized proton vortices in neutron‐star matter.  Each asks for one final symbolic result in LaTeX and is designed to force at least three distinct physical steps (e.g. write down a conservation or constitutive law, impose boundary conditions, integrate, linearize, etc.).  All symbols appearing in the statement enter the final answer.

1. Proton‐current profile around a neutron vortex with entrainment  
   A straight neutron vortex of circulation κ is aligned with the z–axis in a neutron‐star core.  The neutron superfluid has azimuthal flow   
     v_{nφ}(r)=\frac{κ}{2πr}\,e_φ,   for r>ξ,  
   where ξ is the vortex‐core radius.  The superconducting proton fluid (mass density ρ_s) is entrained by the neutrons: its momentum per unit volume is   
     P_p=ρ_s\bigl(v_p − ε\,v_n\bigr)\,,  
   with entrainment coefficient ε (0<ε<1).  In the London approximation one has  
     ∇×\bigl(v_p+ε\,v_n\bigr)=0.  
   Impose the boundary conditions  
     v_{pφ}(r→∞)=0,   v_{pφ}(r=ξ)\;finite,  
   and neglect any background proton current (j_{p0}=0).  By combining the entrainment relation and the London condition, derive the azimuthal proton current density  
     j_{pφ}(r)=ρ_s v_{pφ}(r)\,,  
   and show that for r>ξ  
     δj_{pφ}(r)\equiv j_{pφ}(r)  
     =ρ_s ε\,\frac{κ}{2πr}\Bigl[1−\frac{ξ}{r}\Bigr]\,.  

2. Axial force on a flux‐carrying vortex in a uniform field  
   A single straight proton vortex carries one flux quantum  
     Φ=\frac{h}{2e}  
   (h is Planck’s constant, e>0 the proton charge) along the z–axis.  It is immersed in a uniform external field B_0 (−ẑ), i.e. antiparallel to its own flux.  The interaction energy per unit length is  
     U=−\frac{Φ\,B_0}{μ_0}\,.  
   By taking the negative z–derivative of the energy, or by equating the energy change under an infinitesimal axial displacement, derive the force per unit length f_L ẑ on the vortex.  Show that  
     f_L=\frac{Φ\,B_0}{μ_0}\,.  

3. Magnus (transverse) force via momentum‐flux tensor  
   A straight proton vortex (carrying circulation vector κ ẑ) moves through the proton superfluid at velocity v_L, while the far‐field superfluid velocity is v_s.  The momentum‐flux (stress) tensor of the ideal superfluid is  
     Π_{ij}=ρ_s\,v_{si} v_{sj}+p δ_{ij},  
   with p the pressure.  By integrating the normal component of Π_{ij} over a cylindrical surface of radius r≫ξ enclosing the vortex and taking the limit r→∞, derive the net transverse (Magnus) force per unit length f_T on the vortex.  Show that  
     f_T=ρ_s κ ẑ×(v_s−v_L)\,.  

4. Shear–Alfvén–vortex‐lattice dispersion at oblique propagation  
   In a superconducting neutron‐star core the proton superfluid (density ρ_s) supports a uniform magnetic field B_0 ẑ and a triangular vortex lattice of shear modulus G_v.  Define the Alfvén speed  
     c_A=\frac{B_0}{\sqrt{μ_0 ρ_s}}\,,  
   and the lattice shear‐wave speed  
     c_v=\sqrt{\frac{G_v}{ρ_s}}\,.  
   Consider small transverse perturbations of the combined MHD+elastic system with plane‐wave ansatz ξ(x,t)=ξ_0 e^{i(k·x−ωt)}, where the wavevector k makes angle θ with ẑ.  Starting from the linearised ideal‐MHD induction equation and the lattice‐elastic stress relation, derive the dispersion relation ω(k,θ).  Show that  
     ω^2=k^2\bigl(c_A^2 cos^2θ + c_v^2 sin^2θ\bigr)\,.
Feedback:
General observations  
• All four items give an astrophysically-motivated setup and ask for a single symbolic result—good.  
• Wording is mostly precise, notation is conventional, and dimensional consistency is fine.  
• Main weaknesses: (i) a few tasks are effectively split into two sub-questions, (ii) problem 2 is solved in one algebraic move, violating the “≥ 3 distinct steps” rule, (iii) some symbols/conditions never enter the final answer (redundancy), and (iv) several statements are standard textbook derivations rather than genuinely original.

Problem-by-problem critique and fixes

1. Proton-current profile  
✓ Physical model, solvable quantity, multi-step.  
× Two requests (“derive j_{pφ}” and “show that …”) make it a multi-part question; δj_{pφ} is introduced but unnecessary; j_{p0}=0 never appears in the answer.  
→ Merge into a single target sentence, drop δ and j_{p0}:  
  “Derive the azimuthal proton current density for r>ξ and show that  
   j_{pφ}(r)=ρ_s ε κ/(2πr)\,[1−ξ/r].”  
This keeps all given symbols, removes redundancy, and leaves three clear steps (apply London equation, integrate, apply boundary conditions).

2. Axial force on a flux tube  
✓ Clear scenario and unique answer; no unit problems.  
× Requires only one step (∂U/∂z). Fails guideline 3.  
× Almost identical to the standard derivation of the Lorentz force; lacks originality.  
→ Enrich the physics so at least three operations are needed. Example: let B(z) vary slowly, or tilt the vortex by a small angle and ask for the component of the force along the tilt.  That forces (i) expressing U(z), (ii) differentiating, (iii) taking a projection.  
→ Otherwise drop the problem.

3. Magnus force by momentum-flux tensor  
✓ Involves three distinct steps (write Π, surface integral, far-field limit), gives a single symbolic answer, units fine.  
× Very close to the textbook Hall-Vinen derivation; marginal on “be unique.”  
→ Acceptable but consider adding a twist (e.g. finite core size cutoff or entrainment parameter) to avoid pure textbook overlap.

4. Shear-Alfvén–lattice dispersion

Evaluate them against these guidelines:
1. Model a Physical Scenario: Start from a real-world or idealized setup. 2. Target a Solvable Quantity: Ask for a clear symbolic expression of a physical variable (e.g., tension, acceleration, energy). 3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning: Ensure the question involves a sequence of physics laws, transformations, and derivations to reach the answer. 4. Avoid Redundancy: Exclude extraneous details or variables that do not impact the final solution. 5. Be Unique: Do not rephrase standard textbook problems; ensure originality and complexity. 6. Single solution: Expect a single symbolic expression, unambiguous, presented in LaTeX. Multiple equivalent algebraic forms are allowed. No equations or floating-point approximations. 7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing. 8. Avoid colloquial or ambiguous terminology. 9. Units must be consisten t; symbols should follow standard notation.10. Questions must not have multiple parts to answer, there should be only 1 solution to each quesion

Question-by-question remarks and fixes

Q1 Proton current profile  
✓ Good multi-step physics (entrainment + London equation + BCs).  
✗ P_p is defined but never used—delete or use it.  
✗ j_{pφ} is a mass-flux density; if you intend electric current, multiply by proton charge.  
✗ Mention that ρ_s and ε are uniform constants.  
Action: Remove P_p or work it into the derivation; rename j_{pφ}→ρ_s v_{pφ} “mass flux” or add the charge factor; drop the explicit (i)–(iii).

Q2 Lateral force on a tilted vortex  
✓ Clear physical quantity.  
✗ Only two true physics steps; add one more (e.g., expand U to O(α²) or verify that L cancels).  
✗ L appears in U but cancels—state that explicitly to avoid confusion.  
✗ The direction/sign of the force could be clearer: is it the force on the tip or per unit length?  
Action: Require, for instance, “(i) express U(α) to first order, (ii) relate α to δx, (iii) compute f_x.”  Explicitly state that the final answer is the magnitude of the lateral force per unit length.

Q3 Magnus force  
✓ Fully satisfies guidelines; no redundant variables.  
✗ Replace “By (i)… (ii)… (iii)…” with a brief directive: “Use the momentum-flux tensor and a cylindrical control surface to show that…”.  
✗ Specify that pressure p(r) is single-valued so its contribution cancels, for completeness.

Q4 Shear–Alfvén–lattice dispersion  
✓ Excellent blend of elasticity and MHD.  
✗ G_v enters only via c_v—consider defining c_v outright and dropping G_v.  
✗ Clarify that ξ(x,t) is the Lagrangian displacement and that ρ_s, B_0 are constants.  
✗ Remove the explicit enumeration of steps.

A straight neutron vortex of circulation κ ẑ lies in a neutron‐star core.  For r > ξ (the vortex‐core radius), the azimuthal velocity of the neutron superfluid is  
  v_{nφ}(r)=κ/(2πr).  
The superconducting proton fluid (uniform mass density ρ_s) is entrained so that its momentum per unit volume is  
  p_p=ρ_s\,(v_p−ε v_n),   with 0<ε<1  
and in the London approximation  
  ∇×(v_p+ε v_n)=0.  
Requiring that v_{pφ}(r→∞)=0 and that v_{pφ}(r=ξ) remain finite, combine the entrainment relation with the London condition, integrate in r, and impose these boundary conditions to show that the proton mass‐flux density  
  j_{pφ}(r)=ρ_s v_{pφ}(r)  
for r>ξ is  
  \displaystyle j_{pφ}(r)=ρ_s\,ε\,\frac{κ}{2πr}\Bigl(1-\frac{ξ}{r}\Bigr)\,.  

2. Lateral force on a slightly tilted flux‐carrying vortex  
A straight proton vortex of length L carries one flux quantum Φ=h/(2e) along its axis.  In a uniform external field B_0ẑ, its magnetic interaction energy is  
  U(α)=−(Φ B_0/μ_0)\,L cos α,  
where α≪1 is the small tilt from the z‐axis (so the top end is displaced by δx=L sin α≈L α).  (i) Expand U(α) to first order in α, (ii) relate δx to α, and (iii) compute the lateral force f_x=−dU/d(δx).  Show that, to leading order, the magnitude of the lateral force per unit length is  
  \displaystyle f_x=\frac{Φ\,B_0}{μ_0}\,.  

3. Transverse (Magnus) force via the momentum‐flux tensor  
A straight proton vortex carrying circulation κ ẑ moves with velocity v_L through a proton superfluid of uniform density ρ_s and far‐field velocity v_s.  The ideal‐fluid momentum‐flux tensor is  
  Π_{ij}=ρ_s v_{si} v_{sj}+p δ_{ij},  
where the pressure term integrates to zero around a cylindrical surface at radius r≫ξ.  By evaluating the surface integral F_i=∮Π_{ij} n_j dS on a cylinder coaxial with the vortex and then taking r→∞, derive the net transverse force per unit length and show  
  \displaystyle f_T=ρ_s\,κ\,\hat z\times\bigl(v_s-v_L\bigr)\,.  

4. Oblique shear–Alfvén–vortex‐lattice dispersion  
In a superconducting neutron‐star core the proton superfluid (density ρ_s) supports a uniform magnetic field B_0ẑ and a triangular vortex lattice of shear modulus G_v.  Define the Alfvén and lattice speeds  
  c_A=\frac{B_0}{\sqrt{μ_0 ρ_s}},  
  c_v=\sqrt{\frac{G_v}{ρ_s}}\,.  
Consider small transverse Lagrangian displacements ξ(x,t)=ξ_0 e^{i(k·x−ωt)} with |k|=k and k·ẑ=k cos θ.  By linearizing the ideal‐MHD induction equation, writing the elastic stress of the lattice, and combining them to eliminate the magnetic and elastic fields, derive the dispersion relation  
  \displaystyle ω^2=k^2\bigl(c_A^2\cos^2θ+c_v^2\sin^2θ\bigr)\,.

General remarks  
•  The physical set-ups, target quantities, and required reasoning depth are, overall, well chosen.  
•  The wording is, however, highly “walk-through”; you are telling the student exactly what intermediate operations to perform.  That violates guideline 3 (they should decide which laws/steps are needed) and guideline 10 (no multi-part prompts).  
•  Several items are textbook staples (e.g. the Magnus force), so guideline 5 (originality) is only marginally satisfied.  
•  Guideline 4 can be tightened by stripping symbols that never enter the final answer.  
•  Wherever you subdivide the problem with “(i)…(ii)…(iii)”, or write explicit directions such as “combine … integrate … impose”, you create de-facto sub-questions and risk multiple-answer grading conflicts. Re-cast each task as a single request for the final expression.  
•  Keep the hints implicit; remove algorithmic instructions.  
•  Make all symbols that survive to the answer appear in the stem; omit the rest.  

Specific comments  

Problem 1  
✓  Scenario and target are clear; multi-step derivation is unavoidable.  
×  You prescribe the full solution path; simply ask for j_{pφ}(r) under the stated physical conditions.  
×  The requirement “v_{pφ}(r=ξ) remain finite” is ambiguous; either state “regular at r=ξ” or give the boundary condition explicitly.  
✓  Units and notation are fine.  
Action: Shorten to  
“Using the London condition ∇×(v_p+εv_n)=0 and the entrainment relation p_p=ρ_s(v_p−εv_n), find the proton mass-flux density j_{pφ}(r) for ξ<r<∞ when v_{pφ}(∞)=0.”  

Problem 2  
✓  Physical content is good.  
×  (i)–(iii) break guideline 10.  
×  Writing U(α) already supplies the expansion; students barely do any physics.  
Action: pose one question:  
“Given U(α)=−(ΦB_0/μ_0)L cosα for a vortex tilted by a small angle α≪1, express the lateral force per unit length f_x in terms of Φ and B_0.”  
The student must still do the series expansion, geometry, and derivative, but you no longer spoon-feed the steps.  

Problem 3  
×  This is the canonical textbook derivation of the Magnus force and scores low on uniqueness.  
✓  Otherwise meets the guidelines.  
Action: add novelty; e.g., include a weak, uniform counterflow or a radial density gradient so the standard proof no longer copies verbatim from texts.  Keep the same final form in an appropriate limit so a unique answer still exists.  

Problem 4  
✓  Nice blend of MHD and lattice elasticity; multi-step reasoning is required.  
×  The stem again walks the student through the manipulations and hence partly answers itself.  
✓  Units, symbols, and single target expression all good.  
Action: Reduce guidance:  
“Derive the dispersion relation for small transverse plane waves in a superconducting proton lattice threaded by a uniform field B_0ẑ and characterised by shear modulus G_v.  Show that ω^2 = …”  

Minor editorial fixes  
•  “Units must be consisten t” → “Units must be consistent.”  
•  In Problem 2 replace “≈Lα” with “≈L α”.  
•  Remove commas after display equations unless grammatically needed.  

Summary of actionable improvements  
1.  Delete enumerated sub-parts and algorithmic hints; ask only for the final closed-form expression.  
2.  Trim or define every symbol that appears; drop unused ones.  
3.  Inject novelty into Problem 3 (and, to a lesser extent, 1 and 2) to distance them from standard textbook material.  
4.  Keep phrasing terse and formal; avoid “combine the entrainment relation with…”.  
5.  Double-check that only one mathematically equivalent answer set exists for each problem.

Below is a set of four original, university-level problems.  Each asks for a single, unambiguous symbolic result (to be given in LaTeX), involves multi-step reasoning, and is rooted in current issues of the Standard Model, neutrino physics, or electroweak radiative corrections.

1) Type-I Seesaw with One-Loop Gauge Correction  
“Consider a type-I seesaw model with a single heavy Majorana neutrino of mass \(M_{R}\) and a Dirac Yukawa coupling \(y\) to the Higgs doublet, which acquires a vacuum expectation value \(v\).  At tree level the light neutrino mass is \(m_{D}^{2}/M_{R}\), where \(m_{D}=y\,v\).  At one loop, SU(2)\(_L\) gauge boson exchange induces a correction  
\[
\Delta m = \frac{3\,g^{2}}{16\pi^{2}}\;\frac{m_{D}^{2}}{M_{R}}\;\ln\!\bigl(\Lambda/M_{R}\bigr),
\]  
with gauge coupling \(g\) and ultraviolet cutoff \(\Lambda\).  
Derive a single expression for the effective light neutrino mass \(m_{\nu}^{\rm eff}\) in terms of \(y\), \(v\), \(M_{R}\), \(g\), and \(\Lambda\).”

2) Higgs-Mass Fine-Tuning from the Top Quark Loop  
“In the Standard Model the dominant radiative correction to the Higgs boson mass-squared at high scale \(\Lambda\) comes from the top quark loop,  
\[
\Delta m_{H}^{2} \;=\; -\,\frac{3\,|y_{t}|^{2}}{8\pi^{2}}\;\Lambda^{2},
\]  
where \(y_{t}\) is the top Yukawa coupling.  If the renormalized (physical) Higgs mass-squared at scale \(\Lambda\) must be \(\bigl(m_{H}^{\rm phys}\bigr)^{2}\), determine the bare mass-squared \(m_{0}^{2}\) at scale \(\Lambda\) (in terms of \(m_{H}^{\rm phys}\), \(y_{t}\), and \(\Lambda\)) that exactly cancels the quadratic divergence.”

3) Oscillation Length of an Active–Sterile System in Matter  
“Consider two-flavor oscillations between an active neutrino \(\nu_{a}\) and a sterile neutrino \(\nu_{s}\) propagating through matter of constant potential \(V\).  In vacuum the mass‐square splitting is \(\Delta m^{2}\) and the mixing angle is \(\theta\).  In matter the effective mixing angle \(\theta_{m}\) obeys  
\[
\tan 2\theta_{m}
=\frac{\Delta m^{2}\,\sin2\theta}
{\Delta m^{2}\,\cos2\theta - 2\,E\,V}\,.
\]  
Define the matter‐corrected splitting \(\Delta m_{m}^{2} = \Delta m^{2}\sqrt{(\cos2\theta - 2EV/\Delta m^{2})^{2} + \sin^{2}2\theta}\).  Derive the oscillation length in matter  
\[
L_{m} \;=\;\frac{4\pi\,E}{\Delta m_{m}^{2}}
\]  
and express it fully in terms of \(E\), \(\Delta m^{2}\), \(\theta\), and \(V\).”

4) Running of the Weak Mixing Angle at One Loop  
“The SU(2)\(_L\) and U(1)\(_Y\) gauge couplings satisfy the one-loop RGEs  
\[
\frac{d g_{i}}{d\ln\mu}
=\frac{b_{i}}{16\pi^{2}}\,g_{i}^{3}\,, 
\quad b_{1}=\tfrac{41}{6},\;b_{2}=-\tfrac{19}{6}.
\]  
Define the weak mixing angle by \(\tan\theta_{W}(\mu)=g_{1}(\mu)/g_{2}(\mu)\).  Given initial values \(g_{1}(\mu_{0})\) and \(g_{2}(\mu_{0})\) at scale \(\mu_{0}\), derive a closed-form expression for \(\sin^{2}\theta_{W}(\mu)\) at arbitrary \(\mu>\mu_{0}\), in terms of \(g_{1}(\mu_{0})\), \(g_{2}(\mu_{0})\), \(b_{1,2}\), and \(\ln(\mu/\mu_{0})\).”

Overall remarks  
• The four prompts are thematically interesting and technically correct, but most of the requested “derivations’’ collapse to a one-line substitution because the key intermediate formulas are already handed to the student.  
• Because so much of the algebra is pre-supplied, the questions do not genuinely force multi-step reasoning (Guideline 3).  
• Minor wording and notation issues violate Guidelines 7–9.  
• No prompt states boundary conditions or domain restrictions (e.g., hierarchy \(m_D\ll M_R\)), which may lead to ambiguity in the final algebraic form (Guideline 6).  

Problem-by-problem critique and fixes

1) Type-I Seesaw with One-Loop Gauge Correction  
✔ Models a realistic scenario and targets a single symbol.  
✘ The student only has to write \(m_\nu^{\text{eff}}=m_D^{2}/M_R+\Delta m\); all ingredients are pre-given. Multi-step physics (e.g., loop integration, symmetry factors) is missing.  
✘ Tree-level expression uses \(m_D^2/M_R\) without stating \(m_D\ll M_R\).  
Actionable fixes  
• Remove the loop result and ask the student to compute it.  Supply only the relevant Feynman rule and ask for the leading-log piece, then ask for the sum.  
• Explicitly require the limit \(m_D\ll M_R\) to keep units and approximations clear.  

2) Higgs-Mass Fine-Tuning from the Top Loop  
✔ Single symbolic unknown \(m_0^2\).  
✘ Again, the calculation is trivial once \(\Delta m_H^2\) is provided; no multi-step reasoning.  
✘ “Exactly cancels the quadratic divergence’’ is colloquial (Guideline 8).  
Actionable fixes  
• Provide the bare Lagrangian and renormalized condition; ask the student to impose \(m_H^2(\mu)=m_H^{\rm phys}\) after renormalization, forcing them to write the counter-term and perform at least one renormalization condition step.  
• Re-phrase: “Determine the bare Higgs mass squared \(m_0^2(\Lambda)\) such that the renormalized mass at scale \(\Lambda\) equals \(m_H^{\rm phys}\).’’  

3) Oscillation Length of an Active–Sterile System in Matter  
✘ The desired final formula is already supplied; the student only needs to quote it.  
✘ Units for \(V\) (potential energy per neutrino) are not stated.  
Actionable fixes  
• Provide only the effective Hamiltonian, ask the student to diagonalize it and obtain both \(\Delta m_m^2\) and \(L_m\).  
• Specify that \(V\) has dimensions of energy, and state any relativistic limit assumptions (\(E\gg m_i\)).  

4) Running of the Weak Mixing Angle at One Loop  
✔ Conceptually rich and requires solving coupled RGEs.  
✘ Still, most students will see that the closed-form solution is simply the usual one-loop running; little physics reasoning is needed beyond integrating \(dg_i/g_i^3\).  
✘ Small notation inconsistency: \(b_{1,2}\) should be \(b_1,b_2\).  
Actionable fixes  
• Provide only the RGE for \(g_i\), not the value of \(b_i\), and ask students to derive \(\sin^2\theta_W(\mu)\) in terms of general \(b_1,b_2\).  They must integrate, solve for each coupling, then combine them.  
• State explicitly that \(\mu>\mu_0\) and neglect threshold effects.  

Formatting and phrasing tweaks for all problems  
• Spell out every symbol the first time it appears and keep notation consistent (e.g., use either \(m_\nu^{\text{eff}}\) or \(m_{\text{eff}}\), not both).  
• Remove conversational wording like “exactly cancels’’ or “dominant’’ unless quantified.  
• Check dimensional consistency after the final expression; mention any approximations (hierarchy limits, relativistic limit) that justify dropping sub-leading terms.  

In short: strip away the “answer-in-the-question’’ parts, add one or two genuine physics steps, and tighten notation and wording.

If the renormalized (physical) Higgs mass-squared at scale \(\Lambda\) must be \(\bigl(m_{H}^{\rm phys}\bigr)^{2}\), determine the bare mass-squared \(m_{0}^{2}\) at scale \(\Lambda\) (in terms of \(m_{H}^{\rm phys}\), \(y_{t}\), and \(\Lambda\)) that exactly cancels the quadratic divergence.”

3) Oscillation Length of an Active–Sterile System in Matter  
“Consider two-flavor oscillations between an active neutrino \(\nu_{a}\) and a sterile neutrino \(\nu_{s}\) propagating through matter of constant potential \(V\).  In vacuum the mass‐square splitting is \(\Delta m^{2}\) and the mixing angle is \(\theta\).  In matter the effective mixing angle \(\theta_{m}\) obeys  
\[
\tan 2\theta_{m}
=\frac{\Delta m^{2}\,\sin2\theta}
{\Delta m^{2}\,\cos2\theta - 2\,E\,V}\,.
\]  
Define the matter‐corrected splitting \(\Delta m_{m}^{2} = \Delta m^{2}\sqrt{(\cos2\theta - 2EV/\Delta m^{2})^{2} + \sin^{2}2\theta}\).  Derive the oscillation length in matter  
\[
L_{m} \;=\;\frac{4\pi\,E}{\Delta m_{m}^{2}}
\]  
and express it fully in terms of \(E\), \(\Delta m^{2}\), \(\theta\), and \(V\).”

4) Running of the Weak Mixing Angle at One Loop  
“The SU(2)\(_L\) and U(1)\(_Y\) gauge couplings satisfy the one-loop RGEs  
\[
\frac{d g_{i}}{d\ln\mu}
=\frac{b_{i}}{16\pi^{2}}\,g_{i}^{3}\,, 
\quad b_{1}=\tfrac{41}{6},\;b_{2}=-\tfrac{19}{6}.
\]  
Define the weak mixing angle by \(\tan\theta_{W}(\mu)=g_{1}(\mu)/g_{2}(\mu)\).  Given initial values \(g_{1}(\mu_{0})\) and \(g_{2}(\mu_{0})\) at scale \(\mu_{0}\), derive a closed-form expression for \(\sin^{2}\theta_{W}(\mu)\) at arbitrary \(\mu>\mu_{0}\), in terms of \(g_{1}(\mu_{0})\), \(g_{2}(\mu_{0})\), \(b_{1,2}\), and \(\ln(\mu/\mu_{0})\).”
Feedback:
Overall remarks  
• The four prompts are thematically interesting and technically correct, but most of the requested “derivations’’ collapse to a one-line substitution because the key intermediate formulas are already handed to the student.  
• Because so much of the algebra is pre-supplied, the questions do not genuinely force multi-step reasoning (Guideline 3).  
• Minor wording and notation issues violate Guidelines 7–9.  
• No prompt states boundary conditions or domain restrictions (e.g., hierarchy \(m_D\ll M_R\)), which may lead to ambiguity in the final algebraic form (Guideline 6).  

Problem-by-problem critique and fixes

1) Type-I Seesaw with One-Loop Gauge Correction  
✔ Models a realistic scenario and targets a single symbol.  
✘ The student only has to write \(m_\nu^{\text{eff}}=m_D^{2}/M_R+\Delta m\); all ingredients are pre-given. Multi-step physics (e.g., loop integration, symmetry factors) is missing.  
✘ Tree-level expression uses \(m_D^2/M_R\) without stating \(m_D\ll M_R\).  
Actionable fixes  
• Remove the loop result and ask the student to compute it.  Supply only the relevant Feynman rule and ask for the leading-log piece, then ask for the sum.  
• Explicitly require the limit \(m_D\ll M_R\) to keep units and approximations clear.  

2) Higgs-Mass Fine-Tuning from the Top Loop  
✔ Single symbolic unknown \(m_0^2\).  
✘ Again, the calculation is trivial once \(\Delta m_H^2\) is provided; no multi-step reasoning.  
✘ “Exactly cancels the quadratic divergence’’ is colloquial (Guideline 8).  
Actionable fixes  
• Provide the bare Lagrangian and renormalized condition; ask the student to impose \(m_H^2(\mu)=m_H^{\rm phys}\) after renormalization, forcing them to write the counter-term and perform at least one renormalization condition step.  
• Re-phrase: “Determine the bare Higgs mass squared \(m_0^2(\Lambda)\) such that the renormalized mass at scale \(\Lambda\) equals \(m_H^{\rm phys}\).’’  

3) Oscillation Length of an Active–Sterile System in Matter  
✘ The desired final formula is already supplied; the student only needs to quote it.  
✘ Units for \(V\) (potential energy per neutrino) are not stated.  
Actionable fixes  
• Provide only the effective Hamiltonian, ask the student to diagonalize it and obtain both \(\Delta m_m^2\) and \(L_m\).  
• Specify that \(V\) has dimensions of energy, and state any relativistic limit assumptions (\(E\gg m_i\)).  

4) Running of the Weak Mixing Angle at One Loop  
✔ Conceptually rich and requires solving coupled RGEs.  
✘ Still, most students will see that the closed-form solution is simply the usual one-loop running; little physics reasoning is needed beyond integrating \(dg_i/g_i^3\).  
✘ Small notation inconsistency: \(b_{1,2}\) should be \(b_1,b_2\).  
Actionable fixes  
• Provide only the RGE for \(g_i\), not the value of \(b_i\), and ask students to derive \(\sin^2\theta_W(\mu)\) in terms of general \(b_1,b_2\).  They must integrate, solve for each coupling, then combine them.  
• State explicitly that \(\mu>\mu_0\) and neglect threshold effects.  

Formatting and phrasing tweaks for all problems  
• Spell out every symbol the first time it appears and keep notation consistent (e.g., use either \(m_\nu^{\text{eff}}\) or \(m_{\text{eff}}\), not both).  
• Remove conversational wording like “exactly cancels’’ or “dominant’’ unless quantified.  
• Check dimensional consistency after the final expression; mention any approximations (hierarchy limits, relativistic limit) that justify dropping sub-leading terms.  

In short: strip away the “answer-in-the-question’’ parts, add one or two genuine physics steps, and tighten notation and wording.

Here is a revised set of four university-level problems.  In each case unnecessary “answer‐in‐the‐question’’ material has been removed, genuine multi-step physics is required, notation is spelled out up front, hierarchy or kinematic limits are stated, and no final formula is pre-supplied.

1) Type-I Seesaw: one-loop gauge correction  
Lagrangian (mass basis)  
  \[ 
    {\cal L}\supset -\,\overline{\nu_{L}}\,y\,\tilde H\,N_{R}
    \;-\;\tfrac12\,M_{R}\,\overline{N_{R}^{c}}\,N_{R}
    \;+\;\text{h.c.}
  \]  
Here \(\nu_{L}\) is the SM doublet neutrino, \(N_{R}\) a heavy Majorana state, \(y\) the Dirac Yukawa coupling, \(\tilde H=i\sigma_2 H^*\), and \(M_{R}\gg y\,v\).  The tree-level light mass is \(m_{\nu}^{(0)}=y^2v^2/M_{R}\).  The SU(2)\(_L\) gauge-boson Feynman rule coupling \(W\) to \(\nu_{L}\) is \(i\,(g/2)\,\bar\nu_{L}\gamma^\mu W_\mu^+\ell_{L}\) (and hermitian conjugate).  With a hard momentum cutoff \(\Lambda\gg M_{R}\):

  a) Draw and write the integral expression for the one-loop diagram in which a virtual \(W\) is exchanged between two \(\nu_{L}\) legs, closing onto the heavy \(N_{R}\) propagator.  Include symmetry factors.

  b) Evaluate the integral in the leading-log approximation (keep only terms \(\propto\ln(\Lambda/M_{R})\)).

  c) Sum tree and one-loop pieces to obtain the effective light neutrino mass  
     \[
       m_{\nu}^{\rm eff} \;=\; m_{\nu}^{(0)} \;+\;\Delta m_{\nu}\!,
     \]  
     giving your final answer in terms of \(y\), \(v\), \(M_{R}\), \(g\), and \(\Lambda\).

2) Higgs-mass renormalization and fine-tuning  
Bare Higgs sector (in dimensional regularization with UV cutoff \(\Lambda\)):  
  \[
    {\cal L}_{H}
    =|\partial_\mu H|^2 - m_0^2\,|H|^2 - \lambda\,|H|^4
    - y_t\,\bar t_{L} H\,t_{R} + \text{h.c.}
  \]  
Here \(m_0^2\) is the bare mass squared at scale \(\Lambda\), \(y_t\) the top Yukawa coupling, and after electroweak symmetry breaking \(\langle H\rangle=(0,\,v/\sqrt2)^T\).  Denote the physical Higgs mass at scale \(\Lambda\) by \((m_{H}^{\rm phys})^2=v^{-2}\,d^2V_{\rm eff}/d h^2\bigl|_{h=0}\).  In the limit \(\Lambda\gg m_t\):

  a) Compute the top-quark one-loop contribution \(\Delta\Pi(0)\) to the Higgs two-point function at zero external momentum, retaining only the leading \(\Lambda^2\) term.

  b) Impose the renormalization condition  
     \[
       m_{H}^{2}(\Lambda)\equiv m_0^2 + \Delta\Pi(0)
       = (m_{H}^{\rm phys})^2.
     \]

  c) Solve for \(m_0^2\) in terms of \(\Lambda\), \(y_t\), and \((m_{H}^{\rm phys})^2\).  

3) Active–sterile neutrino oscillations in matter  
In flavor basis \((\nu_a,\nu_s)\) the effective Hamiltonian for ultrarelativistic neutrinos (\(E\gg m_i\)) traversing constant-density matter is  
  \[
    H = \frac{1}{2E}\,U
    \begin{pmatrix}m_1^2&0\\0&m_2^2\end{pmatrix}
    U^\dagger + \begin{pmatrix}V&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix},
  \]  
where \(U=\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}\cos\theta&\sin\theta\\-\sin\theta&\cos\theta\end{smallmatrix}\bigr)\), \(\Delta m^2=m_2^2-m_1^2>0\), mixing angle \(\theta\), and matter potential \(V\) (an energy).  Assume \(V\) positive and constant.

  a) Diagonalize \(H\): find the matter mixing angle \(\theta_m\) from \(\tan2\theta_m\) and the eigenvalues \(E_{2}-E_{1}\).

  b) Show that the effective mass-squared splitting in matter is  
     \[
       \Delta m_m^2 
       = (E_{2}-E_{1})\,2E,
     \]  
     and express \(\Delta m_m^2\) in terms of \(\Delta m^2\), \(\theta\), \(E\), and \(V\).

  c) Using \(L_m = 2\pi/(E_{2}-E_{1})\), derive the full expression for the oscillation length  
     \[
       L_m = \frac{4\pi\,E}{\Delta m_m^2}
     \]  
     in terms of \(E\), \(\Delta m^2\), \(\theta\), and \(V\).

4) One-loop running of the weak mixing angle  
The two gauge couplings \(g_1\) (U(1)\(_Y\)) and \(g_2\) (SU(2)\(_L\)) obey at one loop  
  \[
    \frac{d g_i}{d t} = \frac{b_i}{16\pi^2}\;g_i^3,\qquad
    t\equiv\ln\mu,\quad i=1,2,
  \]  
with constants \(b_1\) and \(b_2\).  Define the weak mixing angle by  
  \(\tan\theta_W(\mu)=g_1(\mu)/g_2(\mu)\).  Neglect threshold effects and assume \(\mu>\mu_0\).

  a) Solve each RGE to express \(g_i(\mu)\) in terms of \(g_i(\mu_0)\), \(b_i\), and \(\ln(\mu/\mu_0)\).

  b) Form \(\tan\theta_W(\mu)\) and then \(\sin^2\theta_W(\mu)=\tan^2\theta_W/[1+\tan^2\theta_W]\).  Give a closed-form expression for \(\sin^2\theta_W(\mu)\) in terms of \(g_1(\mu_0)\), \(g_2(\mu_0)\), \(b_1\), \(b_2\), and \(\ln(\mu/\mu_0)\).

Evaluate them against these guidelines:
1. Model a Physical Scenario: Start from a real-world or idealized setup. 2. Target a Solvable Quantity: Ask for a clear symbolic expression of a physical variable (e.g., tension, acceleration, energy). 3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning: Ensure the question involves a sequence of physics laws, transformations, and derivations to reach the answer. 4. Avoid Redundancy: Exclude extraneous details or variables that do not impact the final solution. 5. Be Unique: Do not rephrase standard textbook problems; ensure originality and complexity. 6. Single solution: Expect a single symbolic expression, unambiguous, presented in LaTeX. Multiple equivalent algebraic forms are allowed. No equations or floating-point approximations. 7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing. 8. Avoid colloquial or ambiguous terminology. 9. Units must be consisten t; symbols should follow standard notation.10. Questions must not have multiple parts to answer, there should be only 1 solution to each quesion
Provide concise, actionable feedback on how to improve.

Global issues (apply to all four drafts)

• Guideline 10 is violated: every problem is broken into (a)/(b)/(c).  Keep the preparatory text, but end with ONE instruction that asks for ONE final symbolic result.  
• A single, explicit deliverable must be stated (Guideline 2 + 6).  Intermediate quantities may still be defined in the stem so students must derive them, but only the last line should be requested.  
• The stems contain pedagogical remarks (“include symmetry factors”, “hermitian conjugate” etc.) that do not affect the final answer ⇒ trim to meet Guideline 4.  
• Verify dimensional consistency: spell out what dimensional regularisation parameter or cutoff carries; make sure the requested final symbol (mass, length, angle, …) has clear units (Guideline 9).  
• Tighten prose (Guideline 7–8): delete commentary such as “tree-level”, “hard momentum”, “in the limit”.

Problem-specific remarks and fixes

1) Type-I seesaw  
– Keep the physical context, but ask only: “Derive and present the leading-log corrected light-neutrino mass mν (Λ) in terms of y, v, M_R, g, Λ.”  
– Omit the demand to “draw” the diagram; that cannot be answered symbolically.  
– Remove the explicit Feynman rule; simply say “include SU(2)_L gauge exchange”.

2) Higgs mass renormalisation  
– Collapse parts (a)–(c) into one question: “Compute the bare mass-squared m₀²(Λ) required to reproduce a physical Higgs mass m_H^{phys}, keeping only the O(Λ²) top-loop term.”  
– Discard “denote … at scale Λ”; that is implicit once the scale is named.  
– Mention the sign convention for Π(0) only inside the text, not as a separate task.

3) Active–sterile oscillation in matter  
– The only target should be L_m(E, Δm², θ, V).  Keep the Hamiltonian and definitions but remove separate requests for θ_m and Δm_m².  Students must still derive them internally.  
– Clarify that V has dimensions of energy so that L_m has dimensions of length.

4) One-loop running of θ_W  
– Combine (a)+(b): “Using the one-loop RGEs, obtain sin²θ_W(μ) in terms of g₁, g₂ at μ₀, the β-function coefficients b₁, b₂, and ln(μ/μ₀).”  
– Delete “neglect threshold effects and assume μ>μ₀”; this can be stated once in the introductory sentence.

After these edits each exercise

• models a concrete QFT scenario,  
• demands multi-step reasoning internally,  
• supplies only the minimum symbols required,  
• has one unambiguous symbolic answer.

Questions:
Here is a revised set of four university-level problems.  In each case unnecessary “answer‐in‐the‐question’’ material has been removed, genuine multi-step physics is required, notation is spelled out up front, hierarchy or kinematic limits are stated, and no final formula is pre-supplied.

1) Type-I Seesaw: one-loop gauge correction

    \;-\;\tfrac12\,M_{R}\,\overline{N_{R}^{c}}\,N_{R}
    \;+\;\text{h.c.}
  \]  
Here \(\nu_{L}\) is the SM doublet neutrino, \(N_{R}\) a heavy Majorana state, \(y\) the Dirac Yukawa coupling, \(\tilde H=i\sigma_2 H^*\), and \(M_{R}\gg y\,v\).  The tree-level light mass is \(m_{\nu}^{(0)}=y^2v^2/M_{R}\).  The SU(2)\(_L\) gauge-boson Feynman rule coupling \(W\) to \(\nu_{L}\) is \(i\,(g/2)\,\bar\nu_{L}\gamma^\mu W_\mu^+\ell_{L}\) (and hermitian conjugate).  With a hard momentum cutoff \(\Lambda\gg M_{R}\):

  a) Draw and write the integral expression for the one-loop diagram in which a virtual \(W\) is exchanged between two \(\nu_{L}\) legs, closing onto the heavy \(N_{R}\) propagator.  Include symmetry factors.

  b) Evaluate the integral in the leading-log approximation (keep only terms \(\propto\ln(\Lambda/M_{R})\)).

  c) Sum tree and one-loop pieces to obtain the effective light neutrino mass  
     \[
       m_{\nu}^{\rm eff} \;=\; m_{\nu}^{(0)} \;+\;\Delta m_{\nu}\!,
     \]  
     giving your final answer in terms of \(y\), \(v\), \(M_{R}\), \(g\), and \(\Lambda\).

2) Higgs-mass renormalization and fine-tuning  
Bare Higgs sector (in dimensional regularization with UV cutoff \(\Lambda\)):  
  \[
    {\cal L}_{H}
    =|\partial_\mu H|^2 - m_0^2\,|H|^2 - \lambda\,|H|^4
    - y_t\,\bar t_{L} H\,t_{R} + \text{h.c.}
  \]  
Here \(m_0^2\) is the bare mass squared at scale \(\Lambda\), \(y_t\) the top Yukawa coupling, and after electroweak symmetry breaking \(\langle H\rangle=(0,\,v/\sqrt2)^T\).  Denote the physical Higgs mass at scale \(\Lambda\) by \((m_{H}^{\rm phys})^2=v^{-2}\,d^2V_{\rm eff}/d h^2\bigl|_{h=0}\).  In the limit \(\Lambda\gg m_t\):

  a) Compute the top-quark one-loop contribution \(\Delta\Pi(0)\) to the Higgs two-point function at zero external momentum, retaining only the leading \(\Lambda^2\) term.

  b) Impose the renormalization condition

  c) Solve for \(m_0^2\) in terms of \(\Lambda\), \(y_t\), and \((m_{H}^{\rm phys})^2\).  

3) Active–sterile neutrino oscillations in matter  
In flavor basis \((\nu_a,\nu_s)\) the effective Hamiltonian for ultrarelativistic neutrinos (\(E\gg m_i\)) traversing constant-density matter is  
  \[
    H = \frac{1}{2E}\,U
    \begin{pmatrix}m_1^2&0\\0&m_2^2\end{pmatrix}

  a) Diagonalize \(H\): find the matter mixing angle \(\theta_m\) from \(\tan2\theta_m\) and the eigenvalues \(E_{2}-E_{1}\).

  b) Show that the effective mass-squared splitting in matter is  
     \[
       \Delta m_m^2 
       = (E_{2}-E_{1})\,2E,
     \]  
     and express \(\Delta m_m^2\) in terms of \(\Delta m^2\), \(\theta\), \(E\), and \(V\).

  c) Using \(L_m = 2\pi/(E_{2}-E_{1})\), derive the full expression for the oscillation length  
     \[

  \[
    \frac{d g_i}{d t} = \frac{b_i}{16\pi^2}\;g_i^3,\qquad

  \(\tan\theta_W(\mu)=g_1(\mu)/g_2(\mu)\).  Neglect threshold effects and assume \(\mu>\mu_0\).

  a) Solve each RGE to express \(g_i(\mu)\) in terms of \(g_i(\mu_0)\), \(b_i\), and \(\ln(\mu/\mu_0)\).

Global issues (apply to all four drafts)

• Guideline 10 is violated: every problem is broken into (a)/(b)/(c).  Keep the preparatory text, but end with ONE instruction that asks for ONE final symbolic result.  
• A single, explicit deliverable must be stated (Guideline 2 + 6).  Intermediate quantities may still be defined in the stem so students must derive them, but only the last line should be requested.  
• The stems contain pedagogical remarks (“include symmetry factors”, “hermitian conjugate” etc.) that do not affect the final answer ⇒ trim to meet Guideline 4.  
• Verify dimensional consistency: spell out what dimensional regularisation parameter or cutoff carries; make sure the requested final symbol (mass, length, angle, …) has clear units (Guideline 9).  
• Tighten prose (Guideline 7–8): delete commentary such as “tree-level”, “hard momentum”, “in the limit”.

Problem-specific remarks and fixes

1) Type-I seesaw  
– Keep the physical context, but ask only: “Derive and present the leading-log corrected light-neutrino mass mν (Λ) in terms of y, v, M_R, g, Λ.”  
– Omit the demand to “draw” the diagram; that cannot be answered symbolically.  
– Remove the explicit Feynman rule; simply say “include SU(2)_L gauge exchange”.

2) Higgs mass renormalisation  
– Collapse parts (a)–(c) into one question: “Compute the bare mass-squared m₀²(Λ) required to reproduce a physical Higgs mass m_H^{phys}, keeping only the O(Λ²) top-loop term.”  
– Discard “denote … at scale Λ”; that is implicit once the scale is named.  
– Mention the sign convention for Π(0) only inside the text, not as a separate task.

3) Active–sterile oscillation in matter  
– The only target should be L_m(E, Δm², θ, V).  Keep the Hamiltonian and definitions but remove separate requests for θ_m and Δm_m².  Students must still derive them internally.  
– Clarify that V has dimensions of energy so that L_m has dimensions of length.

4) One-loop running of θ_W  
– Combine (a)+(b): “Using the one-loop RGEs, obtain sin²θ_W(μ) in terms of g₁, g₂ at μ₀, the β-function coefficients b₁, b₂, and ln(μ/μ₀).”  
– Delete “neglect threshold effects and assume μ>μ₀”; this can be stated once in the introductory sentence.

After these edits each exercise

• models a concrete QFT scenario,  
• demands multi-step reasoning internally,  
• supplies only the minimum symbols required,  
• has one unambiguous symbolic answer.

Below is a revised set of four graduate‐level problems.  In each case the necessary Lagrangian or Hamiltonian is given, all notation is defined, and you are asked for one final symbolic result.

1) Type-I Seesaw with Gauge Correction  
The mass-basis Lagrangian for a single SM neutrino doublet ν_L and a heavy Majorana state N_R is  
  L ⊃ – ν̄_L y Ĥ N_R – ½ M_R N̄_R^c N_R + h.c.,  
with Ĥ = iσ₂H* and M_R ≫ y v.  The tree-level light mass is m_ν^(0)=y²v²/M_R.  Including the one-loop SU(2)_L gauge‐boson exchange between the two ν_L legs generates a correction Δm_ν ∝ g² ln(Λ/M_R).  

Derive and present the leading-logarithm–improved light‐neutrino mass  
   m_ν(Λ) = m_ν^(0) + Δm_ν

with vacuum expectation ⟨H⟩=(0,v/√2) and physical Higgs mass m_H^phys defined by the second derivative of the 1PI effective potential.  The top‐quark loop φ→tt̄→φ at zero external momentum gives Π(0) ≃ –(y_t²/8π²) Λ².  

Compute the bare mass‐squared m₀²(Λ) that reproduces m_H^phys after including Π(0), keeping only the O(Λ²) term.  Express m₀²(Λ) in terms of Λ, y_t, and (m_H^phys)².

3) Active–Sterile Neutrino Oscillations in Matter  
Ultrarelativistic (E≪m_i) two-state neutrinos (active ν_a, sterile ν_s) in constant matter potential V (an energy) obey  
  H = (1/2E) U diag(m₁²,m₂²) Uᵀ + diag(V,0),

Derive a closed-form expression for L_m(E, Δm², θ, V) in which dimensions manifestly give length.

4) One-Loop Running of the Weak Mixing Angle  
The U(1)_Y and SU(2)_L gauge couplings obey  
  dg_i/dt = (b_i/16π²) g_i³,   t=ln μ,   i=1,2.  
Define tan θ_W(μ)=g₁(μ)/g₂(μ) and sin²θ_W=tan²θ_W/(1+tan²θ_W).  

Solve these RGEs and derive sin²θ_W(μ) in closed form in terms of g₁(μ₀), g₂(μ₀), b₁, b₂, and ln(μ/μ₀).

Evaluate them against these guidelines:
1. Model a Physical Scenario: Start from a real-world or idealized setup. 2. Target a Solvable Quantity: Ask for a clear symbolic expression of a physical variable (e.g., tension, acceleration, energy). 3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning: Ensure the question involves a sequence of physics laws, transformations, and derivations to reach the answer. 4. Avoid Redundancy: Exclude extraneous details or variables that do not impact the final solution. 5. Be Unique: Do not rephrase standard textbook problems; ensure originality and complexity. 6. Single solution: Expect a single symbolic expression, unambiguous, presented in LaTeX. Multiple equivalent algebraic forms are allowed. No equations or floating-point approximations. 7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing. 8. Avoid colloquial or ambiguous terminology. 9. Units must be consisten t; symbols should follow standard notation.10. Questions must not have multiple parts to answer, there should be only 1 solution to each quesion
Provide concise, actionable feedback on how to improve.

Overall  
• Good graduate‐level scope and each prompt asks for a single symbolic result, but a few details violate the stated rubric.  
• Trim data that play no role in the target expression, make each set-up less “textbook-standard,” and sharpen wording.  
• Make sure every symbol appearing in the requested final answer has been defined and no others are introduced.  
• Check that the prompt itself does not bundle two separate results (guideline 10).  
• Keep units explicit wherever a dimensional quantity is requested.

────────────────────────────────────
1) Type-I Seesaw with Gauge Correction  
✓ Models a real scenario and the requested quantity is unique.  
× Very common textbook exercise; looks lifted from standard seesaw notes (guideline 5).  
× Ĥ=iσ₂H* and “h.c.” are irrelevant for the final expression (guideline 4).  
× “leading-logarithm-improved” is jargon; specify “keep only the O(g²lnΛ) term” to be unambiguous (guideline 8).  
Actionable fix  
• Delete Ĥ=iσ₂H* and “h.c.”; simply state the mass Lagrangian.  
• Phrase request as: “Give m_ν(Λ)=… accurate to O(g²ln(Λ/M_R)).”  
• Introduce a non-standard twist (e.g. include hypercharge mixing or two generations) to satisfy originality.  

────────────────────────────────────
2) Higgs-mass Renormalization  
✓ Clear target: m₀²(Λ).  
× λ, the gauge kinetic term |∂μH|², and ⟨H⟩ are unused (guideline 4).  
× This is almost verbatim from the fine-tuning paragraph in many texts (guideline 5).  
× “Compute … keeping only the O(Λ²) term” already implies dropping ln Λ pieces—state that explicitly.  
Actionable fix  
• Remove λ and the VEV line unless the answer contains v.  
• Recast the set-up: make the cutoff scheme explicit, e.g. “in a sharp momentum cutoff.”  
• For novelty, ask for m₀² including a fictitious vectorlike quark with coupling y_Q.  

────────────────────────────────────
3) Active–Sterile Oscillations  
✓ Requires diagonalizing a 2×2 Hamiltonian (multi-step reasoning).  
× Standard MSW formula with V_s=0; not unique.  
× Units may confuse: H is energy, but you define L_m=2π/(E₂–E₁) with no ħ or c. Clarify unit conventions (guideline 9).  
× The phrase “Ultrarelativistic (E≪m_i)” is inverted; should be E≫m_i.  
Actionable fix  
• State explicitly “We work in natural units ħ=c=1.”  
• Correct the ultrarelativistic condition.  
• Introduce a twist, e.g. a non-zero sterile potential V_s, so the result is less standard.  

────────────────────────────────────
4) One-Loop Running of sin²θ_W  
✓ Clean mathematical task, unambiguous end product.  
× g₁, g₂ are standard; but b_i values are not used—either supply them or say “leave b_i symbolic.”  
× The problem is again straight from most QFT lecture notes (guideline 5).  
× “Solve these RGEs and derive …” could be split into two tasks (guideline 10).  
Actionable fix  
• Supply explicit b₁, b₂ for a specified particle content or ask for the symbolic answer only.  
• Drop the intermediate “Solve…” clause; directly ask: “Derive sin²θ_W(μ)=… .”  
• Add originality: e.g. include an extra SU(2) triplet that alters b₂.  

────────────────────────────────────
Summary of global edits  
1. Strip any symbol, constant, or sentence not feeding the final formula.  
2. Clarify units once (“natural units” or retain ħ,c).  
3. Replace textbook‐standard parameters or add a small, novel twist to each physical set-up.  
4. Ensure the prompt demands exactly one symbolic output and states the required precision (e.g. “to leading log”).

Questions:
Below is a revised set of four graduate‐level problems.  In each case the necessary Lagrangian or Hamiltonian is given, all notation is defined, and you are asked for one final symbolic result.

1) Type-I Seesaw with Gauge Correction  
The mass-basis Lagrangian for a single SM neutrino doublet ν_L and a heavy Majorana state N_R is  
  L ⊃ – ν̄_L y Ĥ N_R – ½ M_R N̄_R^c N_R + h.c.,  
with Ĥ = iσ₂H* and M_R ≫ y v.  The tree-level light mass is m_ν^(0)=y²v²/M_R.  Including the one-loop SU(2)_L gauge‐boson exchange between the two ν_L legs generates a correction Δm_ν ∝ g² ln(Λ/M_R).  

Derive and present the leading-logarithm–improved light‐neutrino mass  
   m_ν(Λ) = m_ν^(0) + Δm_ν  
in terms of y, v, M_R, g, and the UV cutoff Λ.

2) Higgs-mass Renormalization and Fine-Tuning  
At scale Λ the bare Higgs Lagrangian is  
  L_H = |∂μH|² – m₀² |H|² – λ |H|⁴ – y_t t̄_L H t_R + h.c.,  
with vacuum expectation ⟨H⟩=(0,v/√2) and physical Higgs mass m_H^phys defined by the second derivative of the 1PI effective potential.  The top‐quark loop φ→tt̄→φ at zero external momentum gives Π(0) ≃ –(y_t²/8π²) Λ².  

Compute the bare mass‐squared m₀²(Λ) that reproduces m_H^phys after including Π(0), keeping only the O(Λ²) term.  Express m₀²(Λ) in terms of Λ, y_t, and (m_H^phys)².

3) Active–Sterile Neutrino Oscillations in Matter  
Ultrarelativistic (E≪m_i) two-state neutrinos (active ν_a, sterile ν_s) in constant matter potential V (an energy) obey  
  H = (1/2E) U diag(m₁²,m₂²) Uᵀ + diag(V,0),  
with U=[[cosθ, sinθ], [–sinθ, cosθ]] and Δm²=m₂²–m₁².  The oscillation length in matter is L_m=2π/(E₂–E₁), where E₂–E₁ is the eigenvalue splitting of H.  

Derive a closed-form expression for L_m(E, Δm², θ, V) in which dimensions manifestly give length.

4) One-Loop Running of the Weak Mixing Angle  
The U(1)_Y and SU(2)_L gauge couplings obey  
  dg_i/dt = (b_i/16π²) g_i³,   t=ln μ,   i=1,2.  
Define tan θ_W(μ)=g₁(μ)/g₂(μ) and sin²θ_W=tan²θ_W/(1+tan²θ_W).  

Solve these RGEs and derive sin²θ_W(μ) in closed form in terms of g₁(μ₀), g₂(μ₀), b₁, b₂, and ln(μ/μ₀).

Global observations
•  All four items satisfy “natural-units” and give a clear target symbol, but they vary in how well they exploit the other guidelines.  
•  Every stem already quotes the desired answer (or something algebraically identical).  This makes the derivation largely “prove what I just told you;” the pedagogical value is weakened and the problem risks becoming either trivial or circular.  
•  Phrasing is mostly rigorous, yet several superfluous phrases and letters remain (e.g. restating SU(2)L, specifying “sharp cut-off” twice, etc.).  
•  Question 2 is essentially one algebraic line, violating the “force multi-step reasoning” criterion.  
•  Questions 1, 3, 4 strongly resemble standard textbook or review-article examples; some extra twist is needed for genuine originality.

Problem-by-problem feedback

1)  Type-I seesaw with gauge correction  
   − The stem already furnishes the exact structure of the correction you later ask the student to derive; conceal either the coefficient or the logarithmic structure so that the student must obtain it.  
   − Remove “of order …” once you switch to the exact requested expression.  
   − The phrase “one‐loop W and B exchange” is enough; deleting “between the two νL legs” shortens without loss.  
   − M≫yv is irrelevant for the final formula—omit or fold into a parenthetical remark.  
   − Consider also asking for the renormalised coupling y(Λ) to add an extra step (RG plus matching).

2)  Higgs-mass renormalisation with a vectorlike quark  
   − As written, m0²=mH²−Π(0) is immediate; only one arithmetic step is needed, so it violates Guideline 3.  
   − Make the task multi-step: e.g. ask for m0²(Λ) after both quadratic and logarithmic divergences, or impose a renormalisation condition at μ≠0.  
   − Delete “In a sharp cut-off Λ,” (it is already implied by Π(0)).  
   − The word “physical” can be dropped once mH is defined.  
   − Clarify whether colour factors are absorbed in y; otherwise 3→Nc may confuse.  

3)  Active–sterile oscillations with two potentials  
   − Virtually identical to standard MSW derivations; add novelty (e.g. CP phase, non-standard dispersion, or energy-dependent potential) to satisfy “Be Unique.”  
   − Remove “Ensure your result has dimensions of length” (dimensional analysis is implicit).  
   − The definition of Δm² could be placed with other symbols to streamline the stem.  
   − Check sign conventions: Uᵀ vs U†—specify once and avoid possible ambiguity.

4)  One-loop running of sin²θW with an SU(2)L triplet  
   − A classic textbook exercise; originality could be injected by, say, including threshold matching at the triplet mass or letting b1,b2 switch values above that scale.  
   − Mention that gauge beta functions are one-loop only; otherwise readers may wonder whether higher-loop terms are neglected deliberately.  
   − Remove “Define tanθW=… and sin²θW≡…”—these are universally known; keeping just sin²θW(μ)=g1²/(g1²+g2²) is sufficient.  
   − Specify μ₀ once; discard the second appearance to tighten wording.

Actionable summary
1.  Hide or partly obscure the final answer so the student truly derives it.  
2.  Increase the number of logical steps required, especially in Problem 2.  
3.  Trim redundant definitions, qualifiers, and restatements.  
4.  Inject an element that goes beyond standard textbook material (thresholds, CP phases, etc.) to meet the “Be Unique” guideline.  
5.  Keep symbol lists minimal and avoid symbols that never enter the requested expression.

Below is a set of five original, university-level problems.  Each asks for a single symbolic result (to be given in LaTeX); multi-step reasoning is required in each case.

1) Beam‐deflection of antihydrogen  
Consider a nonrelativistic beam of antihydrogen atoms, each of rest mass \(m\) and kinetic energy \(E\), emitted horizontally and traveling a distance \(L\) in a uniform downward gravitational field \(g\).  
   Determine the vertical deflection \(\Delta y\) of the beam at the detector in terms of \(m\), \(E\), \(L\), and \(g\).

2) Gravitational phase shift in an interferometer  
In a Mach–Zehnder interferometer for antihydrogen, the two arms run horizontally over length \(L\) and are displaced vertically by \(\Delta h\).  Atoms of mass \(m\) and momentum \(p\) traverse the arms under uniform gravity \(g\).

General remarks for the whole set  
• All five prompts are concise and professionally phrased, but several violate the rubric in subtle ways.  
• The most frequent issues are (a) inclusion of symbols that cancel out or never enter the answer, (b) insufficient demand for genuine multi-step reasoning, and (c) ambiguity about what constitutes “the” final expression.  
• Check every variable: if it disappears from the final result, strike it from the statement.  
• State explicitly that the final answer must be given “in its simplest symbolic form” to enforce a unique output.

Item-by-item critique

1) Beam-deflection of antihydrogen  
✓ Realistic set-up; ✓ clear target (Δy); ✓ requires several steps (kinetic energy → speed → flight time → vertical drop).  
✗ The mass m cancels, so including it violates guideline 4. Either remove m from the list of required symbols or reformulate the question so that m remains.  
Action: “Determine Δy in terms of E, L and g.”

2) Gravitational phase shift in an interferometer  
✓ Modelling and multi-step reasoning are appropriate.  
✗ Redundancy: both m and p are listed although p = m v; only one is needed. Decide which you want to keep.  
✗ Potential ambiguity: readers may wonder whether the two arms have identical lengths and velocities; make this explicit.  
Action: “Atoms of mass m (momentum p = m v) traverse two equal-length horizontal arms L …”

3) Equilibrium height in a magnetic trap  
✓ Interesting, non-standard scenario; ✓ symbolic target.  
✗ B0 never appears in the answer (violates guideline 4).  
✗ Only one algebraic step is needed (μB''z = ηm0g), so the “multi-step” requirement is only marginally satisfied. Consider adding a preliminary step (e.g., ask first for the magnetic-potential energy and then the force).  
Action: Delete B0 and/or split the task into energy → force → equilibrium.

4) Scattering of “gravitationally charged” particles  
✗ The prompt merely asks students to “show that θ is a function of …” without demanding the explicit expression. This leaves the solution non-unique (fails guideline 6) and allows a one-sentence answer.  
✗ Phrasing “show that” sounds open-ended; re-state as “Derive the small-angle scattering formula  
 θ = 2Gm(ξ1ξ2)/(bv²) (in the small-angle limit).”  
✓ Otherwise original and multi-step (impact parameter → Rutherford‐type scattering).

5) Curvature-induced correction to antiparticle mass  
✗ Only one algebraic step (m_g = m_0 + δm); does not require physics reasoning.  
✗ Essentially a definition, not a derivation; fails guideline 3.  
Action: Either expand the question (e.g., require showing how the phase of a propagator leads to δm) or drop it and replace with a problem that genuinely mixes general relativity with quantum mechanics.

Summary of actionable changes  
• Remove or justify redundant symbols (m in Q1; B0 in Q3; duplicate m/p in Q2).  
• Rephrase Q4 so that a single, explicit θ expression is required.  
• Replace or deepen Q5 to mandate multi-step physics reasoning.  
• Where needed, add clarifying phrases to guarantee a single final symbolic answer.

Detailed item-by-item critique and fixes

Q1 Beam-deflection of antihydrogen  
✓ Scenario and target are clear.  
✗ Mass m is indispensable (Δy ∝ m/E). With only E, L, g the expression is dimensionally wrong.  
✗ One-line kinematics gives Δy, so “multi-step reasoning” is weak.  
Actionable fixes  
•  Introduce the mass explicitly and/or ask for the transit time as an intermediate quantity to force more steps.  
•  Add a subtle twist (e.g. include a weak magnetic gradient) to raise the level of originality.

Q2 Gravitational phase shift in a Mach–Zehnder interferometer  
✓ Physical model is well defined.  
✗ Keeping both m and p is redundant once v=p/m has been introduced; decide on one set of variables.  
✗ Derivation is essentially a single integration; consider adding path-length mismatches or a variable traversal speed to require more steps.  
Actionable fixes  
•  Specify whether both arms are truly equal in length in the lab frame or only in proper time (special-relativistic refinement).  
•  Remove either m or p from the list of permitted symbols.

Q3 Equilibrium height in a magnetic trap  
✓ Interesting context.  
✗ Two separate sub-questions (a) and (b) violate the “single-solution” rule.  
✗ m₀, m_g, and η are all defined although only η and m₀ appear in the final z_eq.  
Actionable fixes  
•  Combine the steps into one statement: “Starting from the harmonic expansion of the magnetic potential U_mag(z)=… derive the equilibrium height z_eq …”.  
•  Delete unneeded symbols or show why they matter (e.g. explicitly allow m_g to differ from m₀ in the final answer).

Q4 Small-angle scattering with ‘gravitational charge’  
✓ Nice twist on Rutherford.  
✗ The target formula is printed in the stem, so nothing is left to solve.  
✗ “Show every step” contradicts “single symbolic result” and invites overly long work.  
✗ Almost identical to the textbook derivation of Coulomb scattering ⇒ not original.  
Actionable fixes  
•  Remove the displayed answer; ask, for example, for the impact-parameter dependence of the differential cross-section, or include a screening length to make the force Yukawa-like.  
•  Drop “show every step”; instead, “Derive and give the leading-order small-angle expression for θ in LaTeX.”

Q5 Quantum gravitational bound states (“quantum bouncer”)  
✓ Recognised physical system.  
✗ The full final energy formula is already provided; only a restatement is required.  
✗ Standard textbook problem, so not unique.  
✗ Includes an implicit two-part request (“derive the quantisation condition and hence…”).  
Actionable fixes  
•  Remove the explicit answer; perhaps ask for the spacing ΔE_n−ΔE_{n−1} or the semiclassical limit.  
•  Phrase as one task: “Show that the stationary energies satisfy … and give E_n in terms of …”.  
•  Add a perturbing magnetic gradient or finite mirror height to depart from the textbook case.

Global stylistic/structural recommendations  
1.  Delete any provided target expressions; they nullify the assessment value.  
2.  Ensure each problem yields exactly one final formula and is stated in a single sentence after the scenario.  
3.  Double-check dimensional consistency before removing variables.  
4.  To heighten uniqueness, incorporate realistic antihydrogen‐specific details (e.g. charge-exchange loss rates, field-ionisation thresholds).  
5.  Replace imperative phrases like “Show every step” with “Derive … and present the final result as …”.

Questions:
Below is a revised set of five university‐level problems.  In each case you are asked for a single, fully explicit symbolic result (to be given in LaTeX), in its simplest form.  Genuine multi‐step physics or mathematical reasoning is required, and each answer must be a unique final formula.

1) Beam‐deflection of antihydrogen  
A nonrelativistic beam of antihydrogen atoms is emitted horizontally with kinetic energy \(E\) and travels a horizontal distance \(L\) through a uniform gravitational field \(g\).  
   Derive the vertical deflection \(\Delta y\) at the detector in its simplest symbolic form, expressed only in terms of \(E\), \(L\), and \(g\).

2) Gravitational phase shift in a Mach–Zehnder interferometer  
Antihydrogen atoms of mass \(m\) and momentum \(p\) traverse two equal‐length horizontal arms, each of length \(L\), which are vertically separated by \(\Delta h\) in a uniform gravitational field \(g\).  Assume the atoms move at constant speed in both arms.  
   Derive the gravity‐induced phase difference \(\Delta\phi\) between the two paths, in its simplest form, using only \(m\), \(g\), \(\Delta h\), \(L\), \(p\), and \(\hbar\).

3) Equilibrium height in a magnetic trap  
An antihydrogen atom has rest mass \(m_0\) and gravitational mass \(m_g=\eta\,m_0\).  It is confined along the vertical \(z\)-axis by a magnetic field whose second derivative at \(z=0\) is \(B''\), and whose magnetic moment \(\mu\) remains antiparallel to \(\mathbf B\).  Gravity acts downward with acceleration \(g\).  
   a) Write the atom’s magnetic potential energy \(U_{\rm mag}(z)\) to second order in \(z\).  
   b) From \(U_{\rm mag}(z)\) and the gravitational potential, derive the total force and then solve for the equilibrium height \(z_{\rm eq}\).  
   Give your final result for \(z_{\rm eq}\) in its simplest symbolic form, in terms of \(\eta\), \(m_0\), \(g\), \(\mu\), and \(B''\).

4) Small‐angle scattering of “gravitationally charged” particles  
Two neutral, structureless particles each of mass \(m\) carry “gravitational charges” \(q_{g1}=\xi_1\,m\) and \(q_{g2}=\xi_2\,m\).  They scatter nonrelativistically with relative speed \(v\) and impact parameter \(b\), interacting via  
\[
   F(r)\;=\;G\,\frac{q_{g1}\,q_{g2}}{r^2}\,.
\]  
   By analogy with Rutherford scattering, derive the small‐angle deflection  
\[
   \theta \;\approx\; \frac{2\,G\,m\,\xi_1\,\xi_2}{b\,v^2}\,.
\]  
   Show every step and present the final expression for \(\theta\) in its simplest symbolic form.

5) Quantum gravitational bound states (“quantum bouncer”)  
An antihydrogen atom of mass \(m\) moves in the vertical potential  
\[
   V(z)=
   \begin{cases}
     mg\,z\,, & z>0,\\
     +\infty\,, & z\le0,
   \end{cases}
\]  
where \(g\) is the acceleration of gravity.  The time‐independent Schrödinger equation admits discrete energy levels \(E_n\).  
   Derive the quantization condition for \(E_n\) in terms of \(m\), \(g\), \(\hbar\), and the \(n\)th zero \(a_n\) of the Airy function, and hence write  
\[
   E_n \;=\; \bigl(\tfrac{\hbar^2\,m^{1/3}\,g^{2/3}}{2^{2/3}}\bigr)\,a_n
\]  
in its simplest symbolic form.  Show all steps leading from the Schrödinger equation to this result.

Overall remarks (apply to all five items)

• Strip away meta-instructions (“Below is a revised set…”, “you are asked…”, etc.). The stem should describe only the physical situation and the quantity to be found (Guidelines 1, 7).

• State every modelling assumption explicitly (e.g. constant horizontal speed, Born approximation, WKB, small deflection). Ambiguity about which approximation to use leads to more than one legitimate answer (violates Guideline 10).

• Eliminate symbols that will never appear in the final result (Guideline 4).

• Use a single symbol for each physical mass: if gravitational and inertial mass differ, keep both; if not, omit the redundant one.

• Units are fine, but watch “rest mass m” versus “mass m” versus “m₀”.

• Each stem already demands multi-step reasoning and a single symbolic formula, so they satisfy Guidelines 2, 3 and 6.

Item-by-item suggestions

1. Beam deflection  
  – Say explicitly that the horizontal velocity is constant and obtained from E = ½ mv².  
  – You do not need the word “total”; simply ask for “the vertical deflection Δy at the detector”.  
  – Clarify that the magnetic gradient is uniform over the distance L.  

2. Gravitational phase shift  
  – Specify that the atomic speed v is the same along both arms (i.e. neglect gravitational acceleration along the arms). Otherwise more than one phase formula is defensible.  
  – Make it clear that δL ≪ L and Δh ≪ L, or remove these caveats if not required.  
  – The present wording meets all other guidelines.

3. Equilibrium height in a magnetic trap  
  – U₀ is a useless constant; omit it (Guideline 4).  
  – “Rest mass m₀” is enough; do not re-introduce m_g once you have written m_g = η m₀.  
  – State that B″ > 0 so the equilibrium is stable.

   Suggested cleaner stem:  
     “An antihydrogen atom of rest mass m₀ experiences a quadratic magnetic potential U_mag(z)=½ μ B″ z² and a gravitational potential η m₀ g z. Find the equilibrium height z_eq in terms of η, m₀, g, μ, and B″.”

4. Yukawa-screened scattering  
  – Declare the approximation you want (e.g. “Use the first Born approximation and keep only the leading term for θ ≪ 1”).  
  – You do not need to define two identical masses m if the masses are equal; one symbol suffices.  
  – Using “gravitational charge” is original, but briefly relate it to the potential to avoid confusion.

5. Large-n spacing of the quantum bouncer  
  – State the required method or limit: “Using the WKB approximation in the limit n ≫ 1, derive …”.  
  – Replace “g_eff = g + β/m” by defining g_eff once and thereafter use only that symbol; β then becomes redundant in the answer (Guideline 4).  
  – Confirm the mirror is perfectly reflecting and located at z = 0.

If these adjustments are made, all five problems will meet the stated guidelines while remaining novel and mathematically substantive.

A collimated beam of antihydrogen atoms of inertial mass m is emitted horizontally with kinetic energy E and traverses a region of length L in which it experiences a uniform downward gravitational acceleration g and a uniform upward magnetic force F_m=μ (dB/dy).  Assume the horizontal speed is v=√(2E/m) (so that the horizontal motion is unperturbed) and that the vertical deflection is small.  Derive the vertical deflection Δy at the end of the region in terms of m, E, L, g, μ, and dB/dy.

2) Gravitational phase shift in a Mach–Zehnder interferometer  
Antihydrogen atoms of mass m travel at constant speed v along the two horizontal arms of a Mach–Zehnder interferometer.  The upper arm has length L+δL, the lower arm length L−δL, and the two arms lie at vertical separation Δh in a uniform gravitational field g.  Neglect any change of speed due to gravity along each arm.  Derive the gravitationally induced phase difference Δφ between the two paths in terms of m, g, Δh, L, δL, v, and ℏ.

3) Equilibrium height in a quadratic magnetic trap  
An antihydrogen atom of mass m₀ experiences a magnetic potential  
 U_mag(z)=½ μ B″ z²  (with B″>0)  
and a gravitational potential  
 U_grav(z)=η m₀ g z.  
Find the equilibrium height z_eq (the value of z at which d [U_mag+U_grav]/dz=0) in terms of η, m₀, g, μ, and B″.

4) Small‐angle differential cross section for Yukawa‐screened gravity  
Two identical neutral particles of mass m carry “gravitational charges” q_{g1}=ξ₁ m and q_{g2}=ξ₂ m, interacting via the Yukawa‐screened potential  
 V(r)=−G ξ₁ m · ξ₂ m e^(−r/λ)/r.  
Using the first Born approximation and keeping only the leading term for scattering angles θ≪1, derive the differential cross section dσ/dΩ as a function of m, v, G, ξ₁, ξ₂, λ, and θ.

5) Asymptotic level spacing of the gravitational quantum bouncer  
An antihydrogen atom of mass m bounces above a perfectly reflecting mirror at z=0 under a constant effective acceleration g_eff.  The time‐independent Schrödinger equation admits bound states E_n (n=1,2,3,…).  Using the WKB approximation in the limit n≫1, derive the asymptotic spacing

Overall remarks  
• All five prompts are reasonably well-posed and use standard notation, but as a batch they violate Guideline 10 (“one question, one answer”).  Submit each as a separate item.  
• State every symbol that will survive to the final answer; otherwise leave it out of the “givens” list.  
• Make sure each problem really needs more than one quick algebraic step (Guideline 3).  
• Remove narrative filler (Guideline 7) and any quantity that cancels out (Guideline 4).  
• Check that ℏ, μ₀, etc., appear both in the statement and in the requested answer set.  
• Tighten phrasing to a single commanding sentence and place all assumptions in parenthetical clauses.

Problem-specific comments  

1) Beam deflection in uniform gravity and magnetic gradient  
✓ Good real-world scenario; Δy is unambiguously defined.  
Δ  “Assume the horizontal speed is …” can be shortened to “Treat v=√(2E/m) as constant.”  
Δ  F_m is introduced but m already appears in the final answer, so the phrase “of inertial mass m” is redundant.  
Δ  Consider deleting “collimated” (does not affect the derivation).  
→ Minor edits only.

2) Gravitational phase shift in a Mach–Zehnder interferometer  
✓ Requires several steps (path integrals, action difference).  
Δ  δL is unrelated to the gravitational contribution; it belongs to the kinematic phase.  Either (i) ask only for the gravitational part (drop δL) or (ii) ask for the total phase (keep δL but change the target variable accordingly).  
Δ  Phrase “Neglect any change of speed due to gravity” can be condensed to “Treat v as constant.”  
→ Clarify what portion of the phase is required and keep only the necessary symbols.

3) Equilibrium height in a quadratic magnetic trap  
✗ Too trivial: one derivative and one algebraic step violate Guideline 3.  
✗ B″>0 is already implied by the form of the potential; delete that clause.  
→ Enrich the task (e.g., ask for the small-oscillation frequency about z_eq or include anharmonic terms), or drop the question.

4) Small-angle differential cross section for Yukawa-screened gravity  
✓ Interesting, original context.  
✗ ℏ is unavoidable in the Born amplitude but is not listed among the allowed symbols—add it.  
✗ “Keeping only the leading term” is vague—specify an expansion order, e.g., O(θ⁻⁴).  
✗ Give the incident momentum k explicitly so the student knows whether to write k or mv/ℏ.  
→ List ℏ, define k, and state the desired small-angle approximation precisely.

5) Asymptotic level spacing of the gravitational quantum bouncer  
✓ Multi-step (WKB turning point, Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization, differentiation).  
Δ  Replace the narrative sentence with a concise imperative: “Using the WKB approximation for n≫1, derive the asymptotic spacing…”  
→ Acceptable after minor tightening.

Template for improved wording (example for Q1)  
“An antihydrogen atom of mass m travels horizontally at constant speed v=√(2E/m) through a region of length L where it experiences a uniform downward gravitational acceleration g and an upward magnetic force F_y = μ(dB/dy).  Assuming |Δy|≪L, derive the vertical deflection Δy at the exit in terms of m, E, L, g, μ, and dB/dy.”

Implement analogous tightening and symbol curation for the remaining problems to satisfy all ten guidelines.

General observations  
• Scope & Originality (Guidelines 1, 5):  All five problems are genuinely beyond textbook level and refer to current research topics—good.  
• Single target quantity (Guidelines 2, 10):  Each item ultimately asks for one formula.  
• Conciseness & rigour (Guidelines 7, 8, 9):  Wording is mostly technical; symbols are defined.  
• Multi-step demand (Guideline 3):  Several items can be solved in one line once the prompt has already placed the key equation on the page; they do not really “force” a derivation.  
• Redundancy (Guideline 4):  Some statements carry parameters that never affect the requested answer.  
• Ambiguity / non-uniqueness:  A few questions allow many algebraically equivalent answers or have branch ambiguities.

Detailed per item

1) UV/IR Mixing  
• The step Σ(p)=… is already given, and δm²(p)=Σ(p) is written in the prompt itself; nothing remains to derive.  
• No physical law needs to be applied; therefore it violates Guideline 3.  
• Extraneous variable g appears both in the formula and the request, so that is fine, but θ^{μν} is in the definition yet cancels out in the asked result—could be confusing.

Fix: Ask instead for the full one-loop self-energy starting from the Feynman integral with a cutoff, or for the small-p asymptotics including the non-planar piece; then the student must perform momentum integration and dimensional analysis.

2) Relaxion Stopping Condition  
• Once dV/dφ=0 is written, φ_stop is obtained by a single inversion: φ_stop = f arcsin(g Λ³ f/Λ_b⁴)+2πn f.  
• Multiple branches (n∈ℤ) create non-uniqueness, violating the “single solution” spirit.  
• No multi-step derivation required.

Fix: Pose a specific domain (e.g. 0 < φ_stop < π f) and require the consistency condition g Λ³ < Λ_b⁴/f to be shown, or embed the stopping condition inside a rolling-friction balance to add steps.

3) Composite-Higgs HWW coupling  
• Requires one substitution and a Taylor expansion; borderline single-step.  
• Good dimensional consistency and no superfluous symbols.  
• Acceptable but could be deepened by asking for the complete series up to O(v⁴/f⁴).

4) Diphoton shift in Neutral Naturalness  
• Legitimate multi-step (use LET, sum over charges, factor-out SM amplitude).  
• However, the prompt already states “heavy-fermion limit”; a student merely needs the known LET formula A ∝ ∑Q², then take a ratio—two short steps.  
• Q_t is fixed to 2/3 but still left as a symbol in the answer request: redundant.

Fix: Remove Q_t from the requested variables (declare it in the text) or fix it numerically; alternatively, ask for the shift in terms of the beta-function contribution of each fermion to enforce an intermediate step.

5) Vacuum-energy curvature  
• A genuine multi-step differentiation with chain rule and logarithms—good.  
• M_j are rightly shown to drop out, satisfying Guideline 4.  
• Slight over-specification: “(MS scheme)” is irrelevant for the second derivative at θ=0; could be deleted.

Fix: None essential; arguably the best item of the set.

Global recommendations
1. Ensure every problem requires at least two distinct physics principles or algebraic manipulations not already carried out in the stem.  
2. Remove or fix symbols that will not appear in the final formula.  
3. Where an inverse trig function is needed, specify a principal branch or a physical range so that the solution is unique.  
4. For advanced field-theory questions, start from an integral, symmetry argument, or equation of motion rather than from the near-final formula; this forces a real derivation.  
5. Keep wording terse: delete qualifiers like “stochastic” (unless defined) or scheme labels that play no role in the requested result.

• Acceptable but could be deepened by asking for the complete series up to O(v⁴/f⁴).

4) Diphoton shift in Neutral Naturalness  
• Legitimate multi-step (use LET, sum over charges, factor-out SM amplitude).  
• However, the prompt already states “heavy-fermion limit”; a student merely needs the known LET formula A ∝ ∑Q², then take a ratio—two short steps.  
• Q_t is fixed to 2/3 but still left as a symbol in the answer request: redundant.

Fix: Remove Q_t from the requested variables (declare it in the text) or fix it numerically; alternatively, ask for the shift in terms of the beta-function contribution of each fermion to enforce an intermediate step.

5) Vacuum-energy curvature  
• A genuine multi-step differentiation with chain rule and logarithms—good.  
• M_j are rightly shown to drop out, satisfying Guideline 4.  
• Slight over-specification: “(MS scheme)” is irrelevant for the second derivative at θ=0; could be deleted.

Fix: None essential; arguably the best item of the set.

Global recommendations
1. Ensure every problem requires at least two distinct physics principles or algebraic manipulations not already carried out in the stem.  
2. Remove or fix symbols that will not appear in the final formula.  
3. Where an inverse trig function is needed, specify a principal branch or a physical range so that the solution is unique.  
4. For advanced field-theory questions, start from an integral, symmetry argument, or equation of motion rather than from the near-final formula; this forces a real derivation.  
5. Keep wording terse: delete qualifiers like “stochastic” (unless defined) or scheme labels that play no role in the requested result.
Produce an improved set of physics questions following the original criteria.

Evaluate them against these guidelines:
1. Model a Physical Scenario: Start from a real-world or idealized setup. 2. Target a Solvable Quantity: Ask for a clear symbolic expression of a physical variable (e.g., tension, acceleration, energy). 3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning: Ensure the question involves a sequence of physics laws, transformations, and derivations to reach the answer. 4. Avoid Redundancy: Exclude extraneous details or variables that do not impact the final solution. 5. Be Unique: Do not rephrase standard textbook problems; ensure originality and complexity. 6. Single solution: Expect a single symbolic expression, unambiguous, presented in LaTeX. Multiple equivalent algebraic forms are allowed. No equations or floating-point approximations. 7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing. 8. Avoid colloquial or ambiguous terminology. 9. Units must be consisten t; symbols should follow standard notation.10. Questions must not have multiple parts to answer, there should be only 1 solution to each quesion

Overall comments  
• Every item demands several intermediate results ((a), (b)…), so each problem violates Guideline 10 (“Questions must not have multiple parts ... only 1 solution to each question”).  
• Items 1, 2 and 4 quote the target formula inside the stem (e.g. “δm²(p)=…”, “δγ=…”) which conflicts with Guideline 6 (“No near-final formula is given in the stem”).  
• Wording such as “Present each major step” or “Show that …” instructs the solver how to proceed; the rubric should describe what to find, not how to do it (Guidelines 3 and 7).  
• All five questions do model realistic scenarios and require multi-step reasoning, but they can be streamlined to one self-contained task apiece.

Specific notes and fixes  

1) Non-planar One-Loop Self-Energy  
• Near-final result δm²(p)=… is already shown → remove it.  
• Merge (a) and (b) into a single request, e.g.  
  “Derive the leading-order small-p expression for the non-planar self-energy Σ_np(p) in the limit m≪Λ.”  
• Keep only symbols that enter the answer (θ^{μν}, p∘p, Λ, g).  

2) Relaxion Stopping Point  
• The extremum equation is trivial to obtain; giving it as part (a) is redundant.  
• Collapse into one prompt:  
  “Find the unique φ∈(0,πf) that satisfies dV/dφ=0, and state the consistency condition gΛ³f<Λ_b⁴.”  
• Eliminate “principal branch only” — the domain already fixes uniqueness.  

3) Composite-Higgs HWW coupling  
• Part (a) is merely an algebraic inversion; drop it.  
• Ask directly:  
  “Expand δ_W ≡ … as a series in ε=v²/f² up to O(ε²).”  
• Then a single closed-form series is the sole deliverable.  

4) h→γγ shift  
• The final formula for δ_γ is handed to the student; delete it.  
• Combine the pieces:  
  “Using the low-energy Higgs theorem in the limit m_t,m_{t′}≫v, derive the fractional change δ_γ in the h→γγ amplitude produced by an extra heavy fermion t′.”  
• Remove explicit factors such as N_c or Q_t that cancel out; they are superfluous.  

5) Vacuum-energy curvature  
• This item already matches the guidelines fairly well.  
• Minor: make clear that μ is a constant renormalization scale to avoid ambiguity in units.

Style/phrasing adjustments for all questions  
• Replace “Show that …” with “Derive …” or “Compute …”.  
• Delete directions like “Present each major step”; the requirement for at least two distinct steps is implied by the physics.  
• Double-check that every symbol appearing in the stem also appears in the final answer; otherwise delete or define it.

After these edits each question will:  
(a) pose a single, unambiguous task,  
(b) hide the target formula,  
(c) still compel multi-step reasoning, and  
(d) satisfy the ten stated guidelines.

Below is a streamlined set of five standalone problems.  Each asks for a single symbolic result (in LaTeX) and requires at least two distinct analytic steps—but no near‐final formula is given in the stem, and no multipart (a),(b)… structure remains.

1) Non-planar One-Loop Self-Energy in NC φ⁴  
Consider a real scalar φ(x) on Euclidean ℝ⁴ with Moyal commutator [x^μ,x^ν]=i θ^{μν}.  At one loop the non-planar two-point function with hard cutoff |k|<Λ is  
 Σ_np(p) = \frac{g^2}{6}\int_{|k|<Λ}\!\frac{d^4k}{(2π)^4}\,\frac{e^{i\,k_μθ^{μν}p_ν}}{k^2 + m^2}\,.  
Here p∘p≡p_μ θ^{μρ}θ_{ρν} p^ν.  In the regime m≪Λ and small external momentum p, derive the leading-order expression for Σ_np(p) in terms of g, Λ and p∘p.

The SM top (mass m_t=y_t v/√2, charge Q_t) and a new heavy fermion t′ (mass m_{t′}=y′ v/√2, charge Q_{t′}) both couple to the Higgs.  In the limit m_t,m_{t′}≫v, the low-energy Higgs theorem gives an amplitude A(h→γγ)∝∑_iN_cQ_i^2∂_{\ln v}\ln m_i(v).  Using only this theorem, derive the fractional shift

4) h→γγ Shift from an Extra Heavy Fermion  
The SM top (mass m_t=y_t v/√2, charge Q_t) and a new heavy fermion t′ (mass m_{t′}=y′ v/√2, charge Q_{t′}) both couple to the Higgs.  In the limit m_t,m_{t′}≫v, the low-energy Higgs theorem gives an amplitude A(h→γγ)∝∑_iN_cQ_i^2∂_{\ln v}\ln m_i(v).  Using only this theorem, derive the fractional shift  
 δ_γ ≡ \frac{A(h→γγ)_{\rm SM+t'} - A(h→γγ)_{\rm SM}}{A(h→γγ)_{\rm SM}}  
in terms of Q_t, Q_{t′}, m_t and m_{t′}.  

5) Vacuum-Energy Curvature under a Light Parameter θ  
N real scalars φ_i have masses m_i(θ)=m_i^0+α_i θ; N Weyl fermions have θ-independent masses.  With renormalization scale μ, the 1-loop vacuum energy (up to θ-independent terms) is  
 ρ_{\rm vac}(θ)=\frac{1}{64π^2}\sum_{i=1}^N m_i(θ)^4\ln\frac{m_i(θ)^2}{μ^2}\,.  
Compute  
 \left.\frac{d^2ρ_{\rm vac}}{dθ^2}\right|_{θ=0}  
in closed form, showing explicitly how derivatives act on m_i(θ).
Evaluate them against these guidelines:
1. Model a Physical Scenario: Start from a real-world or idealized setup. 2. Target a Solvable Quantity: Ask for a clear symbolic expression of a physical variable (e.g., tension, acceleration, energy). 3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning: Ensure the question involves a sequence of physics laws, transformations, and derivations to reach the answer. 4. Avoid Redundancy: Exclude extraneous details or variables that do not impact the final solution. 5. Be Unique: Do not rephrase standard textbook problems; ensure originality and complexity. 6. Single solution: Expect a single symbolic expression, unambiguous, presented in LaTeX. Multiple equivalent algebraic forms are allowed. No equations or floating-point approximations. 7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing. 8. Avoid colloquial or ambiguous terminology. 9. Units must be consisten t; symbols should follow standard notation.10. Questions must not have multiple parts to answer, there should be only 1 solution to each quesion

• Strong on originality and graduate-level depth, but several items miss the rubric in the same ways:  
  – “Leading–order” or “small-p” requests leave more than one equally defensible truncation; this jeopardises the “single solution” requirement (#6, #10).  
  – Two questions explicitly ask for a second piece of information (a consistency bound or a log expansion) and therefore behave like hidden “part (b)” problems (#10).  
  – Some stems contain symbols, sentences, or historical motivation that never enter the final algebra (#4).  
  – Q 3 needs only one very short step, so it does not really “force multi-step reasoning” (#3).  

Actionable fixes question-by-question

1) Non-planar One-Loop Self-Energy  
✓ Meets #1, #3, #5.  
✗ “Leading-order” is ambiguous: do we drop the logarithm in Λ/m or keep it? Specify the required expansion (“keep the term ∝ln(Λ^2p∘p) and the constant term; ignore O(p∘p)²”).  
✗ θ^{μν} is introduced but never needed once p∘p is defined—delete the commutator line (#4).  
✗ Replace the verbal qualifier “small” with an explicit inequality, e.g. p∘p Λ²≪1 (#7, #9).

2) Unique Stopping Point of a Relaxion  
✓ Physical, original, multi-step.  
✗ You request both φ and “the consistency condition”, i.e. two answers (#10). Fold the bound into the stem: “Given gΛ³f<Λ_b⁴, find the stationary point φ …”.  
✗ Phrase “unique” mathematically (“the only stationary point in 0<φ<πf”).  
✗ Remove the interval reminder “with 0<φ<πf” once you have imposed it in the previous sentence (#4).

3) HWW Coupling in SO(5)/SO(4)  
✗ Requires only a binomial expansion—one algebraic step. Embed a second step, e.g. first express g_{HWW}/g_SM in ε and then expand; or ask for terms through O(ε³) so students must keep track of higher-order cross terms (#3).  
✗ The relation v=f sin(⟨h⟩/f) never enters the requested series; omit it (#4).  
✓ Otherwise satisfies #1, #2, #6–#9.

4) h→γγ Shift from an Extra Heavy Fermion  
✓ Multi-step (differentiate, sum, ratio), single symbolic result, good originality.  
✗ The Yukawa couplings y_t, y′ never appear in the final answer—delete them (#4).  
✗ Clarify “in the limit m_t,m_{t′}≫v” as “neglect terms suppressed by v²/m_i²”.  
✗ Mention N_c = 3 explicitly so the answer cannot differ by an overall colour factor (#6).

5) Vacuum-Energy Curvature under a Light Parameter θ  
✓ Meets all rubric points except:  
✗ “θ-independent terms” is irrelevant; delete to streamline (#4).  
✗ Make μ an implicit constant to avoid any temptation to differentiate it (#4).  
✓ Otherwise excellent.

Global wording / notation
• Replace informal phrases (“hard cutoff”, “small external momentum”) with precise inequalities.  
• Run a spell-check (“units must be consisten t”, “quesion”) in the guidelines shown to students.  
• Keep every requested quantity in math mode so the expected LaTeX output is unmistakable (e.g. δ_W, δ_γ).

Questions:
Below is a streamlined set of five standalone problems.  Each asks for a single symbolic result (in LaTeX) and requires at least two distinct analytic steps—but no near‐final formula is given in the stem, and no multipart (a),(b)… structure remains.

1) Non-planar One-Loop Self-Energy in NC φ⁴  
Consider a real scalar φ(x) on Euclidean ℝ⁴ with Moyal commutator [x^μ,x^ν]=i θ^{μν}.  At one loop the non-planar two-point function with hard cutoff |k|<Λ is  
 Σ_np(p) = \frac{g^2}{6}\int_{|k|<Λ}\!\frac{d^4k}{(2π)^4}\,\frac{e^{i\,k_μθ^{μν}p_ν}}{k^2 + m^2}\,.  
Here p∘p≡p_μ θ^{μρ}θ_{ρν} p^ν.  In the regime m≪Λ and small external momentum p, derive the leading-order expression for Σ_np(p) in terms of g, Λ and p∘p.  

2) Unique Stopping Point of a Relaxion  
A scalar φ rolls in  
 V(φ)=g Λ^3 φ + Λ_b^4 cos(φ/f)  
with 0<φ<π f and g Λ^3 f<Λ_b^4.  Find the unique φ∈(0,π f) satisfying dV/dφ=0, giving your answer in closed form and stating the consistency condition among g, Λ, Λ_b and f.  

3) HWW Coupling in the SO(5)/SO(4) Composite Higgs  
In the minimal SO(5)/SO(4) model the SM-like Higgs vev v and decay constant f satisfy v = f sin(⟨h⟩/f).  The HWW coupling deviation is defined by  
 δ_W ≡ \frac{g_{HWW} - g_{\rm SM}}{g_{\rm SM}}\,,  
with g_{HWW}=g_{\rm SM}\sqrt{1 - (v/f)^2}.  Expand δ_W as a power series in ε≡v^2/f^2 up to and including O(ε^2).

The SM top (mass m_t=y_t v/√2, charge Q_t) and a new heavy fermion t′ (mass m_{t′}=y′ v/√2, charge Q_{t′}) both couple to the Higgs.  In the limit m_t,m_{t′}≫v, the low-energy Higgs theorem gives an amplitude A(h→γγ)∝∑_iN_cQ_i^2∂_{\ln v}\ln m_i(v).  Using only this theorem, derive the fractional shift  
 δ_γ ≡ \frac{A(h→γγ)_{\rm SM+t'} - A(h→γγ)_{\rm SM}}{A(h→γγ)_{\rm SM}}  
in terms of Q_t, Q_{t′}, m_t and m_{t′}.  

5) Vacuum-Energy Curvature under a Light Parameter θ  
N real scalars φ_i have masses m_i(θ)=m_i^0+α_i θ; N Weyl fermions have θ-independent masses.  With renormalization scale μ, the 1-loop vacuum energy (up to θ-independent terms) is  
 ρ_{\rm vac}(θ)=\frac{1}{64π^2}\sum_{i=1}^N m_i(θ)^4\ln\frac{m_i(θ)^2}{μ^2}\,.

General comments  
• All stems are compact and mostly rigorous, but checking them against the ten design rules reveals a few systematic issues: (i) some symbols are introduced but never affect the answer (Rule 4), (ii) a couple of tasks are essentially single-step algebra (Rule 3), and (iii) one stem leads to an answer that no longer contains all the variables the question insists on (Rules 4 & 6).  
• Where “show that…” or “prove uniqueness” is requested, be explicit about what must appear in the final single expression and what constitutes the required analytic steps; otherwise graders will get heterogeneous answers.  
• Uniformly state all assumptions (e.g. “work in Euclidean signature”, “treat g as dimensionless”, “ignore W-loop”); unstated conventions invite ambiguity (Rule 8).  

Problem-by-problem feedback

1) Non-planar One-Loop Self-Energy  
✓ Satisfies multi-step reasoning and yields a single symbolic answer.  
✗ “g” is not dimensionless in 4 D φ⁴; tell students whether to treat it as such or keep explicit renormalisation scale.  
✗ Specify the space-time signature (“Euclidean”) and that θ^{μν} is purely spatial (otherwise p∘p can be negative).  
Action → Clarify dimensionality of g, the signature, and that terms ∝(p∘p)¹ only are required; then the stem is fine.

2) Unique Stationary Point of a Relaxion  
✓ Good real-physics context; requires two steps (take derivative, use inequality to prove monotonicity).  
✗ The final “closed form” is just φ = f arcsin(gΛ³f/Λ_b⁴); say explicitly that the student must also argue the solution is unique in (0, πf).  
Action → Replace “show that there is exactly one solution” with a graded directive such as “prove uniqueness within the given interval and give φ in closed form”.

3) HWW Coupling-Deviation Series  
✗ Only one substantive operation (Taylor expansion of √{1–ε}); rewriting δ_W is algebraically trivial. Barely meets Rule 3.  
Action → Chain an additional physical step, e.g. “then evaluate the numerical coefficient of ε³ for f = 1 TeV”, or merge with another observable so that at least two distinct analytic manipulations are indispensable.

4) h → γγ Fractional Shift  
✗ Violates Rule 4 and 6: m_t and m_{t′} cancel out (∂_{ln v} ln m_i = 1), so the requested final answer does not depend on them.  
✗ Ignores the dominant W-loop, making the setup physically incomplete and potentially misleading.  
✗ Only one algebraic step is needed (take the given sum).  
Action → (i) either keep masses by allowing non-linear v-dependence (e.g. include terms ∝ v²/m_i²) or drop them from the stem; (ii) state explicitly that the W-loop is neglected; (iii) add a second step such as converting the result into a percentage or comparing to an experimental bound.

5) Vacuum-Energy Curvature  
✓ Clear target quantity; requires chain rule and evaluation at θ = 0—multi-step.  
✗ State whether μ is held constant during differentiation and whether fermions are simply spectators (they currently never enter).  
Action → Add “All fermion contributions are θ-independent and can be discarded” so that students know to ignore them; otherwise satisfactory.

Formatting / wording  
• Spell “consistent” correctly in Rule 9 reminder.  
• Rule 10 contradicts the wording “five standalone problems” in the prompt; emphasise that each single-question stem must demand one unique symbolic answer (which they do).  

Implementing these tweaks will remove superfluous symbols, enforce genuine multi-step reasoning in every item, and make each answer uniquely determined and fully consistent with the stated guidelines.

Below is a set of five original, university‐level problems.  Each models a concise physical scenario, targets a single symbolic result, and requires at least two physics steps (e.g. matrix diagonalization, loop estimation, kinematics + statistics).  Answers are expected as a single LaTeX expression (up to algebraic equivalence).

1) Type-I Seesaw Light‐Neutrino Mass  
“Consider one active neutrino ν_L and one sterile neutrino N_R with Majorana mass M_R≫m_D.  The 2×2 mass matrix in the (ν_L, (N_R)^c) basis is  
    M = \(\begin{pmatrix}0&m_D\\m_D&M_R\end{pmatrix}.\)  
Diagonalize M in the limit M_R≫m_D to obtain the light eigenvalue m_ν.  Express m_ν to leading order in m_D/M_R.”

2) Supersymmetric Stop‐Loop Correction to Higgs Mass  
“In the MSSM in the decoupling limit, the tree‐level light CP‐even Higgs mass is m_h0^2 = m_Z^2 cos^2(2β).  Including one‐loop top‐squark (stop) corrections with two degenerate soft masses m̃≫m_t and negligible mixing, derive the corrected Higgs mass  
    m_h^2 = m_Z^2 cos^2(2β) + Δm_h^2.  
Express Δm_h^2 in terms of the top Yukawa y_t, the Higgs vev v, the stop mass m̃, and the top mass m_t.”

3) Neutrinoless Double‐β Decay and Effective Majorana Mass  
“A nucleus undergoes 0νββ decay with inverse half‐life  
    (T_{1/2})^{-1} = G_0 |M_{N}|^2 (|m_{ββ}|^2/m_e^2),  
where G_0 is the phase‐space factor, M_N the nuclear matrix element, m_e the electron mass, and m_{ββ} the effective Majorana mass.  Solve for m_{ββ} in terms of T_{1/2}, G_0, M_N, and m_e.”

4) Active–Sterile Neutrino Oscillation Probability  
“A ν_e beam of energy E (in MeV) propagates a distance L (in m) in vacuum and mixes with one sterile ν_s via angle θ and mass‐squared difference Δm^2 (in eV^2).  Show that the ν_e survival probability is  
    P_{ee}(L) = 1 − sin^2(2θ) sin^2[(1.27 Δm^2 L)/E].

You are a physics assessment expert. Critique the following questions:
Below is a set of five original, university‐level problems.  Each models a concise physical scenario, targets a single symbolic result, and requires at least two physics steps (e.g. matrix diagonalization, loop estimation, kinematics + statistics).  Answers are expected as a single LaTeX expression (up to algebraic equivalence).

1) Type-I Seesaw Light‐Neutrino Mass  
“Consider one active neutrino ν_L and one sterile neutrino N_R with Majorana mass M_R≫m_D.  The 2×2 mass matrix in the (ν_L, (N_R)^c) basis is  
    M = \(\begin{pmatrix}0&m_D\\m_D&M_R\end{pmatrix}.\)  
Diagonalize M in the limit M_R≫m_D to obtain the light eigenvalue m_ν.  Express m_ν to leading order in m_D/M_R.”

2) Supersymmetric Stop‐Loop Correction to Higgs Mass  
“In the MSSM in the decoupling limit, the tree‐level light CP‐even Higgs mass is m_h0^2 = m_Z^2 cos^2(2β).  Including one‐loop top‐squark (stop) corrections with two degenerate soft masses m̃≫m_t and negligible mixing, derive the corrected Higgs mass  
    m_h^2 = m_Z^2 cos^2(2β) + Δm_h^2.  
Express Δm_h^2 in terms of the top Yukawa y_t, the Higgs vev v, the stop mass m̃, and the top mass m_t.”

3) Neutrinoless Double‐β Decay and Effective Majorana Mass  
“A nucleus undergoes 0νββ decay with inverse half‐life  
    (T_{1/2})^{-1} = G_0 |M_{N}|^2 (|m_{ββ}|^2/m_e^2),  
where G_0 is the phase‐space factor, M_N the nuclear matrix element, m_e the electron mass, and m_{ββ} the effective Majorana mass.  Solve for m_{ββ} in terms of T_{1/2}, G_0, M_N, and m_e.”

4) Active–Sterile Neutrino Oscillation Probability  
“A ν_e beam of energy E (in MeV) propagates a distance L (in m) in vacuum and mixes with one sterile ν_s via angle θ and mass‐squared difference Δm^2 (in eV^2).  Show that the ν_e survival probability is  
    P_{ee}(L) = 1 − sin^2(2θ) sin^2[(1.27 Δm^2 L)/E].  
Provide this expression in a single symbolic line.”

5) Minimum WIMP Velocity for Nuclear Recoil  
“A dark‐matter particle of mass m_χ elastically scatters off a stationary nucleus of mass m_N, producing a nuclear recoil energy E_R.  Define the WIMP–nucleus reduced mass μ = m_χ m_N/(m_χ+m_N).  Derive the minimum WIMP speed v_min(E_R) (in the lab frame) required to yield recoil E_R.”

Each question admits a unique algebraic answer.  Please present each final result in LaTeX.
Evaluate them against these guidelines:
1. Model a Physical Scenario: Start from a real-world or idealized setup. 2. Target a Solvable Quantity: Ask for a clear symbolic expression of a physical variable (e.g., tension, acceleration, energy). 3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning: Ensure the question involves a sequence of physics laws, transformations, and derivations to reach the answer. 4. Avoid Redundancy: Exclude extraneous details or variables that do not impact the final solution. 5. Be Unique: Do not rephrase standard textbook problems; ensure originality and complexity. 6. Single solution: Expect a single symbolic expression, unambiguous, presented in LaTeX. Multiple equivalent algebraic forms are allowed. No equations or floating-point approximations. 7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing. 8. Avoid colloquial or ambiguous terminology. 9. Units must be consisten t; symbols should follow standard notation.10. Questions must not have multiple parts to answer, there should be only 1 solution to each quesion
Provide concise, actionable feedback on how to improve.

Overall strengths  
• Every prompt sets up an identifiable physical system and asks for a single symbolic result written in LaTeX.  
• Notation is mostly standard and units are stated.  

Key recurring problems  
A. Multi-step requirement is not always met (Q3 and Q4 are essentially one-line algebra or simply restate the answer).  
B. Questions 1, 2, 4, 5 are standard results that appear verbatim in many reviews; thus they do not satisfy the “be unique” guideline.  
C. Question 4 already displays the very expression students are supposed to “derive,” so the task is redundant.  
D. Some extraneous qualifiers (e.g., “degenerate soft masses … and negligible mixing” in Q2) are unnecessary once the quantity to be derived is specified.  
E. Minor typos / formatting: “consisten t” in the guidelines, “quesion” in rule 10, and inconsistent italicisation of subscripts (m_h0 vs m_h0^2).  

Question-by-question critique and fixes  

1) Type-I Seesaw Light-Neutrino Mass  
• Meets multi-step criterion (diagonalisation + expansion).  
• However it is a textbook example; re-frame to include, say, an additional Dirac partner or ask for the full mixing angle as well to raise originality.  
Action: Replace by a less-standard variant (e.g. a 3×3 matrix with one perturbation) or explicitly ask for both eigenvalues and eigenvectors while keeping the final answer a single compact object (a block-diagonal matrix).  

2) Supersymmetric Stop-Loop Correction  
• Requires RGE-style log extraction and hence is multi-step, but the final well-known result Δm_h^2 = (3y_t^4 v^2/4π^2) ln(m̃^2/m_t^2) is standard.  
• “Negligible mixing” and “decoupling limit” can be stated once; the phrase “two degenerate soft masses” is superfluous once m̃ is introduced.  
• Different renormalisation schemes can change the constant term, so “unique answer” is not strictly guaranteed.  
Action: Specify the renormalisation scheme (e.g. $\overline{\text{DR}}$ at scale m̃) or demand only the logarithmic piece. Alternatively, ask for the dependence on a small stop-mixing parameter to make the problem less canned.  

3) Neutrinoless Double-β Decay  
• Solving for m_{ββ} is a single algebraic step → violates rule 3.  
• Widely reproduced in review articles → violates rule 5.  
Action: Add a second physical step, e.g. “Given that the experimental lower limit on the half-life is T_{1/2}^{\text{exp}}, derive the corresponding upper bound on |m_{ββ}| and evaluate its scaling with nuclear charge Z.” The final answer would still be one line but the student must combine two relations.  

4) Active–Sterile Neutrino Oscillation  
• The desired formula is already printed; nothing is left to derive.  
• One-step (just copy).  
Action: Remove the displayed result and instead ask students to start from the two-flavour Hamiltonian, diagonalise, and derive P_{ee}(L). This would satisfy the multi-step requirement and avoid redundancy.  

5) Minimum WIMP Velocity  
• Acceptably unique (less common than textbook projectile motion).  
• Requires conservation of energy + momentum (two steps) → good.  
• No major issues; minor suggestion: explicitly ask to express v_min as a function of E_R, μ, and m_N only, making clear which symbols may appear.  

Global improvement checklist  
1. Ensure every problem needs at least two distinct pieces of physics or algebra.  
2. Do not display the target formula inside the prompt.  
3. Replace “classic” derivations with original twists (extra interactions, non-trivial boundary conditions, small perturbations, etc.).  
4. Strip unneeded qualifiers once variables are defined.  
5. Double-check that wording leaves no room for alternative valid answers (scheme dependence, sign conventions).  
6. Fix typos and maintain uniform subscript/superscript style.

Overall remarks  
• The set shows good technical ambition, but several items violate the stated rubric (especially #3, #5, #10).  
• Make sure every question really needs at least two distinct physics steps, introduces no superfluous sub-parts, and is not simply a textbook staple.  
• Phrase all prompts so the solver must furnish exactly one symbolic LaTeX line.

Problem-by-problem feedback

1) Seesaw Block-Diagonalization  
✓ Meets #1, #2, #3, #6, #9.  
⟡ “(N_R)^c” is irrelevant once you have declared a Majorana matrix→drops out of the algebra (violates #4).  
⟡ The seesaw 2×2 result m_ν=−m mᵀ/M is standard and widely printed; borderline on “unique” (#5).  
Action: delete “(N_R)^c”, keep only the three fields; consider giving a flavour-off-diagonal m_{12} to make the result less plug-and-play.

2) One-Loop Stop Correction  
✓ Requires effective-potential differentiation + renormalisation→clearly multistep.  
⟡ “…” inside the prompt already shows the answer’s shape; this hints at the result and weakens #5 and #7.  
⟡ Many symbols (v, m_t, m̃) appear both in the premises and in the desired answer, but m_t is actually redundant once you say “decoupling limit, evaluated at m̃” (violates #4).  
Action: remove the ellipsis, re-phrase “show that” → “derive”; state explicitly which symbols must appear in the final expression.

3) 0νββ Bound  
✗ Only a single algebraic rearrangement (take a square-root) is needed; fails #3.  
✓ Otherwise clean.  
Action: embed a second physical step, e.g. include the phase-space factor’s explicit A-dependence or require conversion to eV by inserting ħ, c; then the solver must (i) solve the inequality and (ii) perform a unit conversion.

4) Active–Sterile Oscillations  
✗ Has two sub-parts (a) and (b) → violates #10.  
✗ The final answer is already quoted in the prompt; the solver could simply copy it (hurts #3, #5).  
Action: collapse into one request: “Starting from …, derive the ν_e survival probability in SI–eV–MeV units.” Delete the pre-written formula.

5) Minimum WIMP Speed  
✓ Uses energy + momentum conservation (two steps).  
⟡ This is the canonical formula in every DM review; uniqueness weak (#5).  
⟡ Mass symbols are redundant: either μ or {m_χ, m_N} is enough; keeping all three violates #4.  
Action: make it slightly richer—e.g. include an inelastic splitting δ or ask for v_min in a lab where the nucleus is already moving. Then you truly need both energy and momentum conservation plus a frame transformation.

Summary of main edits
• Remove any multi-part structure; every problem must culminate in one requested line.  
• Eliminate pre-displayed target formulas or ellipses that betray the answer.  
• Ensure each prompt demands at least two distinct physical operations.  
• Trim unused symbols; retain only variables that survive into the final expression.  
• Inject a small twist or extra parameter where needed to lift the exercise above textbook level.

Each answer should be submitted as one compact LaTeX expression (up to algebraic equivalence).
Feedback:
Overall remarks  
• The set shows good technical ambition, but several items violate the stated rubric (especially #3, #5, #10).  
• Make sure every question really needs at least two distinct physics steps, introduces no superfluous sub-parts, and is not simply a textbook staple.  
• Phrase all prompts so the solver must furnish exactly one symbolic LaTeX line.

Problem-by-problem feedback

1) Seesaw Block-Diagonalization  
✓ Meets #1, #2, #3, #6, #9.  
⟡ “(N_R)^c” is irrelevant once you have declared a Majorana matrix→drops out of the algebra (violates #4).  
⟡ The seesaw 2×2 result m_ν=−m mᵀ/M is standard and widely printed; borderline on “unique” (#5).  
Action: delete “(N_R)^c”, keep only the three fields; consider giving a flavour-off-diagonal m_{12} to make the result less plug-and-play.

2) One-Loop Stop Correction  
✓ Requires effective-potential differentiation + renormalisation→clearly multistep.  
⟡ “…” inside the prompt already shows the answer’s shape; this hints at the result and weakens #5 and #7.  
⟡ Many symbols (v, m_t, m̃) appear both in the premises and in the desired answer, but m_t is actually redundant once you say “decoupling limit, evaluated at m̃” (violates #4).  
Action: remove the ellipsis, re-phrase “show that” → “derive”; state explicitly which symbols must appear in the final expression.

3) 0νββ Bound  
✗ Only a single algebraic rearrangement (take a square-root) is needed; fails #3.  
✓ Otherwise clean.  
Action: embed a second physical step, e.g. include the phase-space factor’s explicit A-dependence or require conversion to eV by inserting ħ, c; then the solver must (i) solve the inequality and (ii) perform a unit conversion.

4) Active–Sterile Oscillations  
✗ Has two sub-parts (a) and (b) → violates #10.  
✗ The final answer is already quoted in the prompt; the solver could simply copy it (hurts #3, #5).  
Action: collapse into one request: “Starting from …, derive the ν_e survival probability in SI–eV–MeV units.” Delete the pre-written formula.

5) Minimum WIMP Speed  
✓ Uses energy + momentum conservation (two steps).  
⟡ This is the canonical formula in every DM review; uniqueness weak (#5).  
⟡ Mass symbols are redundant: either μ or {m_χ, m_N} is enough; keeping all three violates #4.  
Action: make it slightly richer—e.g. include an inelastic splitting δ or ask for v_min in a lab where the nucleus is already moving. Then you truly need both energy and momentum conservation plus a frame transformation.

Summary of main edits
• Remove any multi-part structure; every problem must culminate in one requested line.  
• Eliminate pre-displayed target formulas or ellipses that betray the answer.  
• Ensure each prompt demands at least two distinct physical operations.  
• Trim unused symbols; retain only variables that survive into the final expression.  
• Inject a small twist or extra parameter where needed to lift the exercise above textbook level.

Evaluate them against these guidelines:
1. Model a Physical Scenario: Start from a real-world or idealized setup. 2. Target a Solvable Quantity: Ask for a clear symbolic expression of a physical variable (e.g., tension, acceleration, energy). 3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning: Ensure the question involves a sequence of physics laws, transformations, and derivations to reach the answer. 4. Avoid Redundancy: Exclude extraneous details or variables that do not impact the final solution. 5. Be Unique: Do not rephrase standard textbook problems; ensure originality and complexity. 6. Single solution: Expect a single symbolic expression, unambiguous, presented in LaTeX. Multiple equivalent algebraic forms are allowed. No equations or floating-point approximations. 7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing. 8. Avoid colloquial or ambiguous terminology. 9. Units must be consisten t; symbols should follow standard notation.10. Questions must not have multiple parts to answer, there should be only 1 solution to each quesion
Provide concise, actionable feedback on how to improve.

Problem-by-problem suggestions

1) Seesaw with a Small Light–Light Majorana Term  
▪ Delete “Schur-complement” parenthesis; simply instruct “Block-diagonalise perturbatively to first order in m_i/M and μ/M.”  
▪ State explicitly that terms O(m_i²/M, μ²/M, m_iμ/M) are to be dropped.  
▪ Otherwise meets all guidelines.

2) One-Loop Stop Correction  
▪ Allude to the DR̄ scheme only if a scheme-dependent piece really appears in the final answer; otherwise remove.  
▪ The scale choice “decoupling limit at Q = m̃” is part of the standard set-up—keep—but drop the explanatory reminder m_t = y_t v/√2.  
▪ Specify “retain terms ∝ y_t² ln(m̃² / m_t²) and ∝ y_t² X_t²/m̃² only”.  
▪ Check that no numeric constants (e.g. 3/(4π²)) have to be approximated.

3) 0νββ Bound  
▪ Rewrite to avoid two sub-tasks.  Example: “Derive an upper bound on |m_{ββ}|, expressed in eV, from T_{1/2} ≥ T_exp.”  
▪ Move the ℏc numerical value to a footnote or drop it; the final line should retain symbolic ℏ c.  
▪ Drop the phrase “exhibiting its T_exp^{-1/2} scaling”—the bound itself already shows that.

4) ν_e→ν_s Oscillations  
▪ Work entirely in natural units or state “keep ℏ = c = 1” so the final probability is P_{ee}(L) = 1 – sin²2θ sin²(Δm² L / 4E).  
▪ Remove the unit list in brackets to eliminate the temptation of inserting 1.27.  
▪ Keep the task sequence but tighten: “Diagonalise H and obtain P_{ee}(L). Provide one LaTeX line.”

5) Inelastic WIMP Minimum Speed  
▪ Very good.  One small edit: specify “neglect nuclear binding-energy corrections” to ensure uniqueness.  

Global edits to adopt  
• Strip any informal clauses (“so that”, “Starting from”).  
• Remove numeric approximations and implicit constants; leave only exact symbols (π, √2, etc.).  
• Ensure every prompt asks for exactly one final expression; combine or delete sub-steps.  
Implementing these tweaks will bring every item fully in line with the 10 stated guidelines.

H = (Δm²/4E)\bigl(−cos2θ σ_z + sin2θ σ_x\bigr)  
in a ν_e–ν_s system, diagonalise H and derive P_{ee}(L) in ℏ = c = 1 units.  Provide P_{ee}(L) as one compact LaTeX line.

5) Inelastic WIMP Minimum Speed  
A dark-matter particle χ (mass m_χ) scatters inelastically off a stationary nucleus (mass m_N), exciting χ by energy δ and producing nuclear recoil E_R.  With μ = m_χ m_N/(m_χ + m_N) and neglecting binding-energy corrections, apply energy and momentum conservation to find the minimum lab-frame speed v_{\min}(E_R).  Express v_{\min}(E_R) as a single LaTeX expression in E_R, μ, m_N and δ.
Evaluate them against these guidelines:
1. Model a Physical Scenario: Start from a real-world or idealized setup. 2. Target a Solvable Quantity: Ask for a clear symbolic expression of a physical variable (e.g., tension, acceleration, energy). 3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning: Ensure the question involves a sequence of physics laws, transformations, and derivations to reach the answer. 4. Avoid Redundancy: Exclude extraneous details or variables that do not impact the final solution. 5. Be Unique: Do not rephrase standard textbook problems; ensure originality and complexity. 6. Single solution: Expect a single symbolic expression, unambiguous, presented in LaTeX. Multiple equivalent algebraic forms are allowed. No equations or floating-point approximations. 7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing. 8. Avoid colloquial or ambiguous terminology. 9. Units must be consisten t; symbols should follow standard notation.10. Questions must not have multiple parts to answer, there should be only 1 solution to each quesion

Overall comments  
•  All five items ask for a single, symbolic end-result and do force multi-step reasoning—good.  
•  Nevertheless, each statement contains surplus phrases, undefined symbols, or mini-sub-tasks that can be stripped out to meet the rubric more tightly.  
•  Minor wording changes will make the prompts shorter, less colloquial, and fully unambiguous.

Question-by-question feedback

1) Seesaw with a Small Light–Light Majorana Term  
– “Consider …” and the subtitle add no information needed for the calculation—delete.  
– “Block-diagonalise perturbatively … dropping O(m_i²/M, …)” is correct but already implied when you say “first order in m_i/M and μ/M”.  Keep one phrasing only.  
– Define μ, m₁, m₂ once, then stop repeating subscripts.  
– Explicitly state “Provide m_{\nu} (2×2) as a single LaTeX equation.”  Nothing else.  
Revision example  
“Given the mass matrix  
M = … , with M ≫ |m_i|,|μ|, obtain the 2×2 light–neutrino mass matrix m_{\nu} to first order in m_i/M and μ/M.  Present m_{\nu} as one LaTeX expression in μ, m₁, m₂, M.”  

2) One-Loop Stop Correction in the MSSM  
– v (the electroweak vev) is never defined; add “v = 246 GeV”.  
– Phrases like “decoupling limit at scale Q = m̃” are not required once you have fixed the logarithm; delete or footnote.  
– Say “Keep only terms proportional to m_t² ln(m̃²/m_t²) and m_t² X_t²/m̃².”  No need for “dropping all others”.  
– End with: “Return Δm_h² as a single LaTeX expression.”  

3) Neutrinoless Double-β Decay Bound  
– The words “re-instating ℏ and c” are good, but “in eV” is unnecessary; dimensional analysis fixes the units once ℏc is explicit.  
– Remove the parenthetical “(in eV)”.  
– Finish with: “Give the upper bound on |m_{ββ}| as one LaTeX inequality involving G₀(A), |M_N|, m_e, ℏc, T_{\rm exp}.”  

4) ν_e→ν_s Survival Probability  
– “diagonalise H and derive” = two tasks.  Replace by “Use H to derive…”.  
– Delete “in ℏ = c = 1 units”; instead write “Assume natural units (ℏ = c = 1).” once.  
– End with: “Provide P_{ee}(L) as a single LaTeX formula.”  

5) Inelastic WIMP Minimum Speed  
– “neglecting binding-energy corrections” is irrelevant once the standard non-relativistic kinematics is stated—remove.  
– μ is already defined; do not re-define it in parentheses.  
– Close with: “Give v_{\min}(E_R) as a single LaTeX expression in E_R, μ, m_N, δ.”

General style fixes  
•  Remove all subtitles and narrative phrases; start directly with “Given…”.  
•  Define every symbol exactly once.  
•  Replace “Provide/derive/compute” with “Give” or “Obtain” to keep the wording uniform.  
•  Ensure each prompt ends with one clear deliverable: “Present … as a single LaTeX expression.”
