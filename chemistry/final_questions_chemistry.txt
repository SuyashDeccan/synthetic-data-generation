Below is a self‐contained, scenario-driven problem set.  All kinetic assumptions are explicit, IUPAC names are required, unnecessary details have been removed, and units are consistent.  Report all rate constants and activation energies to three significant figures; report ratios and TOF as directed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A new iron‐catalyzed hydroamidation protocol has been developed and thoroughly characterized.  In what follows, use R = 8.314 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹ and the Arrhenius equation in the form  
  k = A e^(–Eₐ/RT).  

1. Rate constant and mechanistic implication  
   In toluene at 80 °C, the measured rate law for the reaction of 1-hexene with benzamide catalyzed by Fe(acac)₃ is  
     rate = k [1-hexene]¹[benzamide]¹[Fe(acac)₃]^0.5.  
   An initial-rate experiment (conversion ≤ 5 %) gives  
     rate₀ = 3.00×10⁻⁴ M min⁻¹  
     [1-hexene]₀ = 0.500 M  
     [benzamide]₀ = 0.750 M  
     [Fe(acac)₃]₀ = 0.0100 M.  
   a) Calculate the rate constant k in units of M⁻¹.⁵ min⁻¹.  
   b) The half-order dependence on [Fe(acac)₃] suggests a pre-equilibrium in which a dimeric iron species converts to the active monomer.  Write a balanced pre-equilibrium expression that is consistent with the observed 0.5 order in iron.

2. Regioselectivity from ΔΔG‡  
   In a related Fe/bisphosphine-catalyzed hydroamidation of 4-methylstyrene at 298 K, the Markovnikov transition state lies 3.101 kJ mol⁻¹ lower in free energy than the anti-Markovnikov transition state.  Define  
     ΔΔG‡ = G‡(anti) – G‡(Mark) = +3.101 kJ mol⁻¹,  
   and note that the product ratio equals the ratio of rate constants, K = k_Mark/k_anti = e^(–ΔΔG‡/RT).  Calculate the product ratio  
     [Markovnikov] : [anti-Markovnikov]  
   in the form a : 1 and report to two significant figures.

3. Turnover number and frequency  
   In a C–N cross-coupling of 4-bromoanisole (1.00 mmol) with cyclohexylamine (1.20 mmol) catalyzed by an Fe–NHC complex (0.00500 mmol), the reaction mixture is stirred for 6.00 h and 0.92 mmol of N-cyclohexyl-4-methoxyaniline is formed.  
   a) Identify the limiting reagent and calculate the turnover number (TON = moles product per mole catalyst).  
   b) Calculate the turnover frequency (TOF = TON / time) in h⁻¹.  Report TOF to two significant figures.

4. IUPAC name of the anti-Markovnikov product  
   Under anti-Markovnikov conditions, 1-hexene undergoes radical hydroamidation with acetamide such that the amide N adds to C-1 of the former double bond and H to C-2.  Draw the single amide product and provide its preferred IUPAC name.

5. Activation energy and rate prediction  
   The observed first-order rate constants for iron-catalyzed hydroamidation of 1-hexene are  
     k₁ = 1.20×10⁻³ s⁻¹ at T₁ = 333 K  
     k₂ = 2.40×10⁻³ s⁻¹ at T₂ = 353 K.  
   a) Calculate the activation energy Eₐ in kJ mol⁻¹ using  
     Eₐ = R ln(k₂/k₁) / (1/T₁ – 1/T₂).  
   b) Using your Eₐ and assuming the same pre-exponential factor, predict k₃ at T₃ = 343 K.  Report k₃ in s⁻¹ to three significant figures.
