**Question:**
A photoswitchable supramolecular polymer undergoes bimolecular second-order dimerization with rate constant $k_\mathrm{dark} = 2.0 \times 10^{3}\,\mathrm{M^{-1}\,s^{-1}}$ in the dark. Under NIR irradiation (740 nm), the rate constant increases 5.0-fold, i.e., $k_\mathrm{NIR} = 5.0 \times k_\mathrm{dark}$. Assuming initial conditions with only monomer at concentration $[M] = 50.0\,\mu\mathrm{M}$ (no dimer present), calculate the initial rate of dimer formation (in $\mu\mathrm{M\,s^{-1}}$) upon NIR irradiation. Express your answer to two significant figures.

**Question:**
A photoactivatable catalyst inside a cell is irradiated with 365 nm LED light at an intensity of $1.2\,\mathrm{mW\,cm^{-2}}$ over a $1.0\,\mathrm{cm^{2}}$ area for 3.0 minutes. Assuming all incident photons are completely absorbed and that the quantum yield for conversion to the active species is 0.65 (i.e., each absorbed photon produces 0.65 molecules of active catalyst), calculate the number of moles of active catalyst generated during irradiation. Use $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34}\,\mathrm{J\cdot s}$, $c = 3.00 \times 10^{8}\,\mathrm{m/s}$, and Avogadro’s number $N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23}$. Express your answer in moles to two significant figures.

**Question:**
A NIR-fluorophore-tagged supramolecular assembly exhibits biexponential fluorescence decay with lifetimes $\tau_1 = 1.2\,\mathrm{ns}$ (amplitude 0.60) and $\tau_2 = 4.8\,\mathrm{ns}$ (amplitude 0.40).
