<question>  
In the large-scale synthesis of a β-trifluoromethyl β-diazo ester, the diazo transfer step has a 75% yield and is kinetically limited by the nucleophilic attack of the diazo precursor on trifluoroacetyl chloride. If 200 g of the β-trifluoromethyl β-keto ester (molar mass = 200 g·mol⁻¹) is used, calculate the maximum amount (in grams) of the β-trifluoromethyl β-diazo ester (molar mass = 214 g·mol⁻¹) that can be formed, assuming the diazo transfer is the only limiting step and no other losses occur.</question>  

<question>  
During the Mumm rearrangement of a trifluoromethyl-substituted imidate ester, the rate constant at 298 K is measured as $1.2 \times 10^{-3} \, s^{-1}$.

A nitrile ylide intermediate is generated in situ from a β-trifluoromethyl α-diazo ester via photolysis.

**General Feedback:**  
Most questions meet the guidelines in spirit, but a few can be improved for maximal clarity, rigor, and adherence to the given criteria. Below is itemized, actionable feedback for each question; issues are referenced by the specified guidelines.

---

### Question 1
**Positives:**  
- Models a plausible, relevant synthetic scenario (Guideline 1).
- Requires yield calculation; single numerical answer in grams (Guidelines 2, 6).
- Multi-step reasoning: molar conversions, yield consideration (Guideline 3).

**Improvements:**  
- The phrase "is kinetically limited by the nucleophilic attack..." may add context, but isn't directly relevant for the calculation; could be omitted to comply more strictly with Guideline 4 (no extraneous information).
- Wording could be made even tighter/less narrative: e.g., "200 g of β-trifluoromethyl β-keto ester (molar mass = 200 g·mol⁻¹) is subjected to diazo transfer (75% yield). What is the mass (g) of β-trifluoromethyl β-diazo ester (molar mass = 214 g·mol⁻¹) produced, assuming this is the only limiting step?"

---

### Question 2
**Positives:**  
- Eyring equation calculation, numerical answer required (Guidelines 2, 3).
- All constants given = no ambiguity.
- Single unique answer (Guideline 6).

**Improvements:**  
- Minor: The context ("Mumm rearrangement...") is more flavor than necessary — you could remove it and just refer to "a reaction" (Guideline 4).
- Minor: The value of $k_B T/h$ at 308 K should also be provided or derivable from the data; currently it is only at 298 K, and using it at another temperature requires clarification (potential for confusion).  
  *Action:* Either require use of the 298 K value (which is realistic given the very small $T$ change), or state "assume $k_B T/h$ does not significantly change over this temperature range" for clarity.

---

### Question 3
**Positives:**  
- Realistic photochemical calculation; correct amount of information provided; unique numerical answer (Guidelines 1, 2, 6, 8).
- Multi-step reasoning enforced (Guideline 3).

**Improvements:**  
- Specify that the molar concentration is with respect to final solution volume (avoids minor ambiguity).
- Consider stating that $100$ mL $\equiv 0.100$ L explicitly to avoid confusion around units.

---

### Question 4
**Positives:**  
- Calculation of rate/half-life with modified rate constant; multi-step (Guideline 3).
- Provides all constants unambiguously (Guidelines 2, 6, 8, 9).

**Improvements:**  
- Clarify "reduces the rate constant by 0.52": it could mean "to 52% of original" or "decreased BY 0.52×". Recommend, e.g., "reduces the rate constant to 0.52 times the value for unsubstituted styrene" for mathematical unambiguity (Guideline 8).

---

### Question 5
**Positives:**  
- Straightforward thermodynamics calculation; single value to be found (kJ/mol, two decimal places) (Guidelines 2, 6, 9).
- Multi-step: must calculate $\Delta G^\ddagger$ from $\Delta H^\ddagger$ and $\Delta S^\ddagger$ at a given $T$ (Guideline 3).

**Improvements:**  
- Introduction about mechanism is not needed; could be omitted for brevity (Guideline 4).
- Make clear that units for $\Delta S^\ddagger$ are consistent (which they are).

---

### Question 6
**Positives:**  
- Mass-yield product calculation; all stoichiometry provided; single result in grams (Guidelines 2, 6).
- Details force multi-step calculation (Guideline 3).

**Improvements:**  
- The term "quantitative" and "90% yield" are slightly redundant — instead, just state "50 mmol of β-trifluoromethyl β-diazo ester... with a 90% yield" (Guideline 4).
- "Complete conversion" is redundant with "quantitative" or "90% yield".

---

### Question 7
**Positives:**  
- Kinetics/Arrhenius calculation; multi-step; expects numerical value with correct units and precision (Guidelines 2, 3, 6, 9).

**Improvements:**  
- Introduction could be condensed: "A β-trifluoromethyl β-diazo ester decomposes with first-order kinetics. Its half-life at 323 K is 15 min. Given $E_a = 110$ kJ·mol⁻¹, calculate its half-life at 333 K ($R = 8.314$ J·mol⁻¹·K⁻¹, answer in min, two significant figures)."
- Specify to round to two significant figures, not decimal places, for precision clarity.

---

### Question 8
**Positives:**  
- Realistic selectivity/activation entropy problem; unique answer (Guideline 6).
- Multi-step required (Guideline 3).

**Improvements:**  
- Could rephrase for greater rigor: e.g., "Selectivity favors product A over side product B by factor X... Given $\Delta H^\ddagger_\text{diff}$, what is $\Delta S^\ddagger_\text{diff}$?"  
- "Pre-exponential factor is modified solely by entropy changes" is appropriate, but clarify "the ratio $A_\text{A}/A_\text{B}$ is determined by entropy difference" (Guideline 8).

---

### Question 9
**Positives:**  
- Enforces IUPAC naming; single structural outcome (Guidelines 2, 6, 9).
- Synthetic context is advanced/unique (Guideline 5).

**Improvements:**  
- Rather than "construct the balanced IUPAC name", say "Provide the IUPAC name..." (shorter/clearer).
- Ensure no ambiguity in ring numbering/substituent positions: could explicitly specify the starting compound's connectivity/confidence in exclusive regioselectivity.

---

### Question 10
**Positives:**  
- Explores thermodynamics of conformational isomerization (Guidelines 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9).
- Multi-step (calculate $\Delta G^\ddagger$ from equilibrium).

**Improvements:**  
- Introduction about "the rate-determining step" is awkward — instead, specify task: "Given the equilibrium constant $K = 14$ for cis-trans isomerization..."  
- Clarify if the answer should be the Gibbs activation free energy for the transition (i.e., for cis$\rightarrow$trans or vice versa).
- Given only $K$, strictly one can calculate $\Delta G^\circ$ for the equilibrium, not necessarily the rotational barrier (which generally requires kinetic data). If intending $\Delta G^\ddagger = -RT \ln(K)$, clarify or adjust.

---

## General & Formatting Points

- All questions use $…$ for inline math and (mostly) clear variable notation.
- Each asks for a single, unambiguous result.
- Keep contexts brief — just enough to ground the problem, no more.
- Avoid statements or phrases not directly needed for the calculation.
- Ensure explicitness about conventions and units.
- Double-check that only one variable/result is left unspecified.
- Whenever discussing rates, clarify factors/changes to avoid ambiguity.

- **Units and Significant Figures.** Use the phrase "Provide your answer to $n$ significant figures" rather than "with $n$ decimal places" for consistency with chemical standards.
- **Explicit Numbering for Structures/Nomenclature.** If ring numbering is required for naming, describe or indicate the numbering scheme to avoid IUPAC ambiguity.
- **Clear Assumptions for Light/Photon Questions.** Explicitly state whether incident photons are all absorbed or if quantum yield applies to all absorbed photons.

- Each question is self-contained and requires a single, unambiguous solution (guidelines 6 and 10).
- Questions require substantial multi-step reasoning (guideline 3), often combining stoichiometry, kinetics, thermodynamics, and/or nomenclature.
- Equation formatting is generally correct, with proper use of $...$ and $$...$$ to comply with Markdown rendering (guideline 11).
- The phrasing is concise, technical, and avoids colloquial language (guidelines 7 and 8).
- Units are consistently used throughout (guideline 9).
- Chemical nomenclature is requested using IUPAC rules where appropriate (guideline 2).

---

**Specific Feedback and Recommendations:**

### 1. Stoichiometry/Diazo Transfer (Q1)

**Feedback:**
- Scenario is clear. Requires a numeric answer with units.
- Extraneous details (e.g., "no side reactions") are minimal but could be omitted as the single yield figure already implies that.
- "Calculate the mass (in grams)..." could be improved to: "Calculate the mass, in grams, ..."

**Suggestion:**  
Keep only the necessary information for the single solution (e.g., "Assume 75% yield.").  

---

### 2. Eyring Equation (Q2)

**Feedback:**
- Multistep physical chemistry problem, clear setup.
- The Eyring equation is written correctly and all constants specified.
- The "frequency factor" concept is slightly misapplied for the Eyring equation (it is not called frequency factor but rather the $k_BT/h$ pre-exponential term).
- "Assume the frequency factor $k_B T/h$ remains constant" is slightly ambiguous at different $T$.

**Suggestion:**  
Clarify that "use $k_B T/h = 6.2 \times 10^{12} \, s^{-1}$ for both temperatures" rather than assuming it's constant, to avoid confusion.

---

### 3. Quantum Yield/Photolysis (Q3)

**Feedback:**
- Realistic photochemical setup, correctly specifies quantum yield, photon flux, and time.
- Asking for "molar concentration...in a volume of..." requires a multi-step calculation.
- Units are clear.

**Suggestion:**  
None needed; well constructed.

---

### 4. Radical Addition Kinetics (Q4)

**Feedback:**
- Concisely frames a pseudo-first-order scenario.
- Requires computation of an actual half-life, given all parameters.
- The term "trifluoromethyl radical is in large excess" is precise but could be replaced with "pseudo-first-order conditions with respect to styrene" for rigor.

**Suggestion:**  
Consider directly stating "Assume pseudo-first-order conditions with respect to the styrene derivative."

---

### 5. $\Delta G^\ddagger$ Calculation (Q5)

**Feedback:**
- Good use of thermodynamic parameters, one clear solution.
- All units and parameters specified.
- "Provide your answer to two significant figures" is proper, though best practice is to bracket this early, e.g., "Calculate, to two significant figures, the..."

**Suggestion:**  
Minor: Place the significant figure instruction earlier in the sentence.

---

### 6. Product Mass from Cycloaddition (Q6)

**Feedback:**
- Precise stoichiometric calculation, all data supplied.
- "Theoretical mass" could be replaced with "Calculate the mass, in grams...".

**Suggestion:**  
Standardize "Calculate the mass, in grams, of..."

---

### 7. Arrhenius/Half-life Calculation (Q7)

**Feedback:**
- Properly sets up for two-temperature Arrhenius calculation.
- Clear specifications.

**Suggestion:**  
None needed.

---

### 8. Selectivity/Entropy Difference (Q8)

**Feedback:**
- Unique, multi-step comparison of pathways via Arrhenius parameters.
- Clear in stating what to calculate.

**Suggestion:**  
Clarify that only the entropy difference in the *pre-exponential* (not including degeneracy etc.) is to be calculated, perhaps: "Assume that the difference in pre-exponential factors is solely due to the activation entropy difference."

---

### 9. IUPAC Naming (Q9)

**Feedback:**
- Presents a unique and challenging bu straightforward IUPAC nomenclature task.
- Details on ring numbering improve clarity.

**Suggestion:**  
No major improvements; this is a best-practice example.

---

### 10. $\Delta G^\circ$ from $K_{eq}$ (Q10)

**Feedback:**
- Crisp, single-solution thermodynamics calculation.
- All units, parameters, and temperature specified.

**Suggestion:**  
None needed.

---

### 11. Qualitative Kinetics Conceptual Question (Q11)

**Feedback:**
- Seeks qualitative discussion, but per the guideline, every question should **require a single, explicit answer**.
- This question is open-ended, violating guideline 6 (single solution), and somewhat violates guideline 10.

**Suggestion:**  
Transform to a calculation ("If the rate constant for cis-trans interconversion is $x$, what is $\Delta G^\ddagger$ if $t_{1/2}$ is $y$ s at $z$ K?") or ask for a specific quantity derivable from the data.

## **Global Recommendations to Improve the Set**

1. **Standardize phrasing:** Use "Calculate the [quantity], in [units], ..." and indicate expected significant figures at the start.
2. **Eliminate minor redundancies:** For example, don't state "no side reactions" if yield is already specified.
3. **Be explicit about conventions:** When constants or approximations are required, specify precisely.
4. **Avoid open-ended prompts:** All questions should have a single, explicit answer (numerical, or IUPAC name).
5. **Retain uniqueness and advanced reasoning:** These are strengths of your set; continue to build on them.

**With these minor refinements, you will fully meet the outlined guidelines.**
