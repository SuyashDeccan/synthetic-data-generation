---

### Question 9

- **Strengths:** Clear real-world scenario, only requires a single calculation, all variables clear.
- **Issues:** None.
- **Suggestions:** None.

---

### Question 10

**General Assessment**  
These questions are overall well-written, integrate chemical/physical reasoning, and require multi-step calculations applied to an advanced electrochemistry context (MXene electrodes), which adheres well to your guidelines. They specify starting parameters, enforce quantitative answers (with units or dimensionless), and expect IUPAC and SI conformity. Below is question-by-question, guideline-targeted feedback, followed by general suggestions.

---

### Question-by-Question Feedback

---

#### 1. Ratio of Capacitance via EIS and Proton Mobility

**Strengths:**  
- Clearly models a chemistry scenario stemming from real electrode/electrolyte tests.  
- Asks for a numerical, unitless ratio—directly aligned with the guidelines.
- Forces application of both impedance and ion transport concepts.

**Improvements:**  
- Consider a clearer prompt or brief explanation connecting charge transfer resistance, ion mobility, and $C_\mathrm{dl}$. Some could interpret $R_{ct}$ as not necessarily depending on $C_\mathrm{dl}$ and $\mu$ alone; clarifying your idealized scenario assumptions (all else constant, "dominated by proton transfer, etc.") will prevent ambiguous reasoning.
- Minor: Specify "full calculation" or explicitly state "Show your calculation" to avoid ambiguity.
- '%' symbol for "dimensionless" is not required — ask only for a ratio.

---

#### 2. Percentage Error Between Relaxation Time and RC Constant

**Strengths:**  
- Stays in the chemical/electrochemical domain (DRT, relaxation, RC).
- Demands actual error calculation, enforcing multi-step reasoning.

**Improvements:**  
- The question is very explicit; wording is slightly verbose.  
- To avoid redundancy, "characteristic time τ=..." and "relaxation time τ" both refer to the same value—choose one.
- Specify "percentage error" formula if you want consistent answers (some do "$\frac{|\tau-RC|}{RC} \times 100$%", others "$\frac{|\tau-RC|}{\tau} \times 100$%"). Clarify which.
- Check units: all input data should be SI for consistency, though here it's fine.

---

#### 3. Warburg Coefficient Calculation

**Strengths:**  
- Mixes realistic calculation (parameters, units, proton concentration in mol·cm⁻³).
- Formula is complex—forces careful, unit-attentive work.

**Improvements:**  
- Give all necessary physical constants with number of significant figures you expect.
- No extraneous or redundant information—very efficient.

---

#### 4. Capacitance Ratio from RC Elements at Different Frequencies

**Strengths:**  
- Clearly grounded in DRT physics and frequency-dependent electrochemical modeling.
- Demands reasoning from frequency to RC to $\frac{C_2}{C_1}$.

**Improvements:**  
- Under-specified what "characteristic relaxation time" for a given frequency means ($\tau = 1/2\pi f$?), though the context suggests this.
- Could explicitly instruct: "Assume $\tau = 1/(2\pi f)$" to avoid ambiguity over $\tau$ definition.
- Redundancy: Don't say both "relaxation time $\tau$" and "frequency-dependent admittance" — just link via the RC model.

---

#### 5. Complex Capacitance Magnitude at Given $\theta$ and $R_{ct}$

**Strengths:**  
- Original, integrates phase relations.
- Forced to combine multiple elements—model, convert degrees/radians, etc.

**Improvements:**  
- "Assume constant $R_{ct}$ and frequency" not strictly necessary since both are provided.
- Equation uses $\cos \theta$ with $\theta$ in degrees; remind students to use radians, or write: "with $\theta$ in degrees".
- The phrase "capacitive loop" could be clarified (i.e., refers to the Nyquist plot semicircle at that frequency).

---

#### 6. Warburg Impedance at Given Frequency

**Strengths:**  
- Concrete, realistic scenario.
- Requires unit and root handling (frequency to $\omega$, s⁻¹).

**Improvements:**  
- None significant—clear and unique.

---

#### 7. Internal Electric Field from Drift Time

**Strengths:**  
- Forces use of drift/diffusion and mobility relationships.
- Units and all variables explicit; IUPAC and SI compliance.

**Improvements:**  
- Units for thickness $d$ require conversion; could specify "convert to cm".
- Minor: If seeking two significant figures, specify all input quantities accordingly.

---

#### 8. Charge Transfer Resistance (Butler–Volmer) and $i_0$ Factor

**Strengths:**  
- Direct, multi-step.
- Application of key electrochemical kinetics.

**Improvements:**  
- None substantial.
- Could state "Report just the factor ($i_0^{[\text{high}]} / i_0^{[\text{low}]}$)..."

---

#### 9. Change in Solution Resistance and Electrolyte Conductivity

**Strengths:**  
- Realistic, requires linking measurement to physical cell geometry and conductance.
- All SI conversions explicit.

**Improvements:**  
- Could specify "Assume negligible contribution from other resistances in the cell."
- Clearly say: "Report $\Delta\kappa = \kappa_2 - \kappa_1$ as a positive or negative value".

---

#### 10. Capacitance from RC Time Constant and Frequency

**Strengths:**  
- Integrates real measurement scenario (DRT peak at given frequency and known $R$).
- Simple but not trivial (requires two steps, formula rearrangement).

**Improvements:**  
- Could clarify which formula for $\tau$ to use: "$\tau = \frac{1}{2\pi f}$".
- Explicitly say: "Report $C$ in $\mu$F with three significant figures".

---

### Overall/General Actionable Feedback

1. **Specify/Clarify Conventions:**  
   - For calculations with multiple conventions (τ definition, percentage error, degrees/radians), state your intended convention.
2. **Avoid Mild Redundancy:**  
   - Reduce doubling up of terminology. If you specify $f$ and say "at this frequency," you don't also need to say "with characteristic $\tau$."
3. **Units Consistency:**  
   - For input parameters (thickness in μm, mobility in cm², etc.), explicitly state units expected for answer, and where conversions are necessary.
4. **Focus on One Solution:**  
   - Your questions do not demand multiple numerical answers; they align with 'single solution' well.
5. **Prompt Multi-Step Calculation:**  
   - All questions demand more than one operation or formula, in line with the goal.
6. **Avoid Ambiguity:**  
   - For less-standard electrochemical relations, briefly define parameter relations, or assume the idealized model.
7. **Equation Formatting:**  
   - You have used correct Markdown/LaTeX. Ensure students are not confused with inline vs block formulas: be consistent about which is for key equations.
8. **Exclude Colloquial/Non-Rigorous Terms:**  
   - There is little informal language; good rigor is maintained throughout.

---

**Overall verdict:** These questions closely fit your guidelines.  
**Key improvements are:**  
- Minor clarifications for conventions, reduction of mildly redundant statements, reinforce unit conversions, and, where necessary, slight re-phrasings for complete unambiguity. The complexity, originality, and requirement for multi-step reasoning are excellent throughout.

Below is a concise critique of your questions with actionable improvement points for each, mapped onto your guidelines. **Overall, your questions are advanced, well-contextualized, and demand multi-step problem-solving.** They typically satisfy units and nomenclature guidelines. Some can be improved for focus, concise phrasing, and strict adherence to the “single solution/no multipart” rule.

- Units and chemical context are appropriate.
- Only one solution is possible.

**Improvement:**  
- Good as is. The scenario is a touch niche, but this increases uniqueness, not confusion.

---

### Q3: Warburg Coefficient Calculation
**Strengths:**  
- All parameters are specified; multi-step calculation is required.
- Clear instruction on units and significant figures.
- Chemical context and units are correct.

**Improvement:**  
- The formula box is good, but you might clarify that all parameters are provided in the correct units for the calculation, if needed (“with parameters as defined above”).

---

### Q4: Capacitance Ratio from DRT Peak Frequencies
**Strengths:**  
- Subtle scenario using DRT and RC analog interpretation.
- All steps, variables, and units are defined.

**Improvement:**  
- Clarify “assuming these correspond to ideal parallel RC elements with equal resistances $R$” (partly implied, but explicit statement is clearer).
- Wording “calculate the capacitance ratio $C_2/C_1$” is good, but explicitly state “Express your answer as a dimensionless number with three significant figures.” at the end for consistency (already present, so just make sure placement is consistent).

---

### Q5: Complex Capacitance from Impedance Data
**Strengths:**  
- Complex but realistic electrochemical calculation.
- All units, formula, and answer requirements clear.

**Improvement:**  
- Check that “capacitive loop with phase angle” is clear—maybe add “measured at…” to remove any ambiguity.
- The formula given assumes phase angle in degrees; some students may default to radians, so explicitly state “where $\theta$ is in degrees” directly after the formula.

---

### Q6: Warburg Impedance Magnitude Calculation
**Strengths:**  
- Well-specified, with single solution and clear units.
- Chemistry scenario is solid.

**Improvement:**  
- Minor: The phrase “is dominated by the double-layer capacitance” is not relevant to the calculation and could be omitted to focus the question (Guideline 4).

---

### Q7: Calculate Internal Electric Field from DRT
**Strengths:**  
- Units, scenario, and numerical answer required are correct.

**Improvement:**  
- “Convert units where necessary” is slightly open-ended. State the units for thickness in micrometers ($\mu$m) and required answer in V/cm within the calculation prompt directly. E.g., “Express $d$ in cm for calculation.”

---

### Q8: $R_{ct}$ and $i_0$ Concentration Dependence
**Strengths:**  
- Realistic, multi-step reasoning needed.
- Only one possible numerical answer.

**Improvement:**  
- Minor: specify units or leave out if dimensionless (factor only).
- Could add “Assume all other factors remain constant.”

---

### Q9: Conductivity Change from $R_s$ Shift
**Strengths:**  
- Chemistry scenario is robust and calculation well-posed.
- All parameters, variable definitions, and units clear.

**Improvement:**  
- “Assuming this shift equals the change in solution resistance $R_s$” could be worded more mathematically: “Given $\Delta R_s = 4~\Omega$, calculate…”

---

### Q10: Capacitance from Frequency and Resistance
**Strengths:**  
- All variables and units are explicitly defined.
- Forces multi-step calculation.

**Improvement:**  
- None significant; this is concise and well-posed.

## **General Actionable Feedback**
1. **Conciseness:** Remove extraneous qualifying phrases and ensure only information required for the calculation appears.  
2. **Equation Formatting:** Your LaTeX/Markdown usage conforms to best practices.
3. **Single Solution/No Multi-Part:** All questions demand only one explicit answer; none require "list all possible," etc.
4. **Nomenclature/Units:** All units are correctly specified; where dimensionless, make this explicit.
5. **Unique & Nonstandard Context:** Your focus on MXenes and EIS keeps all scenarios original and non-repetitive.
6. **No Redundancy:** Trim brief asides that do not alter the calculation, e.g., how $R_{ct}$ was measured if already given.
7. **Rigorous/Chemical:** No colloquialisms or ambiguous terminology.  
8. **Suggestive Phrasing:** Rather than “Convert units if necessary,” specify which units should be used for each variable and the answer.

An MXene electrode is tested in two electrolytes: 0.5 M sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) and 0.5 M perchloric acid (HClO₄). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at 1 kHz yields charge transfer resistances ($R_{ct}$) of 12 Ω and 22 Ω, respectively.
