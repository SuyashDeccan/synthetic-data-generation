=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here is a concise critique and actionable feedback for **each question** based on your 11 guidelines:

---

### 1. Activation energy, Arrhenius ratio
**Critique:**  
- **Good**: Single formula, clear end value, one numerical answer, units consistent, not redundant.
- **Improvement**: Not a particularly fresh context ("calculate $k_{310}/k_{298}$"), slightly standard (guideline 5).
- **Action**: Frame it with a context (e.g., an enzyme’s rate at fever vs normal temperature) to make it less generic and more “simple scenario.” Rephrase to:  
  ```markdown
  An enzymatic reaction has an activation energy of $78.5\ \mathrm{kJ\cdot mol^{-1}}$. Calculate the ratio of rate constants, $k_{310}/k_{298}$, corresponding to body temperature (310 K) and room temperature (298 K) using the Arrhenius equation. Assume $R=8.314\ \mathrm{J\cdot mol^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}}$. Report your answer to two decimal places.
  ```
---

### 2. Selectivity from $\Delta\Delta G^\ddagger$
**Critique:**  
- **Good**: Single calculation, clear formula, concise.
- **Improvement**: Mixing “Boltzmann distribution” with selectivity may cause confusion for non-specialists (guideline 7/8). Check the sign in the exponent: For selectivity, it's *usually* $\exp(-\Delta\Delta G^\ddagger/RT)$.
- **Action**: Rephrase for clarity, check Boltzmann sign, frame as a product ratio.  
  ```markdown
  At 298 K, the difference in activation free energy between two pathways is $\Delta\Delta G^{\ddagger} = 5.0\ \mathrm{kJ\cdot mol^{-1}}$. Calculate the selectivity ratio $P_{\alpha}:P_{\beta}$ using $P_{\alpha}/P_{\beta} = \exp(-\Delta\Delta G^{\ddagger}/(RT))$ with $R = 8.314\ \mathrm{J\cdot mol^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}}$. Report the ratio to one decimal place.
  ```
---

### 3. Equilibrium constant from $\Delta G$
**Critique:**  
- **Good**: Formula application, single answer, units good, concise phrasing.
- **Improvement**: Mention system/context (e.g., a dissolved acid) for freshness; otherwise, textbook style.
- **Action**: Add a context.  
  ```markdown
  At 298 K, the isomerization of substance A to B has $\Delta G = -12.4\ \mathrm{kJ\cdot mol^{-1}}$. Calculate the equilibrium constant $K = \exp(-\Delta G/(RT))$ using $R = 8.314\ \mathrm{J\cdot mol^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}}$. Report $K$ to two significant digits.
  ```
---

### 4. Find Arrhenius $A$ from $k$, $E_a$, $T$
**Critique:**  
- **Good**: One step, clear variables, proper units.
- **Improvement**: Not unique, textbook style, context missing.
- **Action**: Set in context (e.g., the decomposition rate of hydrogen peroxide in a fridge).  
  ```markdown
  At 273 K, the first-order decomposition of hydrogen peroxide has $k = 4.2 \times 10^{-4}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $E_a = 82.0\ \mathrm{kJ\cdot mol^{-1}}$. Estimate the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor $A$ in $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ using $R = 8.314\ \mathrm{J\cdot mol^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}}$. Report $A$ in scientific notation rounded to two significant digits.
  ```
---

### 5. IUPAC of cyclized glucosyl oxonium ion
**Critique:**  
- **Good**: Demands single compound name, rigorous nomenclature.
- **Improvement**: Not a “simple scenario” (guideline 1), may lack adequate information for one correct IUPAC name (ambiguity in cyclic oxonium naming).
- **Action**: Specify the exact structure or reference, or switch to a carbohydrate commonly encountered in the lab.
- **Suggestion**: If you want one unique answer, provide a structure or explicit chemical, or clarify the expected naming rules.

---

### 6. Rate constant for $\beta$ from $\Delta G^{\ddagger}$ diff
**Critique:**  
- **Good**: One formula, concise, single answer.
- **Improvement**: Let the context be a reaction (e.g., hydrolysis in water); check for sign conventions.
- **Action**: Add a context, clarify pre-exponential factor.  
  ```markdown
  In a glycosylation reaction at 298 K, the activation free energies are $\Delta G^{\ddagger}_\alpha = 90.0\ \mathrm{kJ\cdot mol^{-1}}$ and $\Delta G^{\ddagger}_\beta = 91.2\ \mathrm{kJ\cdot mol^{-1}}$. The rate constant for the $\alpha$ pathway is $2.0 \times 10^{-3}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Calculate the rate constant for the $\beta$ pathway assuming identical pre-exponential factors, using $R=8.314\ \mathrm{J\cdot mol^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}}$. Report $k_{\beta}$ rounded to two significant digits.
  ```
---

### 7. $\Delta \Delta G^\ddagger$ from selectivity ratio
**Critique:**  
- **Good**: Direct application, clear answer.
- **Improvement**: More engaging if set in real process context (e.g., "in a laboratory glycosylation").
- **Action**: Add context, clarify positive/negative signs.  
  ```markdown
  In a laboratory glycosylation at 298 K, the selectivity ratio is $P_{\alpha}:P_{\beta} = 10:1$. Calculate the difference in activation free energy $\Delta \Delta G^{\ddagger}$ in $\mathrm{kJ\cdot mol^{-1}}$ using $P_{\alpha}/P_{\beta} = \exp(-\Delta \Delta G^{\ddagger}/(RT))$, with $R=8.314\ \mathrm{J\cdot mol^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}}$. Round your answer to one decimal place.
  ```

---

### 8. Selectivity ratio from $\Delta\Delta G^\ddagger$
**Critique:**  
- **Good**: Clear, one formula, one answer.
- **Improvement**: Add a context (simple chemical or lab process).
- **Action**:  
  ```markdown
  Given an activation free energy difference of $3.7\ \mathrm{kJ\cdot mol^{-1}}$ at 298 K for two product pathways, calculate the selectivity ratio $P_{\alpha}:P_{\beta}$ using $P_{\alpha}/P_{\beta} = \exp(-\Delta\Delta G^{\ddagger}/(RT))$ with $R=8.314\ \mathrm{J\cdot mol^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}}$. Report your answer rounded to one decimal place.
  ```

---

### 9. Gibbs activation energy from $\Delta H^{\ddagger}$ and $\Delta S^{\ddagger}$
**Critique:**  
- **Good**: Direct formula, clear answer.
- **Improvement**: Could use a more interesting scenario (reaction in solution).
- **Action**:  
  ```markdown
  For a reaction in aqueous solution at 300 K, the activation enthalpy is $\Delta H^{\ddagger} = 80.0\ \mathrm{kJ\cdot mol^{-1}}$ and activation entropy is $\Delta S^{\ddagger} = -50.0\ \mathrm{J\cdot mol^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}}$. Calculate the Gibbs activation energy $\Delta G^{\ddagger}$ in $\mathrm{kJ\cdot mol^{-1}}$. Report your answer rounded to one decimal place.
  ```

---

### 10. IUPAC name for bicyclic intermediate
**Critique:**  
- **Good**: Single answer, rigorous, concise.
- **Improvement**: As with #5, may not be straightforward to produce a unique IUPAC name from textual information alone (potential ambiguity, guideline 6). Not “simple scenario.”
- **Action**: Provide explicit structural context (SMILES, image, or precise description), or use a more conventional compound.
---

## **General Recommendations:**
- **Always** frame each calculation in context: use a real/laboratory scenario or relatable chemical process (guideline 1, 5).
- Use full, rigorous, unambiguous chemical terminology.
- **Specify** what is being named or calculated with enough detail to ensure a unique answer (critical for nomenclature).
- **Clarify** all signs and formulae, especially for logarithmic/ratio relations—avoid new user confusion.
- Put **every revised final question** into an inline Markdown code snippet, as requested.

## **Example of a model inline question:**
```markdown
A first-order reaction at 298 K has a rate constant $k = 2.5 \times 10^{-3}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and an activation energy of $70.0\ \mathrm{kJ\cdot mol^{-1}}$. Calculate the pre-exponential factor $A$ in $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ using the Arrhenius equation ($R = 8.314\ \mathrm{J\cdot mol^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}}$). Report $A$ in scientific notation to two significant digits.

=== Turn 2: Critic feedback ===
Certainly! Here is a concise critique and targeted feedback for each question according to your guidelines:

---

### 1. Activation Energy, Arrhenius Ratio
**Critique:**
- **Strengths:** Lab context (enzyme), expects single numerical answer, concise, SI units, single formula.
- **Improvements:** 
   - The enzyme context is mentioned but not used in the calculation, which is generic Arrhenius math.
   - Could be more "real" by specifying a reaction more explicitly or giving a mini scenario.
   - The instruction "constant pre-exponential factor" is slightly redundant if not comparing more than two values.

**Actionable Feedback:**  
Anchor the scenario to a named enzyme/reaction or context (e.g., "The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by catalase..."). Remove statements about "constant pre-exponential factor" unless comparing two different systems.

---

### 2. Selectivity Ratio from ΔΔG‡
**Critique:**
- **Strengths:** Standard formula use, concise phrasing, SI units, clear answer format.
- **Improvements:** 
   - Overlaps with Q8: nearly identical selectivity calculations, just different ΔΔG‡ values.
   - Context is generic; could specify a practical scenario (e.g., "In a synthetic carbohydrate coupling reaction...").

**Actionable Feedback:**  
Refresh context with a specific reaction or product type. Remove redundancy with similar questions.

---

### 3. Equilibrium Constant from ΔG
**Critique:**
- **Strengths:** Clear, uses a direct formula, SI units, concise, chemical isomerization scenario.
- **Improvements:** 
   - Context is plain; could indicate which isomerization or add a mini-reaction (e.g., "conversion of glucose to fructose").
   - Ensure unnecessary values (like T or R) are not repeated if already clear.

**Actionable Feedback:**  
Specify a named system, e.g., "glucose to fructose," to ground it. Otherwise, excellent.

---

### 4. Arrhenius Pre-Exponential Factor $A$
**Critique:**
- **Strengths:** Laboratory context (hydrogen peroxide), simple calculation, concise, single step.
- **Improvements:** 
   - "Estimate" is fine, but you could clarify "calculate" if no data is uncertain.
   - Could mention a brief scenario (e.g., "in a typical lab titration of...").

**Actionable Feedback:**  
Add a short reason for measuring A (e.g., "to compare with literature pre-exponential factors").

---

### 5. IUPAC Name of 5-Membered Oxonium Cyclization
**Critique:**
- **Strengths:** Unique, nomenclature-focused.
- **Improvements:**
   - The scenario is advanced and assumes specific knowledge; not easily contextualizable for all audiences.
   - Not directly an "everyday" or standard lab case; could frame as a synthetic intermediate in a common glycosylation.
   - Ensure only one compound fits the description and that the IUPAC requirements are clear.

**Actionable Feedback:**  
Frame as "Identify the full IUPAC name for the intermediate formed during benzylidene-protected glucose glycosylation..." for relatable context. Ensure stereochemistry requirements are specific (e.g., drawn structure or Fischer template reference).

---

### 6. Glycosylation: kα/kβ Ratio from ΔΔG‡
**Critique:**
- **Strengths:** Lab reaction context, concise, expects single number.
- **Improvements:**
   - Requires prior calculation of $k_\alpha$, so not a "simple" single formula calculation—must first reference calculated $k_\beta$ from $\Delta G^{\ddagger}_\beta$, then take the ratio.
   - Slightly chain calculation.
   - Context could be more vivid (specific protecting groups, donor/acceptor).

**Actionable Feedback:**  
Ask only for the ratio from ΔΔG‡, or else explicitly give the pre-exponential factor or $k_\alpha/k_\beta$ and require only one calculation step. Specify a more distinct glycosylation context.

---

### 7. Calculate ΔΔG‡ from Observed Selectivity Ratio
**Critique:**
- **Strengths:** Standard approach, clear formula.
- **Improvements:**
   - Scenario is generic; specify the system where the ratio is observed.
   - Slight redundancy with Q2 and Q8.

**Actionable Feedback:**  
Anchor to a real or named glycosylation, and avoid repeating selectivity calculations across multiple questions.

---

### 8. Selectivity Ratio from ΔΔG‡ (again)
**Critique:**
- **Strengths:** Concise, single answer.
- **Improvements:**
   - Redundant with Q2 and Q7.
   - Too general; reuse of context dilutes uniqueness.

**Actionable Feedback:**  
Remove as near-duplicate or combine with variations for a more nuanced single question.

---

### 9. Gibbs Activation Energy Calculation
**Critique:**
- **Strengths:** Concise, formulaic, SI units, one step.
- **Improvements:**
   - Scenario could be normalized to a real/recognizable reaction (e.g., in SN1 hydrolysis).
   - Otherwise fits well to the guidelines.

**Actionable Feedback:**  
Add a specific reaction context or note why determining $\Delta G^{\ddagger}$ is relevant (e.g., correlating with observed rates).

---

### 10. Bicyclic Oxonium IUPAC Name
**Critique:**
- **Strengths:** Unique nomenclature challenge, clear structure.
- **Improvements:**
   - Less "everyday" lab scenario, could contextualize as a mechanism intermediate during a classic glycosylation.
   - Wording is dense and assumes expertise; not easily accessible for students not specializing in carbohydrate chemistry.

**Actionable Feedback:**  
Frame as: "Provide the full IUPAC name for the predicted bicyclic oxonium intermediate in the [specific reaction/mechanism] of..." for clarity, specifying why and where such intermediates are relevant.

---

## **Global Summary**
- **Model Fresh, Realistic Contexts:** Several questions are generic; infuse with named reactions, enzymes, or explicit lab contexts.
- **Single Direct Calculation Only:** Q6 is a chain calculation (must do two steps). All others mostly fit this.
- **Eliminate Redundant Questions:** Q2, 7, 8 are essentially the same problem; keep only the strongest/most uniquely framed.
- **Nomenclature Questions:** Good attempt at uniqueness, but consider accessibility and briefly state relevance/mechanistic context.
- **Consistency:** Units, language, and instructions are generally good.
- **Clarity:** Wording is technical/professional, but aim for precision, especially in nomenclature/structure descriptions to avoid ambiguity.

---

### **General Action Points**
1. **Make contexts more specific and realistic.**
2. **Cut all redundant or near-duplicate questions.**
3. **Enforce a single-step calculation per question.**
4. **Justify any advanced/nomenclature task with a reaction/mechanistic scenario.**
5. **Ensure there is only one valid final answer (avoid chain steps).**
6. **Tighten language—avoid unnecessary extra info.**
