Here are five novel master's chemistry questions, adhering to the specified guidelines:

1.  <question> DNA-PKcs phosphorylation stoichiometry in NHEJ.

    Following a double-strand break, DNA-PKcs undergoes autophosphorylation. Assume that each DNA-PKcs molecule ($M_r$ = 469 kDa) can incorporate a maximum of $n$ phosphate groups ($M_r$ = 80 Da each) before dissociation. If a purified DNA-PKcs sample shows a phosphate incorporation of 2.40 mg of phosphate per 10.0 mg of protein, calculate the average number, $n$, of phosphate groups added to each DNA-PKcs molecule, assuming complete phosphorylation of only DNA-PKcs.</question>

2.  <question> DNA end bridging energetics by Ku heterodimer.

    The Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer, a key component of DNA-PK, binds to DNA double-strand breaks. Assume Ku binding is driven by electrostatic interactions. If the binding affinity ($K_d$) of Ku to a DNA end is 10 pM at 298 K in a buffer with 100 mM NaCl and decreases tenfold (to 100 pM) when the NaCl concentration is increased to 200 mM, estimate the change in the Gibbs free energy of binding ($\Delta G$) in kJ/mol due to the increased ionic strength. Assume the temperature remains constant.</question>

3.  <question> DNA-PKcs kinase activity inhibition.

    Compound X is a potent inhibitor of DNA-PKcs kinase activity. The $IC_{50}$ value of compound X for DNA-PKcs is determined to be 5.0 nM. If the concentration of DNA-PKcs in an in vitro kinase assay is 2.0 nM, calculate the concentration of compound X (in nM) required to inhibit the kinase activity by 80%, assuming simple competitive inhibition and the Michaelis-Menten constant ($K_m$) of the substrate is much larger than the enzyme concentration.</question>

4.  <question> Conformational change of DNA-PK upon DNA binding.

    DNA-PK undergoes a conformational change upon binding to DNA, increasing its hydrodynamic radius ($R_h$). Initially, the DNA-PK complex has $R_{h1}$ = 10 nm. After DNA binding, the radius increases to $R_{h2}$ = 14 nm. If the diffusion coefficient ($D$) is inversely proportional to $R_h$ ($D = k_B T / (6 \pi \eta R_h)$), where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature, and $\eta$ is the solvent viscosity, determine the percentage decrease in the diffusion coefficient (%) of DNA-PK upon DNA binding, assuming all other factors remain constant.</question>

5.  <question> Synthesis of a DNA-PKcs inhibitor precursor.

    A key intermediate in the synthesis of a DNA-PKcs inhibitor is formed through a Diels-Alder reaction. Reacting 1.00 g of 1,3-butadiene with 1.50 g of maleic anhydride yields the desired cycloadduct. If the reaction proceeds with 75% yield, calculate the mass of the cycloadduct (in grams) obtained, assuming only the reactants 1,3-butadiene and maleic anhydride were reacted in the synthesis.
    (Molar mass of 1,3-butadiene: 54.09 g/mol; Molar mass of maleic anhydride: 98.06 g/mol; Molar mass of cycloadduct: 152.15 g/mol).</question>

**Question 2: DNA end bridging energetics by Ku heterodimer.**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Chemistry Scenario):** Excellent. Models protein-DNA binding energetics and the effect of ionic strength, a common physical chemistry/biophysical concept.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Correct. Expects a numerical value for $\Delta G$.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes. Requires relating $K_d$ to $\Delta G$ for two conditions and calculating the difference.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid Redundancy):** No significant redundancy. All information is relevant for the calculation or context.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Good. Applies thermodynamics to a specific biological binding event and the effect of ionic strength, making it more advanced than basic $\Delta G$ calculations.

**Question 3: DNA-PKcs kinase activity inhibition.**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Chemistry Scenario):** Good. Enzyme kinetics and inhibition are core biochemical topics.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Correct. Expects a numerical value for concentration.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Weakness.** As currently phrased, if the given $IC_{50}$ ($5.0$ nM) is assumed to be the effective $IC_{50}$ under the assay conditions, the calculation is a single algebraic step using $E_I/E_0 = 1 / (1 + [I]/IC_{50})$, which is too simplistic for a Master's question. If the intention was to calculate $K_i$ first from $IC_{50} = K_i(1 + [S]/K_m)$, then the question is **unsolvable** as the substrate concentration ($[S]$) and $K_m$ are not provided.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid Redundancy):** **Weakness.** The information "concentration of DNA-PKcs in an in vitro kinase assay is $2.0$ nM" and "the Michaelis-Menten constant ($K_m$) of the substrate is much larger than the enzyme concentration" is extraneous and potentially misleading without further context or parameters. For simple competitive inhibition calculations, the enzyme concentration is usually not needed, and the $K_m$ comparison to enzyme concentration is unusual.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Calculations involving $IC_{50}$ are standard. The context is good, but the calculation itself is either too simple or impossible without clarification.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes, if interpreted simply.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** Okay, but the phrase "$K_m$ of the substrate is much larger than the enzyme concentration" is not standard and confusing.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Avoid Colloquial/Ambiguous):** **Weakness.** "$K_m$ of the substrate is much larger than the enzyme concentration" is ambiguous and biologically atypical phrasing; $K_m$ is typically compared to substrate concentration.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units/Nomenclature):** Consistent.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 11 (LaTeX Formatting):** Correctly applied.

*   **Actionable Feedback:** This question needs significant revision to be suitable for a Master's level.
    1.  **To force multi-step reasoning:** Explicitly state the substrate concentration ($[S]$) and the $K_m$ for the substrate. Then, clarify whether the given $IC_{50}$ is the $K_i$ or an $IC_{50}$ determined at a specific substrate concentration. This allows students to calculate $K_i$ or adjust the $IC_{50}$ for the assay conditions.
    2.  **To remove redundancy/ambiguity:** If the intention is for students to directly use the given $IC_{50}$ for the calculation, remove the information about enzyme concentration and $K_m$ (or rephrase the $K_m$ comparison to be relevant, e.g., $K_m \gg [S]$ if it means $IC_{50} \approx K_i$). However, this might make the question too simple for Master's.

**Question 4: Conformational change of DNA-PK upon DNA binding.**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Chemistry Scenario):** Excellent. Models a biophysical phenomenon (conformational change affecting diffusion) using a fundamental physical chemistry principle (Stokes-Einstein equation).
    *   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Correct. Expects a numerical percentage decrease.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes. Requires understanding the inverse proportionality and calculating a percentage change.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid Redundancy):** No redundancy. All parameters and caveats ("assuming all other factors remain constant") are necessary.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Very good. Applies the Stokes-Einstein equation to a biological macromolecule's conformational change, which is a nuanced application.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Avoid Colloquial/Ambiguous):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units/Nomenclature):** Consistent and appropriate.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Yes.

**Question 5: Synthesis of a DNA-PKcs inhibitor precursor.**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Chemistry Scenario):** Good. Models a synthetic organic reaction with a practical yield calculation.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Correct. Expects a numerical mass.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes. Requires calculating moles, identifying a limiting reactant, determining theoretical yield, and applying a percentage yield.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid Redundancy):** Minor redundancy. "assuming only the reactants 1,3-butadiene and maleic anhydride were reacted in the synthesis" is implied by the reaction description.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Good. While limiting reactant/yield calculations are standard, applying it to a specific reaction like Diels-Alder in the context of an inhibitor precursor provides a degree of novelty. For a Master's level, one might expect a slightly more complex organic problem (e.g., stereochemistry, mechanism, retrosynthetic analysis), but this is acceptable as a quantitative problem.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Avoid Colloquial/Ambiguous):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units/Nomenclature):** Consistent and appropriate. Uses common names for reactants, which is acceptable in this context.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 11 (LaTeX Formatting):** Correctly applied.

*   **Actionable Feedback:** This is a strong question.
    1.  Consider removing the slightly redundant phrase: "assuming only the reactants 1,3-butadiene and maleic anhydride were reacted in the synthesis."
    2.  For even greater "uniqueness" at the Master's level, the question could potentially incorporate an element of stereochemistry (e.g., asking for the major diastereomer and explaining why) or a brief mechanistic inquiry if the scenario allows for it, though the current quantitative problem is perfectly valid.

---

**Overall Summary:**

The questions are generally well-designed, incorporating real-world biological contexts into chemistry problems. Questions 1, 2, and 4 are particularly strong, meeting almost all guidelines effectively. Question 5 is also very good, representing a solid quantitative organic chemistry problem. Question 3 is the weakest due to ambiguity and potential lack of appropriate multi-step complexity for a Master's level given the provided information.

**Overall Summary and Recommendation:**

The content and intellectual challenge of these questions are high and align very well with most of your guidelines, particularly those related to scenario modeling, multi-step reasoning, uniqueness, and clarity. They demonstrate a strong understanding of relevant chemistry and biology concepts.

**The most prominent and consistent area for improvement across all questions is Guideline 11: Solution Formatting.** Every numerical value, unit, and variable should be enclosed within LaTeX `$...$` for inline math. For chemical names that are part of the textual description but contain numbers or should be treated like variables (e.g., "1,3-butadiene"), use `$\text{1,3-butadiene}$` to ensure proper typesetting within the math environment. Adhering to this will significantly enhance the rigor and professional presentation of your assessment.

**Question 1: DNA-PKcs phosphorylation stoichiometry in NHEJ.**
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model Chemistry Scenario):** Effectively models a relevant biochemical process (autophosphorylation).
    *   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Requires multi-step calculation involving unit conversions and molar ratios.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Unique/Complex):** Applies stoichiometry to a high-molecular-weight biological system, making it more specific than a generic textbook problem.
    *   Meets Guidelines 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 well.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Guideline 11 (LaTeX Formatting):** Numbers and variables are not consistently formatted using LaTeX inline math. For example, `$M_r = 469\text{ kDa}$` should be `$M_r = 469\text{ kDa}$`, and `$2.40\text{ mg}$` should be `$2.40\text{ mg}$`.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Ensure all numerical values, units, and variables (e.g., $M_r$, $n$) are consistently enclosed in LaTeX inline math mode (`$...$`).

**Question 2: DNA end bridging energetics by Ku heterodimer.**
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model Chemistry Scenario):** Models a specific biochemical binding event and its thermodynamics.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Requires calculating Gibbs free energy from $K_d$ at two conditions and then determining the difference.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Unique/Complex):** Relates binding affinity to ionic strength, adding a layer of biophysical complexity beyond a simple $\Delta G$ calculation.
    *   Meets Guidelines 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 well.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Guideline 11 (LaTeX Formatting):** Numbers and variables are not consistently formatted using LaTeX inline math. For example, `$K_d$` should be `$K_d$`, `$10\text{ pM}$` should be `$10\text{ pM}$`, and `$298\text{ K}$` should be `$298\text{ K}$`.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Apply consistent LaTeX inline math formatting for all numbers, units, and variables throughout the question, e.g., `$10\text{ pM}$` and `$100\text{ mM NaCl}$`.

**Question 3: DNA-PKcs kinase activity inhibition.**
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model Chemistry Scenario):** Models enzyme kinetics and inhibition in a relevant biological context.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Requires knowledge of enzyme inhibition kinetics, likely involving the Cheng-Prusoff equation or related principles to determine inhibitor concentration for a specific inhibition percentage.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Unique/Complex):** It's a specific application of enzyme kinetics, moving beyond basic rate law problems.
    *   Meets Guidelines 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 well.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Guideline 11 (LaTeX Formatting):** Numbers and variables are not consistently formatted using LaTeX inline math. For instance, `$IC_{50}$` should be `$IC_{50}$`, `$5.0\text{ nM}$` should be `$5.0\text{ nM}$`, and `$K_m$` should be `$K_m$`.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Enclose all numerical values, percentages, units, and variables (e.g., $IC_{50}$, $K_m$) within LaTeX inline math delimiters (`$...$`).

**Question 4: Conformational change of DNA-PK upon DNA binding.**
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Meets all guidelines (1-11) exceptionally well.**
    *   The scenario is clear, calculation is multi-step, no redundancy, unique application of diffusion principles, single solution, rigorous phrasing, no ambiguity, consistent units, single part, and **perfect LaTeX formatting**.
*   **Weaknesses:** None.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** No improvements needed for this question; it serves as an excellent example.

**Question 5: Synthesis of a DNA-PKcs inhibitor precursor.**
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model Chemistry Scenario):** Models a synthetic organic reaction.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Requires limiting reactant calculation, theoretical yield, and actual yield.
    *   Meets Guidelines 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 well.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Guideline 5 (Unique/Complex):** This is a very standard limiting reactant and percent yield problem commonly found in introductory chemistry textbooks. It lacks the "originality and complexity" expected.
    *   **Guideline 11 (LaTeX Formatting):** Numbers and percentages are not consistently formatted using LaTeX inline math. For instance, `$1.00\text{ g}$` should be `$1.00\text{ g}$` and `$75\%$ yield` should be `$75\%$ yield`.
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    1.  **To enhance complexity (Guideline 5):** Consider adding an element that goes beyond basic stoichiometry, such as a purification step with associated recovery, a discussion of stereochemistry (relevant for Diels-Alder), or requiring the drawing/identification of the product based on reaction principles, rather than just using a given molar mass.
    2.  Ensure all numerical values and percentages are consistently enclosed in LaTeX inline math (`$...$`).

<question> DNA-PKcs phosphorylation stoichiometry in NHEJ.

Following a double-strand break, DNA-PKcs undergoes autophosphorylation. Assume that each DNA-PKcs molecule ($M_r = 469 \text{ kDa}$) can incorporate a maximum of $n$ phosphate groups ($M_r = 80 \text{ Da}$ each) before dissociation. If a purified DNA-PKcs sample shows a phosphate incorporation of $2.40 \text{ mg}$ of phosphate per $10.0 \text{ mg}$ of protein, calculate the average number, $n$, of phosphate groups added to each DNA-PKcs molecule, assuming complete phosphorylation of only DNA-PKcs.</question>

<question> DNA end bridging energetics by Ku heterodimer.

The Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer, a key component of DNA-PK, binds to DNA double-strand breaks. Assume Ku binding is driven by electrostatic interactions. If the binding affinity ($K_d$) of Ku to a DNA end is $10 \text{ pM}$ at $298 \text{ K}$ in a buffer with $100 \text{ mM NaCl}$ and decreases tenfold (to $100 \text{ pM}$) when the NaCl concentration is increased to $200 \text{ mM}$, estimate the change in the Gibbs free energy of binding ($\Delta G$) in $\text{kJ/mol}$ due to the increased ionic strength. Assume the temperature remains constant. You may use $R = 8.314 \text{ J/(mol K)}$.</question>

<question> DNA-PKcs kinase activity inhibition.

Compound X is a potent inhibitor of DNA-PKcs kinase activity. The $IC_{50}$ value of compound X for DNA-PKcs is determined to be $5.0 \text{ nM}$ in an in vitro kinase assay where the substrate concentration is $100 \text{ μM}$ and the $K_m$ for the substrate is $50 \text{ μM}$. Assuming simple competitive inhibition, calculate the concentration of compound X (in $\text{nM}$) required to inhibit the kinase activity by $80\%$ under these assay conditions.</question>

<question> Conformational change of DNA-PK upon DNA binding.

DNA-PK undergoes a conformational change upon binding to DNA, increasing its hydrodynamic radius ($R_h$). Initially, the DNA-PK complex has $R_{h1} = 10 \text{ nm}$. After DNA binding, the radius increases to $R_{h2} = 14 \text{ nm}$. If the diffusion coefficient ($D$) is inversely proportional to $R_h$ ($D = k_B T / (6 \pi \eta R_h)$), where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature, and $\eta$ is the solvent viscosity, determine the percentage decrease in the diffusion coefficient ($\%$) of DNA-PK upon DNA binding, assuming all other factors remain constant.</question>

<question> Synthesis of a DNA-PKcs inhibitor precursor.

A key intermediate in the synthesis of a DNA-PKcs inhibitor is formed through a Diels-Alder reaction. Reacting $1.00 \text{ g}$ of $\text{1,3-butadiene}$ with $1.50 \text{ g}$ of $\text{maleic anhydride}$ yields the desired cycloadduct. After the reaction, the product is purified by recrystallization.  Assume that $10\%$ of the product is lost during the recrystallization process. If the initial Diels-Alder reaction proceeds with $75\%$ yield, calculate the mass of the purified cycloadduct (in grams) obtained. Provide the *IUPAC name* of the cycloadduct.
    (Molar mass of $\text{1,3-butadiene}$: $54.09 \text{ g/mol}$; Molar mass of $\text{maleic anhydride}$: $98.06 \text{ g/mol}$; Molar mass of cycloadduct: $152.15 \text{ g/mol}$).</question>
