### Question 1

**Strengths:**  
- Presents a realistic scenario with inline FTIR monitoring.
- Includes specific data for calculation; answer is a single numerical value with units.

**Improvements:**  
- **Clarity:** Specify that Beer's Law ($A=\epsilon \ell c$) is being used, and clarify that the "calibration slope" is the molar absorptivity ($\epsilon$).
- **Redundancy:** The phrase "spectral absorbance ... is related linearly" is implicit; can be omitted.
- **IUPAC:** ‘Benzyl alcohol’ is an accepted name—no problem here.

#### Suggested Revision:  
> In an inline FTIR-monitored continuous reactor, the conversion of benzyl chloride to benzyl alcohol is tracked using absorbance at $1100~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, corresponding to the C–O stretch. The molar absorptivity at this wavelength is $4.25~\mathrm{L}\cdot\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\cdot\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, and the path length is $0.2~\mathrm{cm}$. If the absorbance reads $0.85$, calculate the benzyl alcohol concentration in $\mathrm{mol}\cdot\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ at that instant.

---

### Question 2

**Strengths:**  
- Applies Raman spectroscopy quantitatively to reaction monitoring.
- Expects a single value as answer.

**Improvements:**  
- **Redundancy:** The specification "zero order in product" is superfluous unless mechanistically justified since the product doesn't appear in the rate law for first-order decay.
- **Ambiguity:** It says “intensity ratio of product to reactant bands," but for a first-order disappearance of reactant, just focus on reactant.
- **Units:** It should clarify if band intensities are directly convertible to concentrations, reinforcing proportionality.
- **Clarity:** Could directly prompt for reactant concentration—avoid potential confusion with ratios.

#### Suggested Revision:  
> In a chemical process monitored by Raman spectroscopy, the intensity ratio of product to reactant characteristic bands is $3.75$ at $25~{}^\circ\mathrm{C}$. The reaction follows first-order kinetics in the reactant, with an initial reactant concentration of $1.5~\mathrm{mol}\cdot\mathrm{L}^{-1}$. Assuming Raman band intensities are directly proportional to molar concentrations, calculate the current concentration of the reactant in $\mathrm{mol}\cdot\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.

---

### Question 3

**Strengths:**  
- Integrates HPLC calibration into the estimation.
- Requires multi-step reasoning and yields a single numerical result.

**Improvements:**  
- **Conciseness:** The phrase "insertion concentration" is unclear; specify "calculated concentration."
- **Ambiguity:** Avoid "DILCTM" unless it's strictly relevant; otherwise, omit for clarity.
- **Typo:** "insertion concentration" is likely a typo; use "instantaneous" or "measured" concentration.

#### Suggested Revision:  
> In an inline HPLC analysis of an esterification reaction producing ethyl acetate, the calibration curve is $C = mA + b$, where $C$ is the concentration in $\mathrm{mol}\cdot\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ and $A$ is the chromatographic peak area. Given $m = 2.80 \times 10^{-5}~\mathrm{mol}\cdot\mathrm{L}^{-1}\cdot\text{unit}^{-1}$, $b = 1.2 \times 10^{-4}~\mathrm{mol}\cdot\mathrm{L}^{-1}$, and a measured peak area of $1800$ units, calculate the concentration of ethyl acetate in $\mathrm{mol}\cdot\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.

---

### Question 4

**Strengths:**  
- Multi-step: Calculating both current concentration using Beer's Law, then conversion percentage.

**Improvements:**  
- **Rigorous Phrasing:** "Utilizing the decrease" can be rephrased as "monitored via the decrease".
- **Units:** Check that absorbance is dimensionless, and all constants are given in compatible units.
- **Clarity:** State explicitly that conversion percentage means fraction reacted, not remaining.

#### Suggested Revision:  
> An FTIR probe monitors the conversion of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde to 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol, tracking the decreasing absorbance at $1695~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Given a path length of $0.15~\mathrm{cm}$, a molar absorptivity of $120~\mathrm{L}\cdot\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\cdot\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, and an initial 4-nitrobenzaldehyde concentration of $0.025~\mathrm{mol}\cdot\mathrm{L}^{-1}$, calculate the percentage conversion if the current absorbance is $0.9$.

---

### Question 5

**Strengths:**  
- Demands understanding and application of Arrhenius equation.

**Improvements:**  
- **Redundancy:** "Derived from real-time kinetic data" is extraneous.
- **Units:** Explicitly state units of $R$.
- **Conciseness:** Remove parenthetical clarifications.

#### Suggested Revision:  
> The activation energy for a catalytic hydrogenation reaction is $75~\mathrm{kJ}\cdot\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. Using the Arrhenius equation and $R = 8.314~\mathrm{J}\cdot\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\cdot\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, calculate the ratio of rate constants $k_{310}/k_{290}$ at $310~\mathrm{K}$ and $290~\mathrm{K}$, respectively.

---

### Question 6

**Strengths:**  
- Integrates decay data and asks for first-order rate constant, forcing a multi-step calculation.

**Improvements:**  
- **Units:** Specify to give $k_\text{obs}$ in $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.
- **Conciseness:** "Raman band intensity of the reactant drops from..." is sufficient; don’t restate half-life unless relevant to the calculation.

#### Suggested Revision:  
> In a continuous stirred-tank reactor, the pseudo-first-order decay of a reactant monitored by Raman spectroscopy yields a decrease in band intensity from $1.00$ to $0.35$ over $20~\mathrm{minutes}$ at $298~\mathrm{K}$. Calculate the observed rate constant $k_\text{obs}$ in $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, assuming intensity is directly proportional to concentration.

---

### Question 7

**Strengths:**  
- Requires use of rate law and steady-state data to extract $k$.

**Improvements:**  
- **Clarity:** Clearly specify at what time the rate is measured.
- **Conciseness:** "DILCTM" likely unnecessary unless a key element.
- **Units:** Be explicit that $k$ is to be reported in $\mathrm{L}^2\cdot\mathrm{mol}^{-2}\cdot\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

#### Suggested Revision:  
> At $t = 200~\mathrm{s}$ in a reaction where the intermediate concentration is increasing at $9.0\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{mol}\cdot\mathrm{L}^{-1}\cdot\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, the concentrations are $[A] = 0.012~\mathrm{mol}\cdot\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ and $[B] = 0.020~\mathrm{mol}\cdot\mathrm{L}^{-1}$. The rate law is $r = k [A]^2 [B]$. Calculate the rate constant $k$ in $\mathrm{L}^2\cdot\mathrm{mol}^{-2}\cdot\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

---

### Question 8

**Strengths:**  
- Focuses on first-order decay and time required for a given concentration drop.

**Improvements:**  
- **Redundancy:** "decreases exponentially" is evident in first-order decay.
- **Clarity:** Only need $k$ and initial/final concentrations and prompt for elapsed time.

#### Suggested Revision:  
> For a first-order esterification reaction with $k = 4.2\times10^{-4}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at $350~\mathrm{K}$, how long does it take for the acid concentration to decrease from $0.10~\mathrm{mol}\cdot\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ to $0.020~\mathrm{mol}\cdot\mathrm{L}^{-1}$?

---

### Question 9

**Strengths:**  
- Asks for $\epsilon$ from absorbance and calibrated concentration; uses real-world cross-calibration.

**Improvements:**  
- **Ambiguity:** "PAT-enabled process optimization" and "DILCTM" can be omitted for clarity and conciseness.
- **Clarity:** All necessary terms are well defined.

#### Suggested Revision:  
> In an FTIR measurement using a path length of $0.1~\mathrm{cm}$, absorbance at $1700~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is $0.66$. An HPLC analysis confirms the actual concentration is $0.008~\mathrm{mol}\cdot\mathrm{L}^{-1}$. Calculate the molar absorptivity $\epsilon$ in $\mathrm{L}\cdot\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\cdot\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.

- **Good:** Real-world scenario, clear FTIR context, all necessary data provided, single numerical solution.
- **Improvements:**  
  - None needed; this is rigorous, requires applying Beer-Lambert Law.
  - The IR band assignment for C–O stretch is plausible and not overstandard.

#### Question 2: Raman Spectroscopy, Band Intensity Ratio, First-Order Kinetics

- **Good:** Unique; combination of spectroscopy and kinetics calculation is seldom found in textbooks.
- **Improvements:**  
  - To force explicit multi-step reasoning, state "show your steps" or be explicit that [product]/[reactant] = intensity ratio, which the student must connect to the reactant concentration.
  - Units are fine; context is clear.

#### Question 3: HPLC Calibration Curve

- **Good:** Realistic (HPLC calibration), asks for a specific calculation.
- **Improvements:**
  - "unit" for chromatographic peak area should be clarified or replaced (e.g., "arbitrary units" or "integrated peak area units").
  - Otherwise, concise and focused.

#### Question 4: FTIR Percent Conversion Calculation

- **Good:** Interesting; asks for percent conversion using absorbance data, multistep.
- **Improvements:**
  - Make sure “percentage conversion” is clearly defined (should be percent decrease in original absorbance, which they must calculate given $A_0$ from the initial concentration).
  - Precise; no superfluous data.

#### Question 5: Arrhenius Equation, Rate Constant Ratio

- **Good:** Context is clear; asks specifically for the $k_{310}/k_{290}$ ratio.
- **Improvements:**
  - Straightforward, but perhaps a bit too single-step (plug-and-chug).
  - Could be made more contextual (e.g., "how much does the catalyst speed up the reaction at the higher temperature?").
  - Otherwise, precise, with correct LaTeX.

#### Question 6: CSTR, Pseudo-First-Order with Raman Intensity

- **Good:** Unique (Raman intensities as concentration proxy, real kinetic monitoring context).  
- **Improvements:**
  - Could clarify that "band intensity" refers to that of the reactant.
  - Otherwise, clear single-answer calculation.

#### Question 7: Rate Constant from Intermediate Formation Rate

- **Good:** Multistep (must work back from $d[\mathrm{intermediate}]/dt$).
- **Improvements:**
  - Could clarify: Is intermediate formation rate equal to overall reaction rate? (Fine if so, but could explicitly state "assuming the rate of intermediate accumulation equals the rate of reaction").
  - Units for $k$ are correct for third order.

#### Question 8: First-Order Kinetics, Time for Concentration Decrease

- **Good:** Standard, but not too “textbook” (contextualizes with esterification).
- **Improvements:**
  - Could specify which acid or just say "reactant" for generality, but fine as is.

#### Question 9: FTIR Molar Absorptivity Calculation

- **Good:** Provides calibration context; asks for $\epsilon$.
- **Improvements:**
  - "Measured absorbance" and "known concentration" are both relevant; could add "assuming Beer's Law applies".
  - Units explicit and correct.

### General Suggestions

1. **Force More Multistep Reasoning in Some Cases:**  
   A few questions (5, 8, 9) are essentially direct plug-and-chug — consider requiring additional interpretation, e.g., ask students to infer missing variables before the calculation.

2. **Precise Nomenclature:**  
   Ensure all chemicals, if named, use full IUPAC names (they do here).

3. **Units for HPLC Peak Area:**  
   Explicitly state the area units or clarify if "unit" means "area count from detector".

4. **Avoid Potential Ambiguity:**  
   Define “intensity,” “absorbance”, or “peak area” if there’s any risk of confusion. These are mostly clear, so this is a minor issue.

5. **Question Focus:**  
   All questions have a single solution path, so they are not multipart or ambiguous.

6. **Math Formatting:**  
   All equations presented with $...$ (inline) in LaTeX are correct for Markdown.

### **Actionable General Guidelines for Improvement:**

- Add clarifications on units ("units" for HPLC peak area).
- For questions relying on measured “intensity” or “absorbance,” clarify the connection to concentration for non-experts.
- Make certain questions force explicit multi-step reasoning (avoid easy plug-and-chug by asking students to extract an intermediate variable).
- Always define any calculated term (e.g., "percentage conversion") upon first use.
- Where appropriate, require stating any assumptions being made (e.g., that rate of intermediate increase equals overall reaction rate).

**Overall:**  
These questions largely meet the stated guidelines, are original, and show advanced, context-rich scenarios. With minor clarifications and small adjustments to some questions to increase multi-step reasoning, they will be exemplary.

In an inline FTIR-monitored continuous reactor, the conversion of benzyl chloride to benzyl alcohol is tracked using absorbance at $1100~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, corresponding to the C–O stretch. The molar absorptivity at this wavelength is $4.25~\mathrm{L}\cdot\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\cdot\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, and the path length is $0.2~\mathrm{cm}$.

<question>  
In a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR), the pseudo-first-order decay of a reactant is monitored by Raman spectroscopy.
