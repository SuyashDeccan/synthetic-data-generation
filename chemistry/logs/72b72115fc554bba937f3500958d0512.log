Here are five novel chemistry questions based on your specifications:

1. <question> Enzyme-Constrained Model Adjustment with Incomplete Data:

Consider an *E. coli* metabolic model constrained by enzyme levels. The model contains a reaction catalyzed by alanine transaminase (EC 2.6.1.2). The literature $k_{cat}$ value for the *E. coli* alanine transaminase is $50 \, s^{-1}$. However, the measured flux through the transaminase reaction in a specific experiment is $0.8 \, mmol \, gDW^{-1} \, hr^{-1}$, and the measured enzyme concentration is $2 \, \mu mol \, gDW^{-1}$. Calculate the adjusted turnover number ($k_{adj}$, in $s^{-1}$) for alanine transaminase that would make the model consistent with the experimental data. Assume that the $k_{adj}$ is the only parameter to be adjusted.</question>

2. <question> Probabilistic Metabolic Optimization for Glycerol Production:

A genetically engineered *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* strain is designed for glycerol production under anaerobic conditions. Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) predicts a maximum glycerol production rate of $3.5 \, mmol \, gDW^{-1} \, hr^{-1}$. Probabilistic Metabolic Optimization (PMO) is implemented to account for uncertainties in the metabolic network. PMO results in a probability distribution of glycerol production rates. The 95% confidence interval lower bound for the glycerol production rate, obtained from PMO, is $2.8 \, mmol \, gDW^{-1} \, hr^{-1}$. Calculate the percentage decrease in the predicted glycerol production rate when considering the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval from PMO, relative to the FBA prediction.</question>

3. <question> Multi-Enzyme Pathway Flux Matching:

A simplified metabolic pathway consists of two consecutive enzymatic reactions:

Reaction 1: A $\xrightarrow{E1}$ B
Reaction 2: B $\xrightarrow{E2}$ C

The enzyme E1 has a turnover number of $k_{cat,1} = 100 \, s^{-1}$ and E2 has a turnover number of $k_{cat,2} = 60 \, s^{-1}$. The steady-state concentration of enzyme E1 is measured to be $0.5 \, \mu mol \, gDW^{-1}$. Assuming that the flux through both reactions is equal at steady state, determine the required concentration of enzyme E2 (in $\mu mol \, gDW^{-1}$) to maintain this flux equality.</question>

4. <question> Adjusted Turnover Parameter Impact on Flux Distribution:

A metabolic model of *Bacillus subtilis* contains a reaction catalyzed by citrate synthase (EC 2.3.3.1). Initial Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) simulation using literature $k_{cat}$ values leads to a predicted flux of $5.0 \, mmol \, gDW^{-1} \, hr^{-1}$ through the citrate synthase reaction. After incorporating proteomic data, the adjusted turnover number for citrate synthase ($k_{adj}$) is determined to be 75% of the original literature value. Recalculate the flux through the citrate synthase reaction (in $mmol \, gDW^{-1} \, hr^{-1}$) in the FBA model using the adjusted turnover number, assuming enzyme concentrations are unchanged and citrate synthase is flux limiting under both simulations.</question>

5. <question> Integrating Enzyme Constraints with Substrate Uptake Rates:

Consider a simplified metabolic model with a single substrate uptake reaction and one metabolic pathway. The maximum substrate uptake rate is experimentally determined to be $10 \, mmol \, gDW^{-1} \, hr^{-1}$. The metabolic pathway contains one enzymatic reaction, catalyzed by enzyme X, with a turnover number of $k_{cat} = 80 \, s^{-1}$. Assume that all the substrate taken up is processed through the enzyme X reaction. Determine the minimum enzyme concentration of X (in $\mu mol \, gDW^{-1}$) required to sustain the maximum substrate uptake rate. Ensure that all units are converted to match correctly.</question>

Here's a critique of each question against your guidelines, followed by actionable feedback:

---

**General Strengths Across Questions:**
*   **Novelty & Complexity:** The questions are genuinely novel and move beyond standard textbook examples, delving into quantitative aspects of systems biochemistry and metabolic modeling, which is excellent.
*   **Real-world Scenario:** They successfully model idealized but realistic biochemical scenarios.
*   **Numerical Answers:** They clearly expect numerical answers with specific units.
*   **Multi-step Reasoning:** All questions require at least two steps: unit conversion and algebraic manipulation, satisfying the multi-step requirement.
*   **Single Solution:** Each question has a single, unambiguous correct answer.
*   **Rigorous and Concise Phrasing:** The language is formal, precise, and avoids colloquialisms.

---

**Critique of Individual Questions:**

1.  **Enzyme-Constrained Model Adjustment with Incomplete Data**
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid Redundancy):** **Critique:** Contains extraneous information. The literature $k_{cat}$ value ($50 \, s^{-1}$) is not needed for calculating the adjusted $k_{adj}$ based on the experimental flux and enzyme concentration. This can be a distractor.
    *   **Guideline 11 (Solution Formatting):** **Critique:** Fails. No LaTeX formatting is used for numbers, variables, or units.

2.  **Probabilistic Metabolic Optimization for Glycerol Production**
    *   **Guideline 11 (Solution Formatting):** **Critique:** Fails. No LaTeX formatting is used for numbers, variables, or units.

3.  **Multi-Enzyme Pathway Flux Matching**
    *   **Guideline 11 (Solution Formatting):** **Critique:** Fails. No LaTeX formatting is used for numbers, variables, or units.

4.  **Adjusted Turnover Parameter Impact on Flux Distribution**
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Critique:** While technically multi-step (conceptual understanding of proportionality, then multiplication), the calculation itself is a single multiplication. The problem relies heavily on the specific clarifying assumption ("citrate synthase is flux limiting under both simulations") to enable this direct proportionality, which might be a bit simplistic for a complex FBA model and could potentially be misunderstood if the student doesn't grasp that specific implication.
    *   **Guideline 11 (Solution Formatting):** **Critique:** Fails. No LaTeX formatting is used for numbers, variables, or units.

5.  **Integrating Enzyme Constraints with Substrate Uptake Rates**
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Critique:** While unique, this question is conceptually very similar to Question 1. Both involve the relationship $Flux = k_{cat} \times [Enzyme]$ and require unit conversions (hours to seconds, mmol to $\mu mol$), but one asks for $k_{adj}$ and the other for $[Enzyme]$. A slightly different problem type might enhance the overall uniqueness of the set.
    *   **Guideline 11 (Solution Formatting):** **Critique:** Fails. No LaTeX formatting is used for numbers, variables, or units.

---

**Concise, Actionable Feedback for Improvement:**

1.  **Crucial: Implement LaTeX Formatting (All Questions):** This is the most significant and consistent failing. All numerical values, variables, and units must be enclosed in `$` for inline math or `$$...$$` for block math.
    *   *Example for Q1:* Change "The literature $k_{cat}$ value for the *E. coli* alanine transaminase is $50 \, s^{-1}$." to "The literature $k_{cat}$ value for the *E. coli* alanine transaminase is `$50 \, s^{-1}$`." Change "measured flux... $0.8 \, mmol \, gDW^{-1} \, hr^{-1}$" to "measured flux... `$0.8 \, \text{mmol} \, \text{gDW}^{-1} \, \text{hr}^{-1}$`." Change "enzyme concentration is $2 \, \mu mol \, gDW^{-1}$" to "enzyme concentration is `$2 \, \mu\text{mol} \, \text{gDW}^{-1}$`." Change "Calculate the adjusted turnover number ($k_{adj}$, in $s^{-1}$)" to "Calculate the adjusted turnover number (`$k_{adj}$`, in `$s^{-1}$`)"

2.  **Remove Redundancy (Question 1):** Eliminate the sentence "The literature $k_{cat}$ value for the *E. coli* alanine transaminase is $50 \, s^{-1}$." as it is irrelevant to the calculation required.

3.  **Consider Varying Problem Types (Minor, Questions 1 & 5):** While distinct, the core calculation ($Flux = k_{cat} \times [Enzyme]$) is very similar for Questions 1 and 5. To maximize uniqueness across the set, consider if one could be replaced with a different kind of calculation (e.g., involving equilibrium constants, rate laws for non-saturating conditions, or metabolic yield calculations if appropriate for chemistry). This is a minor suggestion, as the current questions are still good.

4.  **Refine "Flux Limiting" Clarity (Question 4):** To ensure broader accessibility for students less familiar with the nuances of FBA, you could explicitly state the proportionality implied by the "flux limiting" condition, e.g., "Given these conditions, the flux through the reaction is directly proportional to the enzyme's turnover number." This makes the single-step calculation more transparent for a general chemistry assessment.

Given that citrate synthase is flux-limiting in both simulations, meaning the flux through the reaction is directly proportional to the enzyme's turnover number, recalculate the flux through the citrate synthase reaction (in `$\text{mmol} \, \text{gDW}^{-1} \, \text{hr}^{-1}$`) in the FBA model using the adjusted turnover number, assuming enzyme concentrations are unchanged.</question>

<question> Integrating Enzyme Constraints with Substrate Uptake Rates:

Consider a simplified metabolic model with a single substrate uptake reaction and one metabolic pathway. The maximum substrate uptake rate is experimentally determined to be `$10 \, \text{mmol} \, \text{gDW}^{-1} \, \text{hr}^{-1}$`. The metabolic pathway contains one enzymatic reaction, catalyzed by enzyme X, with a turnover number of `$k_{cat} = 80 \, s^{-1}$`.

**4. Adjusted Turnover Parameter Impact on Flux Distribution:**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model Chemistry Scenario):** Excellent. Models a realistic scenario in *Bacillus subtilis*.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Numerical/IUPAC Answer):** Excellent. Expects a numerical value with specified units.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Needs Improvement.** The sentence "meaning the flux through the reaction is directly proportional to the enzyme's turnover number" explicitly states the core relationship needed for the calculation. This turns what could be a conceptual challenge (understanding "flux-limiting" in this context) into a single direct multiplication (5.0 * 0.75). It bypasses the need for multi-step reasoning or deeper conceptual understanding.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid Redundancy):** **Needs Improvement.** The explicit definition of "flux-limiting" is redundant as it directly provides the solution method/hint, rather than requiring the student to infer it.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Needs Improvement.** Because of the explicit hint, the calculation becomes extremely simple, reducing the problem's uniqueness and complexity.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Excellent.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** Good, but the definition makes it less challenging.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Avoid Colloquial/Ambiguous):** Excellent.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units Consistent, IUPAC):** Excellent.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Single Part Answer):** Excellent.
    *   **Guideline 11 (LaTeX Formatting):** Excellent.

    *   **Remove the clarifying definition of "flux-limiting"**: Change "Given that citrate synthase is flux-limiting in both simulations, meaning the flux through the reaction is directly proportional to the enzyme's turnover number," to simply: "Given that citrate synthase is flux-limiting in both simulations,".
    *   This forces the student to recall or infer the definition of "flux-limiting" in an enzyme-constrained context, thereby enhancing the multi-step reasoning and complexity.

    *   **Guideline 2 (Numerical/IUPAC Answer):** Excellent. Expects a numerical value with specified units.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Excellent. Requires equating uptake rate to reaction flux, rearranging the flux equation, and performing necessary unit conversions (mmol to $\mu$mol, hours to seconds).
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid Redundancy):** Good. "Assume that all the substrate taken up is processed through the enzyme X reaction" clarifies the system. The phrase "Ensure that all units are converted to match correctly" is a slight hint about the unit conversion challenge but doesn't make the question redundant. It's a mild scaffold.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Good. It's a fundamental concept applied to a practical modeling scenario (minimum enzyme to sustain a rate).
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Excellent.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** Excellent.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Avoid Colloquial/Ambiguous):** Excellent.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units Consistent, IUPAC):** Excellent. This question is a strong test of unit conversion skills.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Single Part Answer):** Excellent.
    *   **Guideline 11 (LaTeX Formatting):** Excellent.

*   **Actionable Feedback:** No specific changes needed for this question. It meets all guidelines exceptionally well.

Consider a simplified metabolic model with a single substrate uptake reaction and one metabolic pathway. The maximum substrate uptake rate is experimentally determined to be `$10 \, \text{mmol} \, \text{gDW}^{-1} \, \text{hr}^{-1}$`. The metabolic pathway contains one enzymatic reaction, catalyzed by enzyme X, with a turnover number of `$k_{cat} = 80 \, s^{-1}$`. Assume that all the substrate taken up is processed through the enzyme X reaction. Determine the minimum enzyme concentration of X (in `$\mu\text{mol} \, \text{gDW}^{-1}$`) required to sustain the maximum substrate uptake rate. Ensure that all units are converted to match correctly.</question>
