Consider a polaritonic system where the vacuum Rabi splitting of an azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction mode is measured as $\hbar \Omega = 120\,\mathrm{meV}$. Assuming the cavity mode frequency matches the vibrational frequency of the alkyne stretch at $2100\,\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, calculate the effective coupling constant $g$ (in $\mathrm{eV}$) between the cavity photon and molecular vibration, given the relation $\hbar \Omega = 2g$.  
Use $1\,\mathrm{cm^{-1}} = 1.2398 \times 10^{-4}\,\mathrm{eV}$.

<question>  
The Quantum Electrodynamics Coupled Cluster (QED-CC) method predicts that embedding a charged azide molecule inside a single-mode optical cavity shifts its ionization potential by $0.15\,\mathrm{eV}$.

<question>  
A polaritonic state formed by strong coupling of an alkyne vibrational mode ($\nu = 2100\,\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$) with a cavity photon exhibits an energy splitting described by the Jaynes-Cummings model as  
$$E_{\pm} = \hbar \omega_c \pm g \sqrt{N}$$

=== Turn 0: Critic feedback ===
Certainly! Here’s a concise, actionable critique of the supplied questions, evaluating them against the provided guidelines (numbered as in your list):

---

### Q1

**Strengths:**  
- Clearly models a physical chemistry scenario involving polaritonic systems.
- All constants and units needed are provided.
- Requires multi-step calculation: converting units and solving for $g$.
- Only one solution (numerical $g$ value).
- Rigorous and concise.

**Improvements:**  
- The phrase “of an azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction mode” can be streamlined to e.g. “of the vibrational mode participating in the azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction” for clarity (Guideline 7).
- Remove “consider” at the start: just directly state the setup.
- “Given the relation $\hbar\Omega = 2g$” is good, but could state “Given that the vacuum Rabi splitting $\hbar\Omega = 2g$” for precision.
- Could specify that the answer must be given with appropriate significant digits.

### Q2

**Strengths:**
- Models a QED-CC computational scenario.
- Single computation of percent change and qualitative outcome.
- All information supplied, units clear.

**Improvements:**
- Second sentence (“...and discuss whether the shift corresponds to stabilization or destabilization of the cationic state.”) introduces a qualitative “discuss” component, violating Guideline 10 and 6.  
  *Recommendation: Only require the calculation (e.g. “State whether the cation is stabilized or destabilized in one word, based on the shift’s sign”).*
- Could explicitly require the answer to be rounded to a specified number of significant digits.

### Q3

**Strengths:**
- Unique, relevant to polaritonics.
- Calculation clearly requires multi-step reasoning.

**Improvements:**
- Starts with an unnecessary description (“A polaritonic state formed...”), could simply say: “Given an energy splitting of... find $g$...”
- “Use $\hbar = 1$” is nonphysical in this context and may need clarification. Given all numbers are in $\mathrm{meV}$, it might be cleaner to let $\hbar$ appear explicitly or clarify units throughout.  
  *Recommendation: Either keep all constants explicit or move entirely to natural units with all quantities matching (Guideline 9).*

### Q4

**Strengths:**
- Direct calculation with proper context.
- Well-posed and requires familiarity with Arrhenius equation.

**Improvements:**
- Missing units for the rate constant in the answer (could specify “Compute the fold increase in rate constant, rounded to two significant digits.”)
- The phrase “assuming Arrhenius behavior and no pre-exponential factor change” is fine but slightly verbose; could just say “Assume the pre-exponential factor is unchanged.”
- Units could be specified more clearly in the answer line.

### Q5

**Strengths:**
- Clear scenario, mathematical.
- Requires multi-step unit conversion and calculation.

**Improvements:**
- “Percentage change in vibrational frequency” (explicit: relative to which value?)—could say “…calculate the percent change in the vibrational frequency due to the shift in ZPE.”
- Could specify that answer should include a sign (increase or decrease).

### Q6

**Strengths:**
- Good scenario, asks for a calculation and a qualitative conclusion.

**Improvements:**
- “Discuss how this modification would qualitatively affect…” violates Guideline 10 (single solution).  
  *Recommendation: Instead, require the student to state either “increases” or “decreases” the IR intensity, based on the calculation—no open-ended discussion.*

### Q7

**Strengths:**
- Pertinent, clear chemical scenario.
- Multi-step: convert eV to kJ/mol, subtraction, percent.

**Improvements:**
- Could specify: “Give the new activation energy in $\mathrm{kJ\,mol^{-1}}$, correct to one decimal place, and the percent change to two significant digits.”
- Wording can be more direct: “The polariton correction alters the transition state energy by $0.12\,\mathrm{eV}$, lowering it relative to reactants...”

### Q8

**Strengths:**
- Well-defined, specific physical chemistry constant calculation.

**Improvements:**
- Ensure all units are consistent (check if $V$’s units are immediately compatible).
- “Mode volume is $10^{-15}\,\mathrm{cm^3}$” could specify that it should be converted to $\mathrm{m^3}$ for consistency.
- State required number of significant digits for the answer.

### Q9

**Strengths:**
- Scalable, asks for physical reasoning with a calculation.

**Improvements:**
- Two distinct answers requested: new splitting energy and new dipole moment.  
  *Recommendation: Only ask for one – e.g., “Calculate the new transition dipole moment,” since it’s the only nontrivial answer; the splitting increase is trivial.*
- Could specify that the answer should be rounded appropriately.

### Q10

**Strengths:**
- Appropriate physical scenario, clear conversion and calculation.

**Improvements:**
- No issues! Direct, meets all guidelines.

---

## General Recommendations

1. **Single-solution focus:** Several questions mix quantitative and qualitative (“discuss”) aspects. Each question must require only one numerical or formula-based answer or one IUPAC name. Remove any “discuss” or “describe” components (Guideline 10).
2. **Conciseness:** Reduce introductory/“Consider”/“Suppose” phrasing. Direct instructions are preferable (Guideline 7).
3. **Units:** Always specify units in the answer prompt; explicitly require answers to stated significant digits or decimal places (Guideline 9).
4. **No multipart:** Do not combine calculations and qualitative questions (Guideline 10).
5. **Non-redundancy and uniqueness:** All questions pass on originality (Guideline 5).
6. **Nomenclature:** If asking for compound names (none do here), remind to use IUPAC names (Guideline 9).
7. **Equation and LaTeX formatting:** All questions use proper LaTeX; just ensure inline math for variables, block math for displayed equations.

---

### Example of improved question (for Q2):
> The QED-CC method predicts that embedding a charged azide molecule in a single-mode optical cavity increases its ionization potential from $8.20\,\mathrm{eV}$ to $8.35\,\mathrm{eV}$. Calculate the percent increase in ionization energy, to two significant digits.

---

**Summary:**  
Your questions are technically rigorous and original, but most can be sharpened by eliminating qualitative/“discuss” aspects, minimizing verbose introductions, explicitly stating answer formatting, and ensuring only one answer is required. This brings each question in line with your guidelines, especially points 6, 7, 9 and 10.

=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Certainly! Here’s a concise critique for each question against your 11-point guidelines + general observations and actionable suggestions.

---

### **General Strengths**
- All questions model advanced, realistic quantum chemistry scenarios (criterion 1, 5).
- Expected answers are clear, specific numerical values with units (2, 6, 9).
- Multi-step reasoning is enforced, routinely requiring unit conversion and interpretation (3).
- Question phrasing is mostly rigorous and concise, with proper use of LaTeX and Markdown for equations and variables (7, 8, 11).
- Most questions are original, not standard textbook fare (5).
- Most questions present single questions, not multipart (10).

---

### **Specific Feedback & Suggestions**

---

#### **Question 1**

> A polaritonic system exhibits a vacuum Rabi splitting... $g$ (in eV), given that $\hbar \Omega = 2g$...

**Evaluation:**  
- **Strengths:** Scenario is clear (polaritonic splitting), expects multi-step calculation, units provided, answer format is unambiguous.
- **Issue:** Minor: You specify "measured as $\hbar \Omega =$..." and then "Assuming the cavity mode frequency matches..."—only one is needed for this calculation, since frequency is not used for $g$.
- **Action:** Streamline to remove any data not essential to the computation for $g$.

---

#### **Question 2**

> The QED-CC method predicts...percent increase in ionization energy, rounded to two significant digits. State whether the ionization potential is increased or decreased by indicating "increased" or "decreased" based on the numerical result.

**Evaluation:**  
- **Strengths:** Context is clear, single-step calculation with interpretation.
- **Issue:** This is a two-part answer: numerical percent plus a qualitative label ("increased" or "decreased").
- **Action:** Revise so the answer requires only the numerical percent; or, phrase so the answer is *only* the label, not both. Example: "Does the ionization potential increase or decrease? Provide the percent change rounded to two significant digits." or "Calculate the percent change (rounded...) and state if it is positive or negative, using a + or – sign."

---

#### **Question 3**

> Given an energy splitting... Jaynes-Cummings model... Calculate the single-molecule coupling constant $g$ (in meV). Use $\hbar = 1$...

**Evaluation:**  
- **Strengths:** Advanced model, multi-step calculation, asks for a *single* numerical value.
- **Issue:** The phrase "Use $\hbar = 1$" is ambiguous: Is $\hbar$ set to dimensionless 1 (atomic units), or does this affect the energy units remaining in meV? Cross-check that the unit manipulation is clear for your student population.
- **Action:** Clarify: "Assume all energies are expressed in meV units and set $\hbar=1$ in these units" or explicitly state what units $g$ should have after setting $\hbar=1$.

---

#### **Question 4**

> QED-CC theory predicts activation barrier...calculate the fold increase in the reaction rate constant...

**Evaluation:**  
- **Strengths:** Realistic scenario, clear calculation steps, answer is a single value.
- **Issue:** None significant. Context, answer format, and phrasing are all clear.
- **Action:** (Optional) Remove "at $298\,\mathrm{K}$" unless anticipating a temperature change.

---

#### **Question 5**

> ...zero-point energy (ZPE) of the azide stretching vibration shifts by $0.05\,\mathrm{eV}$ per molecule...calculate the percent change in vibrational frequency $\nu$...

**Evaluation:**  
- **Strengths:** Realistic, original, single-step calculation.
- **Issue:** Potential ambiguity: ZPE is not directly the vibrational quantum, but half the quantum ($E = \frac{1}{2} h\nu$), so it's good that further clarification is not needed for students at this level.
- **Action:** None; question is rigorous.

---

#### **Question 6**

> ...dipole moment derivative increases by 15%...calculate the new dipole moment derivative...and state whether the infrared absorption intensity will "increase" or "decrease"...

**Evaluation:**  
- **Strengths:** Multi-step reasoning required, advanced context.
- **Issue:** Two-part answer required: numerical value and qualitative trend ("increase"/"decrease").
- **Action:** Require only one answer: for instance, "Calculate the new dipole moment derivative in $\mathrm{D/\mathring{A}}$." Or, "Determine if the IR intensity increases or decreases" (then ask for just the sign). Alternatively, specify "Give your answer as (1) value, (2) trend" for clarity.

---

#### **Question 7**

> ...polaritonic azide-alkyne cycloaddition...polaritonic correction raises the transition state potential energy by $0.12\,\mathrm{eV}$...calculate the new activation energy in $\mathrm{kJ \cdot mol^{-1}}$ and the percent increase...

**Evaluation:**  
- **Strengths:** Advanced, precise, multi-step computation.
- **Issue:** Two separate answers: a value (new energy), and a percent.
- **Action:** Ask for just the new activation energy *or* just the percent change; not both.

---

#### **Question 8**

> ...vacuum electric field amplitude...calculate $E_{\mathrm{vac}}$ in V/m...

**Evaluation:**  
- **Strengths:** Advanced, multi-step, single final value required.
- **Issue:** None recognized.
- **Action:** None; well-phrased single-answer calculation.

---

#### **Question 9**

> ...the transition dipole moment increases, enhancing the Rabi splitting by 20%. If the original splitting energy is $100\,\mathrm{meV}$...calculate the new transition dipole moment (in Debye)...

**Evaluation:**  
- **Strengths:** Clear dependence between variables, calculation is non-trivial, only a single number to report.
- **Issue:** None significant.
- **Action:** None.

---

#### **Question 10**

> ...ground state energy decreases by $4.5\,\mathrm{kJ \cdot mol^{-1}}$. Calculate the corresponding energy change per molecule in electronvolts (eV)...

**Evaluation:**  
- **Strengths:** Gameful context, advanced, computation is clear.
- **Issue:** None recognized.
- **Action:** None.

---

### **Summary of Actionable Changes**

**For all questions:**
- Ensure *only one* answer per question (criterion 10). If a qualitative trend is involved, require only the sign or trend, not both value and trend; or only a value.
- Avoid minor redundancies in background info that do not bear on the calculation (criterion 4).
- Clarify any unit conventions where non-SI settings are used, e.g., when "set $\hbar=1$" or "energies in meV".

**For multi-part answers (Questions 2, 6, 7):**
- Redraft to require only one succinct answer, OR clarify expectation as a (1)...(2)... list.

**Formatting and Phrasing:**
- All questions use LaTeX appropriately; maintain this rigor.
- All chemical nomenclature uses IUPAC where needed; maintain consistency.

---

**Model revision for multi-part question (example):**

> Calculate the percent increase in ionization energy, rounded to two significant digits. *(If positive, state "increase"; if negative, state "decrease.")*

Alternatively:
> Calculate the percent increase in ionization energy, rounded to two significant digits. **Only provide the percent value.**

---

**Bottom Line:**  
Your questions are exemplary for advanced quantum chemistry/physical chemistry assessment. Minor tweaks to ensure single-answer format and to remove any extraneous scenario details will make them optimal according to your guidelines.

- **No major changes needed.**

---

**Q5: ZPE shift and percent change in $\nu$**  
- **Strengths:** Deep comprehension, connects energy shift to frequency.  
- **Improvement:** Just specify that the "percent change" refers to $(\nu_{\text{new}} - \nu_{\text{orig}})/\nu_{\text{orig}} \times 100\%$.  
- **Revision:** Add: "Percent change means $(\nu_{\text{new}} - \nu_{\text{orig}})/\nu_{\text{orig}} \times 100\%$."

---

**Q9: Dipole and Rabi splitting scaling**  
- **Strengths:** Multi-step scaling logic, nontrivial link between physics and chemistry.

## Additional General Suggestions

- **Single Numerical Value:** All questions enforce this well.
- **Equation Formatting:** All use valid LaTeX syntax with Markdown-style delimiters.
- **Conciseness & Rigor:** Well observed, but always double-check for minimal yet sufficient phrasing.
- **Avoiding Redundancy and Colloquialisms:** Minimal redundant info, technical language suitable for advanced chemistry.
- **Originality:** Questions are original and scenario-specific.
- **Units & IUPAC:** Check units are included both in data and expected answers (good), and chemical constraints are unique.
