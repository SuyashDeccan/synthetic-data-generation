- **Units & Numerics:** Questions require explicit, numerically quantified solutions with proper units.
- **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Each question involves multi-stage calculation or data interpretation.
- **Scientific Rigor/Conciseness:** Wording is mostly concise and scientific.
- **Uniqueness:** All are well differentiated from textbook archetypes.
- **No Extraneous Information:** No major irrelevant info is included.

---

#### **Guideline-Specific Improvements**

**1. Single-answer Expectation:**
- **Strength:** Each question expects a single, clearly defined numerical or compound answer.
- **Action:** Maintain this; all are currently single-solution.

**2. Consistency and Clarity in Units and Nomenclature:**
- **Observation:** Units are mostly clear and used properly.
- **Suggestions:**  
  - For energies per mole, emphasize units as $\,\text{kJ/mol}$ (or $\,\text{meV}$, as appropriate).
  - Always clarify if per "mole of cation," "mole of film," or "per bond".

**3. Avoiding Redundancy:**
- **Observation:** No major redundancy.
- **Action:** Continue current practice.

**4. Avoid Multiple Parts:**
- **Observation:** Some questions ask for both calculation and qualitative judgment (e.g., is the process spontaneous).
- **Suggestion:**  
  - **Example (Q6):** "Calculate the Gibbs free energy change (in kJ·mol⁻¹) per hydrogen bond and determine whether the bond formation is spontaneous under these conditions."
    - **Action:** Split into two questions if you want both numerical and conceptual; or, better, only require the calculation as per guidelines.

**5. Solution Formatting:**
- **Observation:** Equation formatting is described properly in the prompt, but in practice, avoid issues such as:
   - Ambiguous variable references (e.g., "perovskite layer"—be explicit, is it "per mole" of whole material, or a component?).
   - Use $...$ for inline math, $$...$$ for block math, as requested.
   - No use of unformatted math blocks.
- **Action:** Carefully check that all equations/numbers are in $...$ or $$...$$.

**6. Colloquial/Ambiguous Terminology:**
- **Observation:** Mostly rigorous. 
- **Action:** Tighten where needed, e.g.:
    - Replace "results in" with "produces" or "leads to," if causality is not truly established.
    - Be precise about "effective number," "interaction energy" (per bond? per cation?), etc.

**7. Consentient Language for Chemistry Nomenclature:**
- **Observation:** All chemical names are IUPAC or standard.
- **Action:** Keep using precise IUPAC names for every compound.

**8. No Textbook Repetition:**
- **Success:** None are standard textbook problems.

**9. Ensure Questions are Unique and Original:**
- **Success:** All current questions are fresh and research-inspired.

---

### **Specific Feedback, Question-by-Question**

#### **Q1**
- **Strengths:** Complex scenario, requires calculation per mole.
- **Action:** Explicitly define whether the "total stabilization energy in one mole" refers to "one mole of perovskite (as a compound/formula unit)" or "one mole of cations" (since not always 1:1). 
- **Equation:** Use $...$ for all math.

#### **Q2**
- **Strengths:** Linear correlation, data reasoning required.
- **Action:** "Calculate the expected exciton binding energy (in meV) when the tilt angle is 9°." Unambiguous.
- **Note:** Good as is.

#### **Q3**
- **Strengths:** Combines concentration, volume, and energy per cation.
- **Action:** Specify "total interaction energy in the film," clarify per cation or per mole if possible.

#### **Q4**
- **Strengths:** Requires multi-part calculation, clear energy penalties.
- **Action:** Wording is clear. Just ensure all terms (distortion, hydrogen bond) are precisely defined.

#### **Q5**
- **Strengths:** Requires use of Arrhenius equation for rates.
- **Action:** All values are defined. The term "$k_{\text{aromatic}}$" is precise. No change needed.

#### **Q6**
- **Strengths:** Thermodynamic calculation leading to qualitative answer.
- **Issue:** As per guideline 10, don't ask for more than one answer.
- **Action:** Either:
  - Only calculate $\Delta G$ (numeric result),
  - Or only ask if the process is spontaneous at 300 K (qualitative).
- **Recommendation:** Drop the second part ("determine whether the bond formation is spontaneous") to adhere strictly to guideline 10.

#### **Q7**
- **Strengths:** Physics-based reasoning, single numeric result.
- **Action:** Standalone numeric answer, clear.

#### **Q8**
- **Strengths:** Use of Coulomb's Law, careful with units.
- **Action:** Make sure all constants are in SI and convert answer to $\,\text{kJ/mol}$.

#### **Q9**
- **Strengths:** Charge mobility/dielectric relationship.
- **Action:** No issues. The proportionality direction is clear.

#### **Q10**
- **Strengths:** Advanced quantum chemistry reasoning, explicit variable definitions.
- **Action:** Explicitly state that $|V|$ is constant for both cases, as you did.

### **Global Recommendations**

1. **Check All Units:** For context, ensure every question clearly specifies units for the expected answer and all data. Any ambiguity in "per bond," "per cation," "per mole" should be immediately clarified.
2. **Split Multi-Part Questions:** Never combine a numerical and a qualitative response. Stick to one answer per question.
3. **Consistent Equation Formatting:** Always use $...$ for inline and $$...$$ for block equations, never leave unformatted math.
4. **Explicit Variable Definition:** If mentioning "perovskite layer," "film," "octahedron," etc., always specify the basis for per-mole or per-unit calculations.
5. **Avoid Implied Reasoning:** Always define whether calculations use per formula unit, per mole of cations, etc. Avoid phrasing that may leave this ambiguous.
6. **Consistent and Correct Terminology:** Maintain clear, advanced, and consistent use of chemical and physical terms; avoid casual English.
7. **No Composite Questions:** Remove any requirement for both calculation and qualitative determination in a single item.

### **Sample Revision**

For example, **Q6** could be revised to:

> A perovskite solar cell incorporating aromatic cations exhibits a hydrogen bond formation enthalpy of $-35\,\text{kJ} \cdot \text{mol}^{-1}$ per bond and entropy change of $-85\,\text{J} \cdot \text{mol}^{-1} \cdot \text{K}^{-1}$ per bond at $300\,\text{K}$. Calculate the Gibbs free energy change (in $\,\text{kJ} \cdot \text{mol}^{-1}$) per hydrogen bond at $300\,\text{K}$.

### General Feedback (All Questions):

1. **Units Consistency:** Always ensure units are consistent and conversions (e.g., $\text{cm}^3$ to $\text{L}$) are clearly specified if needed.
2. **Ambiguity:** Avoid phrases such as "on average," unless the distribution does not impact the one-solution nature. Be explicit about what to round to.
3. **One Solution:** Ensure no multiple valid answers—each question should have exactly one outcome.
4. **Redundancy:** Exclude any distractor details or context that has no bearing on the answer.
5. **Clarity and Conciseness:** Phrasing should be direct, using only standard IUPAC or SI units and not mixing units without explicit definition.
6. **Formatting:** All equations, variables, and numbers must be rendered using Markdown-compatible LaTeX.

### Individual Questions:

---

- **Action:** Standardize phrasing on averages and outcomes.

---

#### **Q5**

- **Strengths:** Direct, uses classic kinetic model, matches guidelines very well.
- **Suggestions:**
  - None significant, minor phrasing tweak: "Calculate the rate constant $k_{\text{aromatic}}$ (in $\text{s}^{-1}$) at $298\,\text{K}$."
- **Action:** Keep as is or reword to state clearly "at $T = 298\,\text{K}$".

---

- **Suggestions:**
  - Rephrase as "Calculate the ratio $\mu_{\text{aromatic}} / \mu_{\text{aliphatic}}$" only.
  - Remove phrase "assuming all other factors equal."
- **Action:** Sharpen the wording, focus only on calculation.

---

#### **Q10**

- **Strengths:** Advanced, requires ratio, matches guidelines.
- **Suggestions:**
  - Explicitly state to round the answer to a certain number of significant figures.
  - Clarify that $|V|$ is constant and $\Delta G^0 = 0$; perhaps include "Assume all other parameters are constant."

| Phrasing         | Occasional wordiness or implied multi-part answers   | Use direct, command-style wording           |


---

**Final Tips:**
- For each question, *require* a numerical answer rounded to a specified decimal place, and always in SI units (or units explicitly dictated in the question).
- Remove any "on average" or "effective" wording unless it is critical to the calculation and only one answer is possible.
- Remove unnecessary chemical context unless it is directly changing the calculation or is essential for understanding.
- Do not mix units in calculations; always prompt for conversions if necessary, or provide all data in one system.

**In summary:** Your questions mostly satisfy the criteria but can be tightened by removing ambiguity ("average", "effective"), being even more explicit with units and intentions, and eliminating any details that do not alter or impact the single correct answer.

=== Turn 2: Critic feedback ===
Here is a concise critique based on your specified guidelines:

---

1. **Model a Chemistry Scenario**

   - **Strengths:** All questions clearly model realistic or advanced solid-state/perovskite chemistry scenarios, which are non-standard and often unique.
   - **Improvement:** The scenarios are well-chosen and do not need adjustment.

2. **Expect Answers as Numerical Values/IUPAC Compounds**

   - **Strengths:** All questions ask explicitly for a single numerical value (e.g., energy, rate constant, ratio) and specify units.
   - **Improvement:** None needed.

3. **Force Multi-Step Reasoning**

   - **Strengths:** Each question requires multi-step calculations or reasoning (unit conversions, use of equations, proportional reasoning, etc.).
   - **Improvement:** None; they already go beyond superficial calculations.

4. **Avoid Redundancy/Extraneous Information**

   - **Strengths:** Most questions are focused and avoid irrelevant details.
   - **Feedback:** Question 1 provides a number density when only "per mole" cation calculations are requested—potentially extraneous unless the density is meant to clarify normalization.
      - **Suggestion:** Remove number density if not required or clarify its necessity.

5. **Be Unique, Not Standard Textbook Problems**

   - **Strengths:** All questions are original and context-specific, not repetitive textbook queries.
   - **Improvement:** None needed.

6. **Single Solution Per Question**

   - **Strengths:** Each question demands a single, unambiguous answer.
   - **Improvement:** No multiple-part queries detected.

7. **Rigorous, Concise Phrasing**

   - **Strengths:** Wording is clear, precise, and technical.
   - **Improvement:** None needed.

8. **Avoid Colloquial/Ambiguous Terminology**

   - **Strengths:** No colloquialisms or ambiguous terms found.
   - **Improvement:** None needed.

9. **Units Consistent/Chemical Names IUPAC**

   - **Strengths:** Units are consistent throughout; nomenclature is correct (e.g., methylammonium, aromatic ammonium cations).
   - **Improvement:** None.

10. **Avoid Multi-Part Questions**

    - **Strengths:** All questions request a single value/result.
    - **Improvement:** No splitting required.

11. **Solution Formatting – LaTeX Markdown**

    - **Strengths:** Equations are properly formatted using $...$ and $$...$$.
    - **Improvement:** None needed.

## Individual Feedback & Suggestions

### Question 1
- **Issue:** The number density is given, but the question only requires energy per mole of cation, so this is unnecessary.
- **Action:** Omit number density unless you want students to use it to normalize per cm$^3$.

### Question 2
- **Strengths:** Clear, expects a straightforward linear interpolation.
- **Action:** None.

### Question 3
- **Strengths:** Detailed and clear, multi-step.
- **Suggestion:** For maximum clarity, state if "total energy" means sum for all cations, not per mole.

### Question 4
- **Strengths:** Unambiguous, multi-step.
- **Action:** None.

### Question 5
- **Strengths:** Rigorous, advanced, well-posed.
- **Action:** None.

### Question 6
- **Strengths:** Classic thermodynamics, clearly stated.
- **Action:** None.

### Question 7
- **Strengths:** Quantitative, focuses on mathematical relationship.
- **Action:** None.

### Question 8
- **Strengths:** Well-defined, unambiguous use of Coulomb’s law.
- **Action:** None.

### Question 9
- **Strengths:** Clear, expects proportional reasoning.
- **Action:** Specify if the answer should be greater or less than one for clarity.

### Question 10
- **Strengths:** Excellent use of Marcus theory, multi-step, requires careful math.
- **Action:** None.

## Summary of Improvements

- **Omit extraneous data** (e.g., number density in Q1 unless needed for the computation).
- **Specify exactly what the numerical value refers to** (total for film, per mole, per cation, etc.).
- **Maintain this standard for clarity and rigor**; overall, the questions are exemplary for advanced chemistry assessment.
