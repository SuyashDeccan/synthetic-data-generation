<question>  
CsMnF$_4$ undergoes a pressure-induced magnetic transition from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic ordering at a critical pressure $P_c$. Given that the exchange interaction energy $J$ depends on pressure as  
$$J(P) = J_0 \exp(-\alpha P),$$  
where $J_0 = 12.0\, \mathrm{meV}$ (ferromagnetic, positive sign) at ambient pressure and $\alpha = 0.15\, \mathrm{GPa}^{-1}$. The magnetic transition occurs when $J(P_c) = 0$. Determine the critical pressure $P_c$ in gigapascals (GPa) at which the magnetic ordering switches from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic.</question>  

<question>  
In CsMnF$_4$, the Jahn–Teller distortion causes an elongation of MnF$_6$ octahedra resulting in a tetragonal crystal field splitting $\Delta$ of 0.35 eV. If the pressure applied reduces the octahedral volume by 8%, leading to a linear increase of crystal field splitting $\Delta$ by 15%, determine the new $\Delta$ (in electronvolts) under pressure. Use the linear approximation and report your answer with three significant figures.</question>  

<question>  
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict a unit cell volume of $V_{\mathrm{theo}} = 160.0\, \mathrm{\AA}^3$ for CsMnF$_4$ at ambient pressure, while X-ray diffraction experiments measure $V_{\mathrm{exp}} = 154.8\, \mathrm{\AA}^3$. Calculate the percentage discrepancy between theoretical and experimental volumes. Then, assuming the bulk modulus $B = 50.0\, \mathrm{GPa}$, estimate the pressure (in GPa) at which the theoretical volume would compress to match the experimental measurement, using the linear compressibility approximation $\Delta V / V_0 = -P/B$.</question>  

<question>  
The shift from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic phases in CsMnF$_4$ correlates with a change in Mn$^{3+}$ ion spin alignment lowering the total magnetization per unit cell by 0.85 $\mu_B$. Given the magnetic moment per Mn$^{3+}$ ion in the ferromagnetic phase is 4.5 $\mu_B$, calculate the effective magnetic moment per Mn$^{3+}$ ion in the antiferromagnetic phase, considering there are two Mn ions per unit cell. Express your answer in $\mu_B$ to two decimal places.</question>  

<question>  
Under high pressure, CsMnF$_4$ undergoes a first-order structural phase transition from a tetragonal ($P4/mmm$) to an orthorhombic ($Pnma$) phase with a measured lattice parameter change ratio along the $a$-axis of $\Delta a/a = -0.023$.

$$E_{JT} = \frac{1}{2}k Q^2,$$  
where $k = 40.0\, \mathrm{eV \cdot \AA^{-2}}$. If the experimentally observed distortion amplitude $Q = 0.15\, \mathrm{\AA}$ decreases by 20% under pressure, calculate the change in Jahn–Teller stabilization energy $\Delta E_{JT}$ (in eV) due to pressure.</question>  

<question>  
The exchange interaction constant $J$ for CsMnF$_4$ is theoretically calculated to be $10.5\, \mathrm{meV}$ at 0 GPa, while neutron scattering experiments under 2 GPa pressure yield $J_{\mathrm{exp}} = 7.8\, \mathrm{meV}$.

Here’s a critique of your questions against each guideline, with strengths and actionable improvements:

---

### 1. Magnetic Transition Pressure (Question 1)
**Feedback:**
- **Strengths:** Good use of scenario, units, and requires multi-step reasoning.
- **Issues:** There is a *logical error*: $J(P) = J_0 \exp(-\alpha P)$ never reaches zero for real $P$; the exponential never vanishes, so $J(P_c) = 0$ cannot be satisfied.
- **Action:** Rephrase such that the sign of $J$ flips (e.g., $J(P) = J_0 - \alpha P$) and $P_c = J_0/\alpha$. Or, phrase it as finding when $J$ drops below a specific threshold that defines the FM–AFM transition.

---

### 2. Jahn–Teller Distortion & Crystal Field Splitting (Question 2)
**Feedback:**
- **Strengths:** Appropriate scenario, clear expectation of numeric value, units given, multi-step calculation.
- **Issues:** Calculation steps are minimal but acceptable. The 8% volume reduction is extraneous since only the 15% increase in $\Delta$ is needed.
- **Action:** Remove the unnecessary volume reduction info unless it is to be used in a further calculation.

---

### 3. DFT and Volume Compression (Question 3)
**Feedback:**
- **Strengths:** Real-world model, multi-step, units, concise phrasing, asks for one numeric value.
- **Issues:** Asks for two answers (“percentage discrepancy” and “estimate the pressure…”).
- **Action:** Split into two questions or just focus on the pressure estimate for uniqueness and single-answer compliance.

---

### 4. Effective Magnetic Moment Calculation (Question 4)
**Feedback:**
- **Strengths:** Scenario is good, multi-step, requires unit cell logic.
- **Issues:** Some ambiguity—does the reduction of magnetization per cell come from reorientation or reduced local moment? It’s solvable, but wording could be clearer.
- **Action:** Phrase “total magnetization per unit cell decreases by…” more precisely. Make it explicit whether the reduction per cell is solely due to spin alignment.

---

### 5. Lattice Parameter Change (Question 5)
**Feedback:**
- **Strengths:** Good scenario, asks for single numeric answer, all information relevant.
- **Issues:** None.
- **Action:** Consider dropping “Show the calculation” unless the expectation is for the respondent (not needed for the question stem).

---

### 6. Jahn–Teller Stabilization Energy Change (Question 6)
**Feedback:**
- **Strengths:** All requirements met: scenario, multi-step, one solution, units, IUPAC-labeled.
- **Issues:** None.
- **Action:** You might specify if you expect “final energy” or “change in energy,” but question is clear as stated.

---

### 7. Pressure Dependence of Exchange Constant (Question 7)
**Feedback:**
- **Strengths:** Unique situation, requires quantitative reasoning with theoretical/experimental comparison.
- **Issues:** Steps required are a bit underdetermined; “systematically overestimates by 25%” could be clearer: Should answer just multiply the experiment by 1.25? Is “linear dependence” meant to be shown explicitly?
- **Action:** Clarify the intended step sequence, e.g., “What value would theory predict at 2 GPa, given that theory always gives 1.25 times the experimental value at any pressure?”

---

### 8. $e_g$ Splitting and Photon Wavelength (Question 8)
**Feedback:**
- **Strengths:** Classic but not overly common, uses scenario, units, requires calculation.
- **Issues:** Could be more context-specific; “$e_g$ splitting” is standard but not so novel.
- **Action:** Consider making the scenario more original, or refer to specific spectral bands.

---

### 9. Work Done During Phase Transition (Question 9)
**Feedback:**
- **Strengths:** Good context, numerical answer, suitable units, requires steps.
- **Issues:** The "and comment if..." phrase creates a qualitative secondary task.
- **Action:** Remove or rephrase “and comment…” to keep it strictly single-answer. For example: "Calculate the work done (in kJ/mol) during the volume change. Is this amount greater or less than the measured $\Delta H$?"

---

## General Recommendations

1. **Strict “Single Solution” Compliance:** Ensure each question requests exactly one answer—numerical or one chemical compound/formula.
2. **Remove Extra Information/Tasks:** Don’t include extra details that don’t affect the computation or request more than one calculation/comment per problem.
3. **Logical Consistency:** Make sure each mathematical model in the scenario can actually be used to obtain a solution as posed (see Q1).
4. **Originality:** Most questions are sufficiently original, but consider also referencing less-common properties or more advanced calculations if aiming for uniqueness.
5. **Equation Formatting:** Good use of Markdown and LaTeX; keep the formatting consistent and correct.

## Example Edits

- Q1 (Edit):  
  *Original problematic model*: $J(P) = J_0 \exp(-\alpha P)$ can never be zero.  
  *Improved model*: $$J(P) = J_0 - \alpha P$$  
  *Question*: "Determine the critical pressure $P_c$ at which $J(P_c) = 0$."

- Q3 (Edit):  
  Ask only for the pressure at which $V_{\mathrm{theo}}$ matches $V_{\mathrm{exp}}$, not also the percentage discrepancy unless you intend to split the question.

**Question 8: Wavelength from energy gap**
- Good physics/chemistry crossover.
- **Improvement:** All elements of question are needed. Could specify how many significant figures (e.g., "to three significant figures").

---

**Question 9: Enthalpy and mechanical work**
- Well-done scenario, both chemical and physical reasoning.
- **Improvement:** Specify which units should be used for results ("in kJ/mol").
- Explicitly state which volume change to use ($V_1 \to V_2$) if relevant.  
- Confirm that answer expects mechanical work $W = P(V_1 - V_2) \cdot N_A$, as the answer requires careful attention to units.

## General Feedback

**What you consistently do well:**
- Questions are original and grounded in realistic (but not textbook-standard) chemistry contexts.
- Every question is direct and requires single, well-defined calculations.
- Mathematical formatting is rigorous and clear.

**What to fix or clarify:**
1. **Units and significant figures:** Always specify the expected number of significant figures/decimal places for the answer.
2. **Ambiguity elimination:** Any parameter or formula variable (e.g., is $V_0$ initial volume?) should be defined explicitly.
3. **Single-solution safeguard:** In questions where a logic choice could lead to multiple interpretations (e.g., direction of change, use of the formula, etc.), clarify which logic path is correct.
4. **Redundant adverbs/adjectives:** Phrases like "linearly by 15%" (Question 2) could be simplified for clarity, unless the rate of change is meant to be explicitly with respect to another variable.
5. **Consistency:** Align the style for requesting significant figures, units, and result formatting across questions.

**Summary:**  
Your assessment is advanced, original, and nearly flawless with a few tweaks for clarity and solution precision (sig figs, explicit variable definition). These changes will ensure each question has only a single possible answer and that no ambiguity remains for students.

<question>  
CsMnF$_4$ undergoes a pressure-induced magnetic transition from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic ordering at a critical pressure. The exchange interaction energy $J$ depends on pressure as  
$$J(P) = J_0 - \alpha P,$$  
where $J_0 = 12.0\, \mathrm{meV}$ and $\alpha = 1.5\, \mathrm{meV/GPa}$. Calculate the critical pressure $P_c$ (in GPa) at which $J$ changes sign. Express your answer with two significant figures.

In CsMnF$_4$, the Jahn–Teller distortion causes an initial tetragonal crystal field splitting $\Delta = 0.35\, \mathrm{eV}$. If $\Delta$ increases by 15%, calculate the final value of $\Delta$ (in eV). Express your answer with three significant figures.

<question>  
Density functional theory (DFT) predicts a unit cell volume $V_{\mathrm{theo}} = 160.0\, \mathrm{\AA}^3$ for CsMnF$_4$ at ambient pressure, while experiments measure $V_{\mathrm{exp}} = 154.8\, \mathrm{\AA}^3$. Assuming a bulk modulus $B = 50.0\, \mathrm{GPa}$ and using the linear compressibility approximation  
$$\frac{\Delta V}{V_0} = -\frac{P}{B},$$  
where $V_0 = V_{\mathrm{theo}}$, estimate the pressure $P$ (in GPa) required for $V_{\mathrm{theo}}$ to compress to $V_{\mathrm{exp}}$. Express your answer with two significant figures. Assume linear compressibility holds over this pressure range.

The transition from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic phases in CsMnF$_4$ reduces the total magnetization per unit cell by $0.85\, \mu_B$ due to perfect antiparallel spin alignment. Given that the magnetic moment per Mn$^{3+}$ ion in the ferromagnetic phase is $4.5\, \mu_B$ and there are two Mn ions per unit cell, calculate the effective magnetic moment per Mn$^{3+}$ ion in the antiferromagnetic phase. Express your answer in $\mu_B$ with two decimal places.

<question>  
During a first-order structural phase transition in CsMnF$_4$, the $a$-axis lattice parameter changes by  
$$\frac{\Delta a}{a} = -0.023.$$  
If the ambient pressure lattice parameter is $a_0 = 4.20\, \mathrm{\AA}$, calculate the lattice parameter $a$ (in \AA) after the transition. Express your answer with three significant figures.

The Jahn–Teller stabilization energy in CsMnF$_4$ is  
$$E_{JT} = \frac{1}{2} k Q^2,$$  
where $k = 40.0\, \mathrm{eV \cdot \AA^{-2}}$ and the distortion amplitude $Q = 0.15\, \mathrm{\AA}$. If pressure reduces $Q$ by 20%, calculate the change in Jahn–Teller energy,  
$$\Delta E_{JT} = E_{JT,\ \mathrm{final}} - E_{JT,\ \mathrm{initial}},$$

<question>  
The exchange interaction constant $J$ for CsMnF$_4$ is theoretically calculated as $10.5\, \mathrm{meV}$ at 0 GPa, while neutron scattering experiments measure $J_{\mathrm{exp}} = 7.8\, \mathrm{meV}$ at 2 GPa. Assuming the theoretical values of $J$ are consistently 25% higher than experimental values at every pressure and that $J$ depends linearly on pressure, calculate the theoretical $J$ value at 2 GPa (in meV). Express your answer with two significant figures.

In CsMnF$_4$, Jahn–Teller distortion splits degenerate $e_g$ orbitals by an energy gap $\Delta E = 0.40\, \mathrm{eV}$.

At the pressure-driven phase transition in CsMnF$_4$, the unit cell volume decreases from $V_1 = 162.4\, \mathrm{\AA}^3$ to $V_2 = 157.6\, \mathrm{\AA}^3$. The experimentally measured enthalpy difference between phases at the transition pressure $P = 0.8\, \mathrm{GPa}$ is $\Delta H = 2.5\, \mathrm{kJ \cdot mol^{-1}}$. Calculate the mechanical work (in kJ/mol) done on the sample during the volume change, using  
$$W = P \times \Delta V \times N_A,$$  
where $\Delta V = V_1 - V_2$ in m$^3$/unit cell, and $N_A$ is Avogadro's number ($6.022 \times 10^{23}\, \mathrm{mol^{-1}}$). Note: $1\, \mathrm{\AA}^3 = 10^{-30}\, \mathrm{m}^3$. Express your answer with two significant figures.
