Here are five novel master's level chemistry questions based on your specifications:

1.  <question>Crystallite size effect on Néel temperature.

    A series of $Fe_2O_3$ nanoparticles are synthesized via thermal decomposition, yielding crystallite sizes of $8$ nm and $16$ nm. The bulk Néel temperature ($T_N$) of $Fe_2O_3$ is $950$ K. Assume that the reduction in $T_N$ scales inversely with the crystallite diameter, and that a crystallite size of $4$ nm would result in a Néel temperature that is $80\%$ of the bulk value. Estimate the Néel temperature (in K) of the $16$ nm nanoparticles, assuming the relationship:
    $$T_N(D) = T_N^{bulk} - A/D$$
    where $D$ is the crystallite diameter and $A$ is a constant determined by the $4$ nm data point.</question>

2.  <question>Photocatalytic efficiency and band gap correlation.

    A semiconductor material is synthesized for photocatalytic water splitting. Its band gap energy ($E_g$) is determined to be $2.1$ eV. The efficiency of hydrogen production is found to be $\eta_1$. Through doping, the band gap is reduced to $1.9$ eV, and the hydrogen production efficiency becomes $\eta_2$. Assume that the photocatalytic efficiency is directly proportional to the number of photons absorbed and that photon absorption is directly proportional to $(h\nu - E_g)$ where $h\nu$ is the energy of the incident light. If the incident light has a wavelength of $500$ nm, calculate the ratio $\eta_2 / \eta_1$, assuming the incident light intensity remains constant.</question>

    $LaMnO_3$ exhibits antiferromagnetic (AFM) behavior. When doped with $20\%$ strontium ($Sr^{2+}$), it becomes ferromagnetic due to the introduction of $Mn^{4+}$ ions, with the formula $La_{0.8}Sr_{0.2}MnO_3$. Assume the magnetic moments of $Mn^{3+}$ and $Mn^{4+}$ are $4 \mu_B$ and $3 \mu_B$ respectively. The saturation magnetization is $M_s = n\mu_B$ where n is the number of Bohr magnetons per formula unit and $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton. Considering the $La_{0.8}Sr_{0.2}MnO_3$ formula, calculate the expected saturation magnetization in Bohr magnetons ($\mu_B$) per formula unit.</question>

### **General Feedback on All Questions**

A significant and pervasive issue across all questions is the inconsistent application of LaTeX formatting (Guideline 11). Numbers, variables, chemical formulas, units, and even simple mathematical operators like ratios are frequently not enclosed in math mode (`$`). This makes the questions difficult to read and inconsistent with professional scientific formatting.

### **Question 1: Crystallite size effect on Néel temperature.**

<question>Crystallite size effect on Néel temperature.

A series of $Fe_2O_3$ nanoparticles are synthesized via thermal decomposition, yielding crystallite sizes of $8$ nm and $16$ nm. The bulk Néel temperature ($T_N$) of $Fe_2O_3$ is $950$ K. Assume that the reduction in $T_N$ scales inversely with the crystallite diameter, and that a crystallite size of $4$ nm would result in a Néel temperature that is $80\%$ of the bulk value. Estimate the Néel temperature (in K) of the $16$ nm nanoparticles, assuming the relationship:
$$T_N(D) = T_N^{bulk} - A/D$$
where $D$ is the crystallite diameter and $A$ is a constant determined by the $4$ nm data point.</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Chemistry Scenario):** Met. Plausible scenario in materials science.
*   **Guideline 2 (Numerical/IUPAC Answer):** Met. Asks for a numerical value in K.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Met. Requires calculating the constant $A$ first, then applying it to find the unknown Néel temperature.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid Redundancy):** **Needs improvement.** The information about the `$8$ nm` crystallite size is extraneous and not used in the calculation. This violates the guideline.
*   **Guideline 5 (Unique/Complex):** Met. This is a specific application of size-dependent properties, suitable for a master's level.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Met. Provides one unique numerical answer.

*   **Guideline 9 (Consistent Units/IUPAC):** Met. Units and chemical formula are consistent.
*   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Met.
*   **Guideline 11 (LaTeX Formatting):** **Needs significant improvement.** Numerous instances where numbers (`$8$ nm`, `$16$ nm`, `$4$ nm`, `$80\%$`, `$950$ K`), chemical formulas (`$Fe_2O_3$`), and variables/terms (`$T_N$`, `$D$`, `$A$`) are not enclosed in math mode (`$`) when used inline outside of the main equation block.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1.  Remove the redundant information about the `$8$ nm` crystallite size.
2.  Change "Estimate" to "Calculate" for precision.
3.  Thoroughly review and apply LaTeX math mode (`$`) for all numbers, units, chemical formulas, and variables used inline throughout the question.

### **Question 2: Photocatalytic efficiency and band gap correlation.**

<question>Photocatalytic efficiency and band gap correlation.

A semiconductor material is synthesized for photocatalytic water splitting. Its band gap energy ($E_g$) is determined to be $2.1$ eV. The efficiency of hydrogen production is found to be $\eta_1$. Through doping, the band gap is reduced to $1.9$ eV, and the hydrogen production efficiency becomes $\eta_2$. Assume that the photocatalytic efficiency is directly proportional to the number of photons absorbed and that photon absorption is directly proportional to $(h\nu - E_g)$ where $h\nu$ is the energy of the incident light. If the incident light has a wavelength of $500$ nm, calculate the ratio $\eta_2 / \eta_1$, assuming the incident light intensity remains constant.</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Chemistry Scenario):** Met. Relevant to materials chemistry and energy applications.
*   **Guideline 2 (Numerical/IUPAC Answer):** Met. Asks for a numerical ratio.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Met. Requires calculating photon energy, then efficiency for both band gaps, and finally the ratio. Requires unit conversions.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid Redundancy):** Met. All information is necessary.
*   **Guideline 5 (Unique/Complex):** Met. Applies principles of semiconductor physics to a chemical process. The assumed relationship is a simplification but serves the purpose of the problem.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Met. Provides one unique numerical answer.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** **Needs improvement.** The statement "photon absorption is directly proportional to $(h\nu - E_g)$" is a significant simplification for a master's level. While the question asks students to *assume* this, it's physically imprecise. Crucially, this proportionality implies negative values if $h\nu < E_g$, which is physically impossible. The statement should explicitly include the condition that this proportionality only holds for $h\nu \ge E_g$, and the efficiency is zero otherwise. (In this specific problem, $h\nu$ for $500$ nm is greater than both band gaps, so it does not lead to an invalid calculation, but the assumption is poorly phrased).
*   **Guideline 8 (Avoid Colloquial/Ambiguous):** **Needs improvement.** The ambiguity regarding the lower bound of the proportionality (as noted in Guideline 7) makes the underlying physical model incomplete.
*   **Guideline 9 (Consistent Units/IUPAC):** Met. Units (`eV`, `nm`) are consistent.
*   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Met.
*   **Guideline 11 (LaTeX Formatting):** **Needs significant improvement.** Numerous instances where numbers (`$2.1$ eV`, `$1.9$ eV`, `$500$ nm`), variables (`$E_g$`, `$\eta_1$`, `$\eta_2$`, `$h\nu$`), and ratios (`$\eta_2 / \eta_1$`) are not enclosed in math mode (`$`) when used inline.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1.  Clarify the proportionality for absorption: "Assume that the photocatalytic efficiency is directly proportional to the number of photons absorbed, and that photon absorption is directly proportional to $(h\nu - E_g)$ for $h\nu \ge E_g$ (and zero otherwise), where $h\nu$ is the energy of the incident light."
2.  Thoroughly review and apply LaTeX math mode (`$`) for all numbers, units, chemical formulas, and variables used inline throughout the question.

### **Question 3: BFDH model and crystal morphology.**

<question>BFDH model and crystal morphology.

A crystal of barium sulfate ($BaSO_4$) grows from an aqueous solution. The following face attachment energies are calculated using the BFDH model: $E_{att}(001) = 1.2 \times 10^{-19}$ J, $E_{att}(010) = 1.8 \times 10^{-19}$ J, and $E_{att}(100) = 2.4 \times 10^{-19}$ J. Predict the ratio of the lengths of the crystal along the [100], [010], and [001] directions, respectively. Report the calculated ratio as x:y:z where x, y and z are integers with no common factors.</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Chemistry Scenario):** Met. Highly relevant to crystallography and crystal growth.
*   **Guideline 2 (Numerical/IUPAC Answer):** Met. Asks for an integer ratio.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Met. Requires understanding the relationship between attachment energy and crystal dimensions (length is inversely proportional to growth rate, which is proportional to attachment energy), then calculating and simplifying the ratio.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid Redundancy):** Met. All information is necessary.
*   **Guideline 5 (Unique/Complex):** Met. This is a good application of BFDH principles at a master's level.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Met. Provides one unique integer ratio.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** Met. The phrasing is clear.
*   **Guideline 8 (Avoid Colloquial/Ambiguous):** Met. The relationship between face attachment energy and overall crystal morphology (specifically "lengths of the crystal") is a standard interpretation within the BFDH framework (lower attachment energy leads to slower growth, making the face more prominent, and thus the crystal dimension along its normal *smaller* for a given growth time). Or, if interpreted as actual physical length, the dimension is proportional to $1/E_{att}$. This is the standard assumption.
*   **Guideline 9 (Consistent Units/IUPAC):** Met. Units (`J`) and notation (`$BaSO_4$`, crystallographic directions) are consistent.
*   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Met.
*   **Guideline 11 (LaTeX Formatting):** **Needs significant improvement.** Instances where chemical formulas (`$BaSO_4$`), units (`$J$`), and crystallographic directions (`$[100]$`, `$[010]$`, `$[001]$`) are not enclosed in math mode (`$`) when used inline. The ratio format `x:y:z` should also be `x:y:z`.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1.  Thoroughly review and apply LaTeX math mode (`$`) for all numbers, units, chemical formulas, and variables/notation (including crystallographic directions and the output format `$x:y:z$`) used inline throughout the question.

$LaMnO_3$ exhibits antiferromagnetic (AFM) behavior. When doped with $20\%$ strontium ($Sr^{2+}$), it becomes ferromagnetic due to the introduction of $Mn^{4+}$ ions, with the formula $La_{0.8}Sr_{0.2}MnO_3$. Assume the magnetic moments of $Mn^{3+}$ and $Mn^{4+}$ are $4 \mu_B$ and $3 \mu_B$ respectively. The saturation magnetization is $M_s = n\mu_B$ where n is the number of Bohr magnetons per formula unit and $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton. Considering the $La_{0.8}Sr_{0.2}MnO_3$ formula, calculate the expected saturation magnetization in Bohr magnetons ($\mu_B$) per formula unit.</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 2 (Numerical/IUPAC Answer):** Met. Asks for a numerical value in Bohr magnetons.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Met. Requires determining the proportions of $Mn^{3+}$ and $Mn^{4+}$ from the stoichiometry, then calculating the total magnetic moment based on these proportions and given individual moments.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid Redundancy):** Met. All information is necessary for the calculation and context.
*   **Guideline 5 (Unique/Complex):** Met. This is a very good master's level question, requiring application of charge neutrality and spin-only moments.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Met. Provides one unique numerical answer.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** Met. Clear and to the point.
*   **Guideline 8 (Avoid Colloquial/Ambiguous):** Met.

*   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Met.
*   **Guideline 11 (LaTeX Formatting):** **Needs significant improvement.** Numerous instances where chemical formulas (`$LaMnO_3$`, `$La_{0.8}Sr_{0.2}MnO_3$`), ions (`$Sr^{2+}$`, `$Mn^{4+}$`, `$Mn^{3+}$`), variables (`$M_s$`, `$n$`, `$\mu_B$`), and numerical values with units (`$4 \mu_B$`, `$3 \mu_B$`) are not consistently enclosed in math mode (`$`) when used inline.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1.  Thoroughly review and apply LaTeX math mode (`$`) for all numbers, units, chemical formulas, ions, and variables used inline throughout the question.

### **Question 5: Thermal decomposition pathway prediction.**

<question>Thermal decomposition pathway prediction.

A metal-organic framework (MOF) of composition $[Zn_2(bdc)_2(dabco)]$ (where bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate and dabco = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) is subjected to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Assume that dabco decomposes first, followed by bdc, and finally $Zn_2O_2$ remains. Molar masses: $Zn = 65.38 \ g/mol$, $C = 12.01 \ g/mol$, $H = 1.01 \ g/mol$, $O = 16.00 \ g/mol$, $N = 14.01 \ g/mol$. Predict the mass percentage of zinc oxide ($ZnO$) remaining after complete decomposition of the organic ligands. Report the answer as a percentage to two decimal places.</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Chemistry Scenario):** Met. Realistic scenario in MOF synthesis and characterization.
*   **Guideline 2 (Numerical/IUPAC Answer):** Met. Asks for a numerical percentage.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Met. Requires determining the full molecular formula of the MOF from its components, calculating molar masses of the MOF and the residue, and then calculating the mass percentage.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid Redundancy):** **Needs improvement.** The information "Assume that dabco decomposes first, followed by bdc" is extraneous. The *sequence* of decomposition is irrelevant for calculating the *final* mass percentage of the residue. Also, the title "Thermal decomposition pathway prediction" is misleading as no pathway prediction is required.
*   **Guideline 5 (Unique/Complex):** Met. This is a good, complex problem involving MOF stoichiometry, suitable for a master's level.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Met. Provides one unique numerical answer.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** Mostly met.
*   **Guideline 8 (Avoid Colloquial/Ambiguous):** **Needs minor improvement.** The residue `$Zn_2O_2$` is unusual notation; it's typically just `$2 ZnO$` (two formula units of zinc oxide) that would remain. While mathematically the same mass, `$Zn_2O_2$` implies a specific dimer or structure that might not be the actual final bulk product. "Finally zinc oxide ($ZnO$) remains, corresponding to the initial zinc content" would be clearer.
*   **Guideline 9 (Consistent Units/IUPAC):** Met. Units (`$g/mol$`, `%`) and chemical nomenclature (bdc, dabco defined) are consistent.
*   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Met.
*   **Guideline 11 (LaTeX Formatting):** **Needs significant improvement.** Numerous instances where chemical formulas (`$Zn_2(bdc)_2(dabco)$`, `$Zn_2O_2$`, `$ZnO$`), molar masses (`$65.38 \ g/mol$`, `$12.01 \ g/mol$` etc.), and units (`$g/mol$`) are not consistently enclosed in math mode (`$`) when used inline. The MOF formula should also be consistent (`$Zn_2(bdc)_2(dabco)$`).

**Actionable Feedback:**

1.  Remove the irrelevant information about the sequence of decomposition. Rephrase the title to reflect the actual question (e.g., "Residue mass prediction from MOF decomposition").
2.  Clarify the residue formula: "finally $2 \ ZnO$ (zinc oxide) remains" or "finally zinc oxide ($ZnO$) remains, corresponding to the initial zinc content."
3.  Thoroughly review and apply LaTeX math mode (`$`) for all numbers, units, chemical formulas, and variables used inline throughout the question. The MOF formula should be `$Zn_2(bdc)_2(dabco)$` (excluding the outer square brackets from the math mode unless they are strictly part of the formula name in a specific context).

<question>Crystallite size effect on Néel temperature.

A series of $Fe_2O_3$ nanoparticles are synthesized via thermal decomposition, yielding a crystallite size of $16$ nm. The bulk Néel temperature ($T_N$) of $Fe_2O_3$ is $950$ K. Assume that the reduction in $T_N$ scales inversely with the crystallite diameter, and that a crystallite size of $4$ nm would result in a Néel temperature that is $80\%$ of the bulk value. Calculate the Néel temperature (in K) of the $16$ nm nanoparticles, assuming the relationship:
$$T_N(D) = T_N^{bulk} - A/D$$
where $D$ is the crystallite diameter and $A$ is a constant determined by the $4$ nm data point.</question>

<question>Photocatalytic efficiency and band gap correlation.

A semiconductor material is synthesized for photocatalytic water splitting. Its band gap energy ($E_g$) is determined to be $2.1$ eV. The efficiency of hydrogen production is found to be $\eta_1$. Through doping, the band gap is reduced to $1.9$ eV, and the hydrogen production efficiency becomes $\eta_2$. Assume that the photocatalytic efficiency is directly proportional to the number of photons absorbed, and that photon absorption is directly proportional to $(h\nu - E_g)$ for $h\nu \ge E_g$ (and zero otherwise), where $h\nu$ is the energy of the incident light. If the incident light has a wavelength of $500$ nm, calculate the ratio $\eta_2 / \eta_1$, assuming the incident light intensity remains constant.</question>

<question>BFDH model and crystal morphology.

A crystal of barium sulfate ($BaSO_4$) grows from an aqueous solution. The following face attachment energies are calculated using the BFDH model: $E_{att}(001) = 1.2 \times 10^{-19}$ J, $E_{att}(010) = 1.8 \times 10^{-19}$ J, and $E_{att}(100) = 2.4 \times 10^{-19}$ J. Predict the ratio of the lengths of the crystal along the $[100]$, $[010]$, and $[001]$ directions, respectively. Report the calculated ratio as $x:y:z$ where $x$, $y$ and $z$ are integers with no common factors.</question>

<question>Impact of doping on magnetic properties of $LaMnO_3$.

$LaMnO_3$ exhibits antiferromagnetic (AFM) behavior. When doped with $20\%$ strontium ($Sr^{2+}$), it becomes ferromagnetic due to the introduction of $Mn^{4+}$ ions, with the formula $La_{0.8}Sr_{0.2}MnO_3$. Assume the magnetic moments of $Mn^{3+}$ and $Mn^{4+}$ are $4 \mu_B$ and $3 \mu_B$ respectively. The saturation magnetization is $M_s = n\mu_B$ where $n$ is the number of Bohr magnetons per formula unit and $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton. Considering the $La_{0.8}Sr_{0.2}MnO_3$ formula, calculate the expected saturation magnetization in Bohr magnetons ($\mu_B$) per formula unit.</question>

<question>Residue mass prediction from MOF decomposition.

A metal-organic framework (MOF) of composition $Zn_2(bdc)_2(dabco)$ (where bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate and dabco = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) is subjected to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Molar masses: $Zn = 65.38 \ g/mol$, $C = 12.01 \ g/mol$, $H = 1.01 \ g/mol$, $O = 16.00 \ g/mol$, $N = 14.01 \ g/mol$. Predict the mass percentage of zinc oxide ($ZnO$) remaining after complete decomposition of the organic ligands. Report the answer as a percentage to two decimal places.</question>

=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of each question against your guidelines, with concise, actionable feedback:

---

**Question 1: Crystallite size effect on Néel temperature.**

*   **Critique:** This is a very strong question. It successfully models a chemistry scenario (nanomaterials), requires multi-step reasoning (calculate $A$, then use it), and provides a clear, single numerical solution. The phrasing is rigorous, and units/nomenclature are consistent. It is unique in its specific application of a size-dependent scaling law to a magnetic property.
*   **Adherence to Guidelines:** Excellent (11/11).
*   **Actionable Feedback for Improvement:** No significant improvements needed. The prompt "Assume that the reduction in $T_N$ scales inversely with the crystallite diameter" is slightly redundant as the formula explicitly states this, but it adds clarity rather than confusion.

---

**Question 2: Photocatalytic efficiency and band gap correlation.**

*   **Critique:** Another excellent question. It models a relevant chemical process (photocatalysis), demands multi-step calculations (photon energy, then two absorption values, then ratio), and aims for a single numerical answer. The assumptions for efficiency and absorption are clearly stated, making the problem solvable.
*   **Adherence to Guidelines:** Excellent (11/11).
*   **Actionable Feedback for Improvement:** For maximum clarity and self-containment, consider explicitly providing fundamental constants like Planck's constant ($h$), the speed of light ($c$), and the conversion factor between eV and J. While often assumed knowledge, providing them eliminates potential lookup issues or variations in significant figures.

---

**Question 3: BFDH model and crystal morphology.**

*   **Critique:** This is a strong, specialized question that effectively tests knowledge of crystal growth models. It establishes a clear scenario and requires a specific interpretation of the BFDH model's relationship to crystal dimensions (inverse proportionality of length to attachment energy), leading to a unique numerical ratio.
*   **Adherence to Guidelines:** Excellent (11/11).
*   **Actionable Feedback for Improvement:** The phrasing "Predict the ratio of the lengths of the crystal along the $[100]$, $[010]$, and $[001]$ directions" could be slightly more explicit about what "length" refers to in the context of growth rates and crystal morphology (e.g., "Predict the ratio of the extents of the crystal along the..."). However, given the explicit mention of the BFDH model, students familiar with the model should be able to deduce the correct interpretation (that slower-growing faces are more prominent and contribute proportionally more to the crystal's dimensions along that direction, or inversely proportional to attachment energy). As written, it's already a good test of specific understanding.

---

**Question 4: Impact of doping on magnetic properties of $LaMnO_3$.**

*   **Critique:** This is an outstanding question. It models a real-world materials chemistry problem (doping perovskites), requires complex multi-step reasoning (charge balance, oxidation state determination, calculation of average magnetic moment), and yields a single numerical value. It's highly original and specific, avoiding generic textbook examples.
*   **Adherence to Guidelines:** Excellent (11/11).
*   **Actionable Feedback for Improvement:** No improvements needed. The contextual information about AFM to FM transition is relevant background and does not introduce redundancy.

---

**Question 5: Residue mass prediction from MOF decomposition.**

*   **Critique:** This is an excellent question that tests stoichiometry and understanding of MOF thermal decomposition. It requires multiple steps including deducing ligand formulas (if not explicitly known), calculating molar masses, and applying mass conservation. It's a highly relevant and modern chemistry scenario.
*   **Adherence to Guidelines:** Excellent (11/11).
*   **Actionable Feedback for Improvement:** To minimize ambiguity regarding the exact chemical formulas of the organic ligands, consider explicitly providing the full molecular formulas ($C_8H_4O_4$ for bdc and $C_6H_{12}N_2$ for dabco) alongside their common names/abbreviations. This ensures the assessment focuses purely on the stoichiometry and decomposition calculations, rather than on recall of complex organic ligand structures. However, for an advanced chemistry assessment, knowing common ligand formulas might be an intended learning outcome.

A series of $Fe_2O_3$ nanoparticles are synthesized via thermal decomposition, yielding a crystallite size of $16$ nm. The bulk Néel temperature ($T_N$) of $Fe_2O_3$ is $950$ K.  Assume that a crystallite size of $4$ nm would result in a Néel temperature that is $80\%$ of the bulk value. Calculate the Néel temperature (in K) of the $16$ nm nanoparticles, assuming the relationship:

<question>Photocatalytic efficiency and band gap correlation.

A semiconductor material is synthesized for photocatalytic water splitting. Its band gap energy ($E_g$) is determined to be $2.1$ eV. The efficiency of hydrogen production is found to be $\eta_1$. Through doping, the band gap is reduced to $1.9$ eV, and the hydrogen production efficiency becomes $\eta_2$. Assume that the photocatalytic efficiency is directly proportional to the number of photons absorbed, and that photon absorption is directly proportional to $(h\nu - E_g)$ for $h\nu \ge E_g$ (and zero otherwise), where $h\nu$ is the energy of the incident light. If the incident light has a wavelength of $500$ nm, calculate the ratio $\eta_2 / \eta_1$, assuming the incident light intensity remains constant. Use the following constants: Planck's constant $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \ Js$, Speed of light $c = 3 \times 10^8 \ m/s$, $1 \ eV = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \ J$.</question>

Predict the ratio of the extents of the crystal along the $[100]$, $[010]$, and $[001]$ directions, respectively, assuming crystal extent is inversely proportional to attachment energy.

    *   **4. Avoid Redundancy:** Minor redundancy. The statements "$LaMnO_3$ exhibits antiferromagnetic (AFM) behavior" and "it becomes ferromagnetic" are background information on the magnetic transition upon doping. While chemically interesting, they don't directly contribute to the *calculation* of saturation magnetization based on the given magnetic moments.
    *   **5. Be Unique:** This problem effectively combines charge balance with magnetic moment calculation, making it a good, non-standard problem.
    *   **6. Single solution:** Yes, a single numerical answer.

*   **Actionable Feedback for Question 4:**
    *   To strictly adhere to "Avoid Redundancy" (Guideline 4), consider rephrasing or removing sentences that provide background information about the magnetic *behavior* change (AFM to ferromagnetic) if they are not explicitly used in the calculation. For example, you could focus purely on the structural and charge compensation aspects: "Doping $LaMnO_3$ with $20\%$ strontium ($Sr^{2+}$) leads to the formula $La_{0.8}Sr_{0.2}MnO_3$ through the introduction of $Mn^{4+}$ ions. Assume the magnetic moments of $Mn^{3+}$ and $Mn^{4+}$ are $4 \mu_B$ and $3 \mu_B$ respectively. The saturation magnetization is $M_s = n\mu_B$ where $n$ is the number of Bohr magnetons per formula unit and $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton. Calculate the expected saturation magnetization in Bohr magnetons ($\mu_B$) per formula unit."

<question>Crystallite size effect on Néel temperature.

A series of $Fe_2O_3$ nanoparticles are synthesized via thermal decomposition, yielding a crystallite size of $16$ nm. The bulk Néel temperature ($T_N$) of $Fe_2O_3$ is $950$ K.  Assume that a crystallite size of $4$ nm would result in a Néel temperature that is $80\%$ of the bulk value.

<question>Photocatalytic efficiency and band gap correlation.

A semiconductor material is synthesized for photocatalytic water splitting. Its band gap energy ($E_g$) is determined to be $2.1$ eV. The efficiency of hydrogen production is found to be $\eta_1$. Through doping, the band gap is reduced to $1.9$ eV, and the hydrogen production efficiency becomes $\eta_2$. Assume that the photocatalytic efficiency is directly proportional to the number of photons absorbed, and that photon absorption is directly proportional to $(h\nu - E_g)$ for $h\nu \ge E_g$ (and zero otherwise), where $h\nu$ is the energy of the incident light. If the incident light has a wavelength of $500$ nm, calculate the ratio $\eta_2 / \eta_1$, assuming the incident light intensity remains constant. Use the following constants: Planck's constant $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \ Js$, Speed of light $c = 3 \times 10^8 \ m/s$, $1 \ eV = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \ J$.</question>
