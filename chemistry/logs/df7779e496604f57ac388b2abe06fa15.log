<question>  
A two-dimensional perovskite exhibits a charge transfer rate constant $k_{\text{CT}}$ governed by non-adiabatic Marcus theory:

$$k_{\text{CT}} = \frac{2\pi}{\hbar} |V|^2 \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi \lambda k_B T}} \exp\left[-\frac{(\Delta G^\circ + \lambda)^2}{4\lambda k_B T}\right],$$

where $|V| = 25\,\text{meV}$ is the electronic coupling, reorganization energy $\lambda = 0.22\,\text{eV}$, driving force $\Delta G^\circ = -0.18\,\text{eV}$, $T=298\,K$, $\hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-16}\,\text{eV}\cdot \text{s}$, and Boltzmann constant $k_B = 8.617\times 10^{-5}\,\text{eV}\cdot K^{-1}$.

- ✔ Multi-step calculation is required; all parameters provided with correct units.
- ✔ Numerical value (with units, $s^{-1}$) required.
- ✔ Only one numerical answer with correct significant figures.
- ✔ No extraneous information.
- ✔ Rigorous, concise phrasing.
- ✔ Units and LaTeX formatting are consistent.
- **Suggestion:** Specify how much rounding should occur in intermediate steps for clarity, e.g., “Keep at least 4 significant digits in intermediate calculations for accuracy.”
- **No action needed.**

---

## Question 2

**Feedback:**
- ✔ Realistic, specific scenario involving perovskite-binding energetics.
- ✔ Requires straightforward, single-step numerical calculation.
- ✔ No ambiguity; one answer with correct units and significant digits.
- ✔ No extraneous information.

- **No further action needed.**

---

## Question 3

**Feedback:**
- ✔ Models a physical chemistry scenario with realistic parameters.
- ✔ Requires multi-step calculation (unit conversion, formula substitution); all constants provided.
- ✔ Only one value to compute, clearly specified units.
- ✔ Proper parameter units and LaTeX formatting.
- **Minor issues:**
  - The variable $\mu$ is described as “ammonium headgroup” dipole moment; clarify (e.g., “point dipole moment of the headgroup”).
  - “Estimate” could be replaced with “Calculate” for stricter scientific phrasing.
- **Action:** Replace “estimate” with “calculate”. Clarify “headgroup dipole” as “point dipole moment”.

---

## Question 4

**Feedback:**
- ✔ Good use of Boltzmann distribution and surface energetics in perovskite chemistry.
- ✔ Single, dimensionless answer requested; all constants provided.
- ✔ Requires multi-step reasoning.
- ✔ No ambiguity in phrasing.
- ✔ Units and LaTeX formatting are consistent.
- **Minor Improvement:** The instruction “surface coverage…assuming adsorption-limited occupancy” may be clarified. For maximal rigor, you might prepend: “Assume equilibrium coverage is proportional to the Boltzmann factor of the binding energy.” Alternatively, add “assuming no lateral interactions.”
- **Action:** Clarify what “adsorption-limited occupancy” entails, e.g., “Assume equilibrium fractional coverage ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor based on binding energy difference.”
- **Consider:** Remove the phrase “conformation of the passivant” in favor of “adsorbed conformer”.

---

## Question 5

**Feedback:**
- ✔ Involves acid-base equilibrium for a passivating cation using real pKa values.
- ✔ Requires multi-step calculation, including the contribution from both protonation states.
- **Potential Ambiguity:** The phrase “fraction of fully protonated cations” is not fully clear for a molecule with two ionizable sites: Should the respondent calculate the fraction where both sites are protonated (i.e., fully protonated form only), or should they include partial protonation as well?
- **Action:** Explicitly specify: “Determine the equilibrium fraction of organic cations having both sites protonated…” or “in the fully protonated (dication) form…”
- **Units:** None needed here, as answer is a pure fraction (decimal).

**Overall Evaluation**  
Your questions are high-quality, challenging, and adhere closely to advanced chemistry assessment design. They have clear real or idealized scenarios, precise requests for numerical answers, force detailed calculations, and use rigorous language. Below are specific critiques and improvement suggestions against each of your listed guidelines.

---

## 1. **Charge Transfer Rate (Non-Adiabatic Marcus Theory)**

**Strengths:**
- Scenario is realistic for materials chemistry.
- Requires multi-step calculation (unit conversions, exponentials).
- Phrasing is concise and technical.
- All necessary constants are provided.

**Improvements:**
- *Units Consistency:* State explicitly that all energy terms must be in eV.
- *Clarity:* It may help to remind students to convert $|V|$ to eV if there is any ambiguity.
- *Redundancy:* Consider omitting "Keep at least four significant digits..." since you specify the required precision in the answer; instead, just require final answer with three significant digits.
- *Formatting:* No major issues; your Markdown/LaTeX formatting appears correct.

**Actionable Revision:**  
- Remove the instruction about significant digits in intermediate steps.
- Make sure to specify energy units (all in eV) at the top of the parameter list.

---

## 2. **Binding Energy vs Alkyl Chain Length**

**Strengths:**
- Scenario is concrete and grounded in surface science.
- Calculation is very clear and direct.
- Units are consistent and numerical answer is specified.

**Improvements:**
- *Step Complexity:* Only single step (substitution in a linear equation). While this is not strictly against your guidelines, it is a less complex calculation compared to your others.
- *Suggestion:* Consider requiring calculation for two values of $n$ (e.g., for $n=8$ and $n=4$ and have them compare), or alternatively have the student solve for $n$ given a target $E_b$ — but only if you can preserve a single answer.
- *Formatting:* Well-presented.

**Actionable Revision:**  
- Consider adding a step (e.g., "If the experimental binding energy for $n=8$ is $-1.24$ eV, does the model over- or underestimate binding?") but only if it **does not introduce a second answer**.

---

## 3. **Electrostatic Interaction Energy Calculation**

**Strengths:**
- Scenario is authentic for materials chemistry.
- Multi-step conversion and calculation required.
- Phrasing is rigorous.
- Units and conversion factors are clearly specified.

**Improvements:**
- *Over-Specification:* Explicitly stating the value of $e$ in the equation may not be necessary since $\mu$ is in Debye and could cause confusion—clarify dimensional analysis.
- *Clarity:* Consider clarifying that $d$ must be converted to meters to avoid inadvertent unit errors.

**Actionable Revision:**  
- Add "Convert all quantities to SI units before calculating" or specify units for $d$ at the point of its introduction.

---

## 4. **Surface Coverage Ratio Calculation (Boltzmann Equilibrium)**

**Strengths:**
- Scenario is clear, specific, and not a textbook clone.
- Requires multi-step reasoning (sum of energies, calculation of exponent, Boltzmann relation).
- Units consistent and answer format unambiguous.

**Improvements:**
- *Ambiguity:* The phrase "their gas-phase energies differ by..." can be misinterpreted as which is higher; instead, specify the energy of each or which is lower/higher.
- *Step Clarity:* Consider defining "total energy" formally in the question (i.e., total = binding + gas phase) to avoid confusion.

**Actionable Revision:**  
- Specify which conformation has the lower gas-phase energy.
- Explicitly state that total energy per conformation is $E_\text{tot} = E_\text{gas-phase} + E_b$.

---

## 5. **Fraction of Dication at pH (Henderson-Hasselbalch)**

**Strengths:**
- Realistic acid-base scenario for surface chemistry.
- Requires stepwise equilibrium constant analysis.
- Clear about final answer format.

**Improvements:**
- *Single Solution:* Good — only one value must be computed.
- *Clarity:* Specify that the two ammonium groups are *chemically distinct* (to avoid confusion if they're equivalent).
- *Redundancy:* None.
- *Nomenclature:* Avoid ambiguity—use "fully protonated (dicationic) form" instead of "dication".

**Actionable Revision:**  
- Briefly state that the two ammonium groups are distinguishable (if intended).
- Add a clarifying parenthetical: "...the fraction of fully protonated (dicationic) cations..."

---

### **General Formatting and Phrasing**

- Your Markdown/LaTeX formatting is excellent and compatible with rendering engines.

Here's a **detailed critique** of each question against your provided guidelines, followed by **general and individual feedback for improvement**.

---

### **General Strengths**
- All questions model plausible physical/chemical scenarios rooted in materials/physical chemistry.
- Units are specified and consistent.
- Numerical answers are requested with precision/units indicated.
- Multi-step quantitative reasoning is needed in each problem.
- Wording is concise and non-colloquial.
- Each problem appears to have one defined numerical solution.

### **General Weaknesses**
- Some questions border on being multi-part because they require calculating several intermediate quantities before a final answer.
- Some background information might be excessive, which could distract from the core problem.
- The use of equations, while necessary, could be formatted more clearly in markdown.
- None of the questions require IUPAC nomenclature (so that part of your objectives is untested, but not necessarily a flaw for this set).
- A few prompts could clarify precisely what is meant by “the answer” (e.g., "the fraction fully protonated" leaves open questions about number format or whether to report as a percentage).
- Some equation references or variable definitions could be more explicit for self-contained clarity.

---

## **Question-by-Question Feedback**

---

### **Question 1 (Marcus Theory $k_{\text{CT}}$ Calculation)**

**Strengths:**
- Realistic scenario based on Marcus theory; not a textbook example.
- All variables defined, units given, and conversion directions (meV to eV) provided.
- Equation provided in full, with notation explained.

**Weaknesses:**
- Requires a lengthy multi-step calculation (could be argued as several mini-steps).
- The exponential term needs careful unit consistency, which could be clarified for test-takers.
- While clear, there’s *slight* redundancy in the parameter listing ($V$ given as both 25 meV and 0.025 eV).
- The phrase "all energy terms are in electronvolts (eV)" is somewhat redundant since all quantities are already in eV.

**Actionable Improvements:**
- State explicitly that all numbers are already in eV to avoid confusion.
- Consider removing the extra conversion of $|V|$ for brevity.
- Ensure the Markdown can render all equations ($$...$$ or $...$ appropriately).

---

### **Question 2 (Binding Energy vs Alkyl Chain Length)**

**Strengths:**
- Direct calculation, chemical scenario (surface binding).
- Variables and constants well defined with units.
- Explicitly requests answers for $n=4$ and $n=8$.

**Weaknesses:**
- *Slightly* multi-part, as it requires two distinct answers (could be argued as two separate items).
- The calculation is almost trivial; it lacks depth or complexity.

**Actionable Improvements:**
- To adhere to single-solution policy, restrict to one $n$ value (“Calculate $E_b$ for $n = 8$”).
- Or, make the question more interpretive by asking at which $n$ the binding energy crosses a specific threshold, requiring algebra and reasoning.

---

### **Question 3 (Electrostatic Interaction Energy of Dipole)**

**Strengths:**
- Realistic scenario; uses real dipole and permittivity data.
- All variables, conjugations, and unit conversion factors clearly supplied.
- Requires careful unit management for a multi-step computation.
- Solution format request is precise.

**Weaknesses:**
- Slight redundancy in restating the need to convert everything to SI: can reduce verbosity.
- Could clarify what sign the energy should carry (though formula is defined with negative explicit).

**Actionable Improvements:**
- Remove redundant “*Note:* Convert all quantities...” (since SI is standard), or just retain as a brief parenthetical.
- Confirm equation renders correctly in markdown (use $$...$$ for block).

---

### **Question 4 (Boltzmann Ratio of Surface Coverage Between Conformers)**

**Strengths:**
- Real-world scenario, not a textbook example.
- Variables all explicitly defined.
- Calculation demands combining relative energies, Boltzmann factor, careful attention to sign conventions.

**Weaknesses:**
- The problem almost requires two steps: compute total energies, then Boltzmann ratio; may border on "two parts".
- The phrasing "Assuming equilibrium fractional surface coverage is proportional to..." could be tightened.

**Actionable Improvements:**
- State in the question: "Compute $R$" (rather than "Calculate the ratio...")
- Consider giving one set of energies and stating the energy difference only, to reduce input steps.

---

### **Question 5 (Equivalent Fraction Protonated Using pKa and Henderson-Hasselbalch)**

**Strengths:**
- Scenario is plausible, not a textbook acid-base example.
- Requires chemical reasoning around multiple pKa events and application of equations.
- Solution expected as a number in defined format.

**Weaknesses:**
- Slight ambiguity in the phrase “fully protonated at both sites”—could define in the molecular context (e.g., "the fraction of cations present as $[\mathrm{R(NH_3)_2}]^{2+}$")
- No need to say “using the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation and appropriate acid-base equilibria”—could just say “determine the fraction...”.
- Calculation is reasonably straightforward; could benefit from more subtlety or context.

**Actionable Improvements:**
- Tighten phrasing: explicitly state “Report as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.”
- Remove direction to 'use Henderson-Hasselbalch;' let that be implied by context.
- (optional) Could further specify that IUPAC names be given for the species involved, but not strictly necessary.

   - Remove multi-unit listing for $|V|$, only state in eV.
   - Remove statement "all energy terms are in eV" if all are given as such.
2. **Binding Energy:**  
   - Only require one $n$ value per question, or ask for a threshold analysis for added depth.
3. **Electrostatics:**  
   - Remove "convert all values" note; simply specify all in SI units.
4. **Boltzmann Ratio:**  
   - Tighten phrasing for proportionality and clarify exactly what's being computed; consider if it is possible to further unify steps.
5. **Acid-Base:**  
   - Define "fully protonated" molecular species explicitly.
   - Tighten instruction on reporting answer.
   - Remove explicit equation usage instruction; context suffices.

**In summary:**  
Your questions are nearly fully in line with advanced assessment best practice, but can be further improved by (i) eliminating minor redundancy, (ii) tightening question wordings, (iii) ensuring strict adherence to "single solution per question," and (iv) simplifying instructions regarding units and calculation steps. Markdown/LaTeX formatting is generally good, but ensure all displays will work in student-facing material. No substantial issues with chemical rigor or ambiguity.

<question>  
A two-dimensional perovskite exhibits a charge transfer rate constant given by non-adiabatic Marcus theory:

\[
k_{\mathrm{CT}} = \frac{2\pi}{\hbar} |V|^2 \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi \lambda k_B T}} \exp\left[-\frac{(\Delta G^\circ + \lambda)^2}{4 \lambda k_B T}\right].
\]

Here, the electronic coupling \(|V| = 0.025\,\text{eV}\), reorganization energy \(\lambda = 0.22\,\text{eV}\), driving force \(\Delta G^\circ = -0.18\,\text{eV}\), temperature \(T = 298\,K\), reduced Planck constant \(\hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-16}\,\text{eV}\cdot \text{s}\), and Boltzmann constant \(k_B = 8.617 \times 10^{-5}\,\text{eV/K}\).

Calculate the charge transfer rate constant \(k_{\mathrm{CT}}\) in \(\mathrm{s}^{-1}\). Express your final answer in scientific notation with three significant figures.

An organic ammonium cation binds to a layered lead iodide perovskite surface with a binding energy \(E_b\) that depends linearly on alkyl chain length \(n\):

\[
E_b = E_0 - \alpha n,
\]

where \(E_0 = -1.12\,\text{eV}\) and \(\alpha = 0.015\,\text{eV per methylene unit}\).

Calculate the binding energy \(E_b\) for an alkyl chain with \(n = 8\). Report your answer in eV to three decimal places.

<question>  
A hybrid perovskite film includes an organic cation whose ammonium headgroup has a dipole moment \(\mu = 3.5\,\mathrm{D}\), located at a distance \(d = 3.2\,\text{\AA}\) from the perovskite surface.

Using the classical electrostatic interaction energy

\[
E_{\mathrm{int}} = -\frac{\mu e}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r d^2},
\]

where the elementary charge \(e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19}\,C\), vacuum permittivity \(\varepsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12}\,C^2/(J \cdot m)\), and relative permittivity \(\varepsilon_r = 6.5\):

- Convert \(\mu\) from Debye to Coulomb·meters (\(1\,\mathrm{D} = 3.336 \times 10^{-30} \,C \cdot m\)),  
- Convert \(d\) from \(\text{\AA}\) to meters (\(1\,\text{\AA} = 1.0 \times 10^{-10} \,m\)),

then calculate \(E_{\mathrm{int}}\) in electronvolts (eV). Express your final answer with three significant figures.

<question>  
A 2D perovskite material adsorbs an organic passivating cation in two conformations: planar-cis and pyramidal-trans. Their gas-phase energies differ by \(\Delta E = 0.085\,\text{eV}\), with the planar-cis conformer lower in energy:

\[
E_{\mathrm{gas, cis}} = E_{\mathrm{gas, trans}} - 0.085\,\text{eV}.
\]

Their adsorption binding energies are

\[
E_{b,\mathrm{cis}} = -1.07\,\text{eV}, \quad E_{b,\mathrm{trans}} = -0.92\,\text{eV}.
\]

The total energy on the surface is \(E_{\mathrm{tot}} = E_{\mathrm{gas}} + E_b\). Assuming equilibrium surface coverage is proportional to the Boltzmann factor \(\exp(-E_{\mathrm{tot}} / k_B T)\), and neglecting lateral interactions, calculate the ratio

\[
R = \frac{\theta_{\mathrm{cis}}}{\theta_{\mathrm{trans}}}
\]

at \(T = 298\,K\) (with \(k_B = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \,\text{eV/K}\)). Express your answer as a dimensionless number rounded to two decimal places.

<question>  
An organic ammonium cation passivating a lead iodide perovskite has two chemically distinct ammonium groups with \( \mathrm{p}K_a \) values of 9.3 and 5.6. At pH 7.0, determine the equilibrium fraction of cations fully protonated at both sites (i.e., the dicationic form) assuming independent acid-base equilibria at each site.

Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.
