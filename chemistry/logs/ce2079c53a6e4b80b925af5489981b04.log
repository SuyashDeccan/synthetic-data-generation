## Per-Question Feedback

**Q1**  
*Strengths*:  
- Unique and contextual scenario.
- Forces multi-step reasoning through thermodynamics/logarithms.
- Units and constants are clear.  
*Possible improvements*:  
- Clarify explicitly that only enthalpy differences matter if entropy is strictly negligible.
- Ensure "$\frac{K_\text{Li}}{K_\text{Na}}$" has only one possible value.
- "Exhibiting" is fine, but "have binding energies" may be more direct.

**Q2**  
*Strengths*:  
- Unique contextual setup.
- Clearly expects a calculated percentage with units specified.
*Possible improvements*:  
- Opening phrase could read, "In the crystal structure of a HIM–sodium complex, ..." for absolute clarity.
- Remove the phrase "as a positive value" since the answer will naturally be positive if question is well-posed.

**Q3**  
*Strengths*:  
- Incorporates idealized geometric and hard sphere models.
- Direct calculation required; units are clear.
*Possible improvements*:  
- Specify what atoms the "Li–O–I angle" is measured between to prevent ambiguity.
- Explicitly state all radii apply to the respective atoms involved in the minimum contact.

**Q4**  
*Strengths*:  
- One calculation, multi-step, well-posed.
*Possible improvements*:  
- Could remove "using the relation"—assume students know the formula (unless introductory level).

**Q5**  
*Strengths*:  
- Crisp, direct crystallographic calculation.
- One unique answer, all variables clear.
*Possible improvements*:  
- Phrase as "round your answer to the nearest integer" rather than "rounded to the nearest integer."

**Q6**  
*Strengths*:  
- Atoms modeled with Lennard-Jones, non-trivial reasoning.
*Possible improvements*:  
- Remove excess wording about the physical origin unless needed; keep it succinct.

**Q7**  
*Strengths*:  
- Correct application of Eyring theory; nontrivial inputs.
*Possible improvements*:  
- Specify expected energy units for the answer up front, not just "to two decimal places."
- Formula is given, which is helpful, but could be omitted for advanced students (depending on level).

**Q8**  
*Strengths*:  
- Concise, clear, one unique answer.
*Possible improvements*:  
- May specify that "for one mole of unit cells" (if ambiguity possible about per unit cell vs. per mole).

**Q9**  
*Strengths*:  
- Good, real-world scenario; one unambiguous outcome.
*Possible improvements*:  
- Specify "percent increase (relative to lithium complex)" for absolute clarity.

**Q10**  
*Strengths*:  
- Integrates multiple thermodynamic concepts.
*Possible improvements*:  
- Clarify that the entropy change refers specifically to the process at the given temperature.
- Specify "give your answer as a signed value" for enthalpy to avoid ambiguity.

---

## **General Recommendations**

1. **Be explicit about direction and definition** of terms (e.g., what is the "Li–O–I angle", what is meant by "minimum Li···I distance").
2. **Ensure units for all input data** are explicit—even if conventional (e.g., "activation entropy in J·mol⁻¹·K⁻¹").
3. **Remove phrases like "as a positive value"** unless there is genuine ambiguity about sign.
4. **Exclude instructions within the problem** where possible; for advanced assessments, trust the student to apply standard conventions, unless the question is for lower-level courses.
5. **If providing equations**, clarify if students are expected to know them or if provision is integral to the test level.
6. **Ensure all calculated values have a single, unique answer**, and no ambiguity about variables/constants.
7. **Avoid "assume" phrasing unless strictly needed**; state what is known and what is to be found, unambiguously.

---

## **Sample Improved Prompt**

*Original*:  
"A hypervalent iodine macrocycle (HIM) forms a supramolecular complex with lithium ion exhibiting a binding energy of –215 kJ·mol⁻¹..."

*Improved*:  
"A hypervalent iodine macrocycle (HIM) forms supramolecular complexes with Li⁺ (binding energy $-215$ kJ·mol⁻¹) and Na⁺ (binding energy $-178$ kJ·mol⁻¹). If the difference in binding energy arises solely from enthalpy and entropy contributions are negligible, calculate the equilibrium constant ratio $$\frac{K_\text{Li}}{K_\text{Na}}$$ at $298$ K, where $K = \exp(-\Delta G^\circ/RT)$. Use $R = 8.314$ J·mol⁻¹·K⁻¹. Express your answer to three significant figures."

**Summary:**  
Your questions are well-crafted, unique, and chemically sophisticated, but could benefit from minor clarifications for direction, units, and ambiguity elimination. Be attentive to sign conventions, over-specification, and ensure precise language for a flawless chemistry assessment.

**Overall Feedback (based on your guidelines):**

### General strengths:
- All questions showcase unique, advanced supramolecular chemistry contexts, *not* textbook templates.
- Each question expects a **single, well-defined numerical answer** or a precise value, not a compound or ambiguous range.
- Required answers universally demand **multi-step quantitative reasoning**, often blending data with theory, not just plug-and-chug.
- **Units** and **formatting** are handled well in text and formulas; chemical nomenclature (where used) is accurate.
- There is **no extraneous, irrelevant information**; questions are tightly focused.

### Opportunities for improvement (aligned to your guidelines):

#### 1. Model a Chemistry Scenario
- **Strength**: All questions ground themselves in HQM (hypervalent iodine macrocycles) chemistry, with real physical values.
- **Opportunity**: Occasionally, the "macrocycle" context could be further clarified for clarity to those unfamiliar with HIMs. For example, in some questions, the "macrocycle" is simply a black box, and could gain from a 1-sentence context elaboration as setup.

#### 2. Numerical Values/Units
- **Strength**: Units and number requests are clear.
- **Opportunity**: Specify more consistently if a sign is required (e.g., "Provide your answer as a signed value...")—do this for all enthalpy/energy questions for clarity.
- **Opportunity**: For percentages, specify "increase" or "decrease" and the direction in the text, for unambiguous interpretation.

#### 3. Multi-Step Reasoning
- **Strength**: All require synthesis of several steps (conversions, plugging into exponentials, etc.).
- **No improvement needed here.**

#### 4. Redundancy
- **Strength**: No redundant data.
- **No improvement needed here.**

#### 5. Uniqueness
- **Strength**: All are original, non-textbook scenarios.
- **No improvement needed.**

#### 6. Single Solution
- **Strength**: Each question asks for exactly one value, with sufficient significant digits, etc.
- **No improvement needed.**

#### 7. Rigorous, Concise Phrasing
- **Strength**: Language is formal, concise, technical.
- **Opportunity**: Sharpen instance phrasing for physical meaning: e.g., in Q2, clarify if I···O is a contact or a bond; "separation" is fine, but "contact distance" may add clarity.

#### 8. Avoid Ambiguous/Colloquial Terminology
- **Strength**: Plain technical English is used.
- **Opportunity**: Replace "minimum approach" with "contact distance" or "closest approach" if compatible with accepted usage.

#### 9. Units Consistency/Chemical Nomenclature
- **Strength**: Good throughout.
- **No improvement needed.**

#### 10. Single-Part Questions Only
- **Strength**: Each question addresses only one calculated/measured result.
- **No improvement needed.**

#### 11. LaTeX/Markdown Formatting
- **Strength**: All formulas and variables are formatted using Markdown LaTeX with $ and $$.
- **No improvement needed.**

## Individual Question Comments (if applicable):

**Q2 (I···O separation and vdW radii):**  
- Phrase could be improved for clarity: "Calculate the percentage reduction of this distance *relative to the sum of the van der Waals radii*." Some students might get confused. Rephrase as "Calculate the percentage by which the observed I···O separation is shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii."

**Q3 (Li–O–I angle, hard sphere):**  
- The phrase "atoms/ions are tangent at their minimum approach" is good, but "minimum approach" is slightly vague—use "contact distance" or "tangent contact".

**Q6 (Lennard-Jones 12th power):**  
- Good, but clarify that only the **repulsive** term is considered and not the overall energy minimum, as this may be a point of confusion.

**Q9 (Percent increase of bond length):**  
- Equation is correct, but prompt could reinforce: "Express as a positive value if the bond length increases."

**Q10 (Binding constant and entropy):**  
- "Molar entropy change" is fine, but in strict thermodynamics, $\Delta S^\circ$ is the standard entropy change—consider using this notation for precision.

## **Actionable Edits**

1. **Clarify Chemical Context**: In Q1 or Q2, a one-sentence description of "HIM" could orient unfamiliar solvers (e.g., "A hypervalent iodine macrocycle (HIM) is a large ring molecule containing iodine in a high oxidation state...").
2. **Percentages**: Always state if percent is "increase" or "decrease" and specify the direction.
3. **Contact vs. Approach**: Replace "minimum approach" with "contact distance" and "separation" with "contact" in geometrical questions.
4. **Signed Answers**: For enthalpy or free energy, always specify signed answer required.
5. **Precision in Notation**: For entropy, use $\Delta S^\circ$ if referring to standard value.

### **Sample Improved Prompt (for Q2):**
> In the crystal structure of a HIM–sodium complex, secondary iodine–oxygen contacts produce an average I···O contact distance of 2.85 Å. Given the van der Waals radii of iodine (1.98 Å) and oxygen (1.52 Å), by what percentage is this contact shorter than the sum of their van der Waals radii? Express your answer as a positive percentage with two decimal places.

**In summary:**  
Your questions are strong, rigorous, and closely aligned to your guidelines. Make minor adjustments for clarity in phrasing ("contact" vs. "separation"), percentage direction, and consistent notation. Consider brief context-setting where advanced terminology ("HIM") is used without explanation.

<question>  
A hypervalent iodine macrocycle (HIM) is a large ring molecule containing iodine in a high oxidation state that can coordinate metal cations. A HIM forms supramolecular complexes with Li⁺ (binding energy –215 kJ·mol⁻¹) and Na⁺ (binding energy –178 kJ·mol⁻¹). Assuming the difference in binding energy arises solely from enthalpy with negligible entropy change, calculate the equilibrium constant ratio  
$$ \frac{K_{\text{Li}}}{K_{\text{Na}}} $$  
at 298 K, where \( K = \exp(-\Delta G^\circ / RT) \). Use \( R = 8.314\, \text{J·mol}^{-1}\text{K}^{-1} \). Express your answer with three significant figures. Provide a positive, dimensionless value.
