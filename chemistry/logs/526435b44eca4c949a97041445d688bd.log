<question>  
A smartphone camera sensor records the RGB values of a colored aqueous solution as (R, G, B) = (120, 85, 70) on an 8-bit scale. A spectrophotometer measures the absorbance of the solution at three wavelengths: 450 nm, 550 nm, and 650 nm, giving values (A₄₅₀, A₅₅₀, A₆₅₀) = (0.35, 0.27, 0.10). Assuming a linear relationship between absorbance and the corrected RGB intensities after matrix-based color correction:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
R_c \\
G_c \\
B_c
\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
0.85 & 0.07 & -0.02 \\
0.12 & 0.91 & 0.03 \\
-0.03 & 0.02 & 0.95
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
R \\
G \\
B
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Calculate the corrected $R_c$ value, and estimate the concentration $c$ (in mol·L⁻¹) of a solute with molar absorptivity $\varepsilon_{450} = 12000$ L·mol⁻¹·cm⁻¹ assuming a 1 cm path length, using the corrected RGB values and spectrophotometer data.

<question>  
During dynamic color correction of a video analyzing a pH indicator solution using a smartphone, the observed RGB values of the indicator at frame 1 are (90, 140, 60) and at frame 50 (135, 190, 110). Given the color gamut is limited by the smartphone sensor's maximum channel value of 255, and the dynamic correction applies the transformation:

$$
(R', G', B') = \frac{255}{\max(R, G, B)} (R, G, B)
$$

Calculate the corrected RGB values $(R', G', B')$ for frame 50 and determine if any channel reaches the saturation limit during correction.  

</question>

<question>  
A matrix-based color correction method transforms smartphone RGB output $(R,G,B)$ using a $3 \times 3$ matrix to match spectrophotometer-measured tristimulus values $X, Y, Z$. Given a measured RGB vector $\mathbf{v} = (180, 120, 105)$, and the transformation matrix:  

$$
M = \begin{pmatrix}
0.4 & 0.3 & 0.1 \\
0.2 & 0.6 & 0.1 \\
0.1 & 0.2 & 0.7
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Compute the corrected tristimulus value $Y$ and convert it to luminance $L$ in cd·m⁻², assuming $L = 116 \times (Y/100)^{1/3} - 16$. Provide $L$ rounded to one decimal place.  

</question>

<question>  
In smartphone-based colorimetric analysis, the incident illumination spectrum shifts due to varying sunlight conditions. Assuming the initial illumination spectrum $I_0(\lambda)$ yields a measured RGB vector $\mathbf{v_0} = (150, 130, 100)$ for a dye solution, while the altered illumination spectrum $I_1(\lambda)$ induces a measurement $\mathbf{v_1} = (120, 110, 80)$. Using the matrix color correction method below:

$$
\mathbf{v_{\text{corrected}}} = M \times \mathbf{v_1}, \quad \text{with} \quad M = \operatorname{diag}\left(\frac{v_{0,R}}{v_{1,R}}, \frac{v_{0,G}}{v_{1,G}}, \frac{v_{0,B}}{v_{1,B}}\right),
$$

find the corrected blue channel $v_{\text{corrected},B}$ value for the altered illumination measurement.  

</question>

<question>  
A colored solution analyzed by a smartphone under mixed illumination yields raw RGB intensities at a given pixel as $(100, 150, 120)$. The spectral interference from background fluorescence distorts the true color by adding a constant offset $(15, 20, 10)$ to each channel. If matrix-based correction applies the inverse of matrix

$$
N = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

to the offset-subtracted RGB vector, calculate the corrected RGB vector after subtracting fluorescence and applying matrix $N^{-1}$.

=== Turn 0: Critic feedback ===
Here’s a detailed critique of each question according to your 11-point guideline, with actionable suggestions for improvement:

---

**Question 1**

**Critique:**
- **Strengths:** Realistic scenario, asks for numeric values, multi-step (matrix application + concentration from absorbance), units mentioned.
- **Issues:**
  - **Multiple Parts:** Asks for *both* a matrix-corrected $R_c$ **and** a concentration. This violates guideline 10 (single solution).
  - **Units for $R_c$:** It's unclear what units $R_c$ should have—absolute intensity? No guidance on normalization/format or units.
  - **Ambiguity:** Lacks specificity—should concentration be based *solely* on $A_{450}$? Is $R_c$ necessary to answer the concentration? The relationship between corrected RGB and absorbance is not explicitly defined for quantification.
  - **Extraneous detail:** Providing all $A_{450}$, $A_{550}$, $A_{650}$ seems unnecessary if only $A_{450}$ and $\varepsilon_{450}$ are used.

**Suggestions:**
- Focus the question on *either* the matrix correction *or* the concentration calculation, not both.
- Clearly specify which value is to be calculated.
- Remove unnecessary data. If only $A_{450}$ and $R_c$ are relevant, exclude the rest.
- Define what units/form $R_c$ should be reported in.
- Clarify if the absorbance calculation should *use* the corrected $R_c$ or the spectrophotometer value.

---

**Question 2**

**Critique:**
- **Strengths:** Realistic, unique, asks for numeric (corrected RGB values), enforces stepwise calculation.
- **Issues:**
  - **Multiple Parts:** Asks for *all* three corrected RGB values *and* to assess saturation; there should be only one answer (guideline 10).
  - **Ambiguity:** The phrase "determine if any channel reaches the saturation limit" could be made more concrete—do you want the *name* of a channel, a Boolean ("yes"/"no"), or a value?
  - **Units:** RGB values need to be clearly stated as unitless integers (0–255).
  - **Redundancy:** Providing both frames’ RGB values is fine, but referencing "frame 1" may be extraneous if it's not used in the calculation.

**Suggestions:**
- Ask for the *highest* corrected channel value *or* a single corrected value (e.g., only $R'$ for frame 50).
- Phrase the question to have a single numerically-scored answer (e.g., "What is the corrected $G'$ value for frame 50, rounded to the nearest integer?").
- Alternatively, if testing limit detection, phrase it as "Does any corrected channel in frame 50 reach 255 after transformation? Answer 'yes' or 'no'."

---

**Question 3**

**Critique:**
- **Strengths:** Real-world setup, unique (matrix transformation), multi-step (matrix multiplication + nonlinear conversion), single output ($L$), uses correct units.
- **Issues:**
  - **Units on $Y$:** Make it explicit what the units are for $Y$ and $L$.
  - **Redundancy:** Reference to "tristimulus values $X, Y, Z$" is not strictly necessary, since only $Y$ is used.
  - **Phrasing:** Avoid "Compute" as the first word; start with "Given..." and directly request the final value.
  - **Over-specification:** "Provide $L$ rounded to one decimal place" is good, but state the units for $L$.

**Suggestions:**
- Directly ask: "Calculate the luminance $L$ (in cd·m⁻²) corresponding to the corrected value $Y$, rounded to one decimal place."
- Clarify initial units as needed.

---

**Question 4**

**Critique:**
- **Strengths:** Interesting, relevant scenario, tests matrix application, asks for a single (numeric) channel value.
- **Issues:**
  - **Units:** RGB values should explicitly be referred to as unitless or as 8-bit integer values.
  - **Over-notation:** Notation $v_{\text{corrected}, B}$ can be confusing; state explicitly: "What is the corrected blue channel value?"
  - **Ordering:** Math notation could be tightened; the equation could be derived stepwise for clarity.

**Suggestions:**
- Rephrase: "Calculate the corrected blue channel value after matrix-based correction, using the given RGB measurements. Express your answer as an integer."
- State expected units or value type.

---

**Question 5**

**Critique:**
- **Strengths:** Concrete real-world issue (fluorescent offset), asks for a clear result (corrected vector), units clear.
- **Issues:**
  - **Trivial Matrix:** Matrix $N$ is the identity, so $N^{-1}$ is also identity; this makes matrix application redundant.
  - **Multiple Steps:** While two steps (subtract, then matrix), the second is trivialized.
  - **Multiple Answers:** If the full vector is required, that's OK as a single answer (as in "What is the corrected RGB vector?").
  - **Redundancy:** Telling the student to apply $N^{-1}$ is unnecessary since it's the identity.

**Suggestions:**
- Make the matrix nontrivial to require a meaningful calculation (e.g., an actual color correction matrix).
- Otherwise, ask directly for the offset-corrected vector without mentioning a matrix, or use a nontrivial transformation.
- If you require the full vector, specify the reporting format: "Report the corrected RGB vector as three integers separated by commas."

---

**Overall Recommendations:**

1. **Avoid multi-part questions:** Ensure each question requires *only one* answer—either a computed number or a chemical compound name, not both.
2. **Prune unnecessary context/data:** Include only the details and numbers directly relevant to the answer.
3. **Clarify units** for all outputs, and specify formatting (e.g., rounding, integer reporting where needed).
4. **Avoid trivial operations** (e.g., identity matrices) and ensure all calculations require meaningful reasoning.
5. **Phrase for precision:** Start with "Given..." and focus on action verbs like "Calculate", "Determine", or "State".
6. **Remove ambiguous checks:** If asking for “if” conditions (e.g., saturation), phrase as a direct "Answer 'yes' or 'no'", or ask for the value that demonstrates the threshold is reached.
7. **Maintain chemical focus:** Include, where appropriate, compound names and units per IUPAC recommendations, and relevant chemical context.
8. **Unique and complex:** Ensure each question is not a routine textbook example, but leverages the scenario’s specialty (e.g., smartphone/sensor/matrix interplay).

**Summary Table:**

| Q# | Issues | Suggestions |
|----|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Multi-part, ambiguous units, unnecessary data | Single calculation, clear units, tighter phrasing |
| 2 | Multi-part, ambiguous output | Request one specific value; clarify output format |
| 3 | Slight redundancy, unclear units | Direct phrasing, specify units in wording |
| 4 | Notation, units | Ask for one channel, clarify answer type |
| 5 | Trivial matrix, redundancy | Use nontrivial matrix or skip step; clarify answer format |


**General Action:**  
Rewrite each question so that it unambiguously asks for a single numerical value (with specified units/format), leverages all provided data for the answer, and contains only context essential to reasoning about the solution.

Here’s a concise, actionable critique based on your guidelines for each question:

---

### General Observations

- **Chemistry Context:** All questions are set within the scenario of smartphone analysis of liquid-phase colors (e.g., dyes/indicators)—this is an applied chemistry context but rather technical/analytical, not covering chemical identities, reactions, or mechanisms.
- **Rigour & Uniqueness:** The mathematical processing is rigorous and requires multi-step calculations; they are not generic textbook examples.
- **Clarity:** All equations are correctly rendered in LaTeX for Markdown.

---

## Question 1

> A smartphone camera sensor records the RGB values of a colored aqueous solution as $(R, G, B) = (120, 85, 70)$ ... calculate the corrected red channel value $R_c$ ... as a decimal rounded to one decimal place.

**Feedback:**
1. **Chemistry context:** Acceptable, as colored solution analysis is common; could slightly strengthen by specifying the chemical nature of the solution (e.g., "A potassium permanganate solution").
2. **Single solution:** Yes; only $R_c$ is sought.
3. **Units/Terminology:** Lacks explicit unit for the channel (should state "unitless" or "arbitrary units (a.u.)").
4. **Conciseness:** Clear, not verbose.
5. **Action:** Add context about which chemical analyte or process is being studied, or mention analytical purpose (e.g., concentration measurement). Specify units for clarity.

---

## Question 2

> During dynamic color correction of a video analyzing a pH indicator solution, the smartphone captures RGB values ... Calculate the corrected green channel value $G'$ ... Round your answer to the nearest integer.

**Feedback:**
1. **Chemistry context:** Adequate—uses pH indicator—but could specify which indicator and why frame 50 matters (e.g., titration endpoint).
2. **Single solution:** Yes; only $G'$ is requested.
3. **Units:** No units specified for $G'$. Clarify usage—should it be "a.u."?
4. **Multi-step reasoning:** Satisfactory; requires max finding, scaling, and rounding.
5. **Action:** Link more explicitly to chemical relevance (e.g., "to monitor pH change in a titration"). Specify units.

---

## Question 3

> A smartphone RGB vector $\mathbf{v} = (180, 120, 105)$ ... calculate the luminance $L$ (in cd·m⁻²) from the corrected $Y$ value ... Provide $L$ rounded to one decimal place.

**Feedback:**
1. **Chemistry context:** Weak—no explicit chemical scenario (just "a smartphone RGB vector"). Specify what the sample is (dye, indicator, etc.).
2. **Single solution:** Yes.
3. **Units:** Good, as $L$ is in $\mathrm{cd}\cdot\mathrm{m}^{-2}$.
4. **Multi-step reasoning:** Strong.
5. **Action:** Introduce a chemical context for the sample (e.g., name the dye or reaction monitored). Ensure it models an actual experiment.

---

## Question 4

> A dye solution measured ... initial illumination ... ... under altered illumination ... Calculate the corrected blue channel value $v_{\text{corrected},B}$. Report your answer as an integer.

**Feedback:**
1. **Chemistry context:** Clear—"dye solution" and illumination change (covers environmental effect on measurement).
2. **Single solution:** Yes.
3. **Conciseness:** Clear.
4. **Units:** No explicit units for the channel—should specify "a.u." or similar.
5. **Action:** Specify which dye or system is used for greater chemical specificity. Add units for $v_{\text{corrected},B}$.

---

## Question 5

> A smartphone measures raw RGB intensities ... background fluorescence adds a constant offset ... After subtracting this offset, ... applying $N^{-1}$... Report your answer as three integers separated by commas.

**Feedback:**
1. **Chemistry context:** Good—background fluorescence is a real analytical problem. However, you could specify the fluorophore or system for greater depth.
2. **Single solution:** Yes.
3. **Units:** Lacks specification ("intensities" should be in "a.u." or similar).
4. **Complexity:** Involves background subtraction and matrix inversion—excellent for multi-step reasoning.
5. **Action:** Include a specific analyte or experiment (e.g., "fluorescence of resorufin in presence of background"). Clarify units.

---

## Additional Global Issues & Action Steps

### 1. Real Chemistry Depth
- All questions would be stronger with explicit mention of the analyte, dye, or chemical system, e.g., "malachite green solution," "bromothymol blue indicator," etc. This improves scenario authenticity per Guideline 1.

### 2. Units Consistency
- For RGB channel values, specify units (typically "arbitrary units" or "a.u.").
- Even if the values are dimensionless, state "unitless" so students know you considered this issue.

### 3. Chemical Nomenclature
- No compounds are named, so this is moot here, but if the scenario involved a chemical product, ensure IUPAC nomenclature.

### 4. Force Chemistry Reasoning
- While multi-step calculations are enforced, chemical reasoning is minimal—these are colorimetry/data processing tasks rather than chemically mechanistic problems. Consider including a step that connects the corrected value to a chemical property (e.g., relate $R_c$ to absorbance or concentration via Beer-Lambert Law).

### 5. Solution Formatting
- Equations and numbers are in proper Markdown/LaTeX syntax throughout.

## **Concrete Recommendations**

1. **Always specify the chemistry context** with an explicit analyte, dye, or chemical process.
2. **Always specify units** for all reported numerical answers (e.g., “in arbitrary units (a.u.)” for RGB).
3. **Link the corrected values to a chemical property or application**, even if briefly (e.g., “to determine the concentration of X via Beer-Lambert Law”).
4. **State the task as measuring or processing real experimental data**, not just a vector transformation.
5. **Ensure each question includes one single answerable value**, which all do.
6. **Preserve LaTeX formatting** as in your draft.

**In summary:** These questions are strong in technical rigor but need more explicit, detailed chemistry context (what, why), and better units specification to fully align with the provided guidelines.

$$
(R', G', B') = \frac{255}{\max(R, G, B)} (R, G, B).
$$

Calculate the corrected green channel value \( G' \) (in a.u.) at frame 50 after scaling. Round your answer to the nearest integer. The corrected value aids in evaluating the pH-dependent color change of the indicator.  
</question>

<question>  
A smartphone records RGB values \(\mathbf{v} = (180, 120, 105)\) (8-bit scale, a.u.) from a **malachite green dye solution** under test conditions. The RGB vector is transformed into CIE tristimulus values \((X, Y, Z)\) by matrix multiplication:

$$
M = \begin{pmatrix}
0.4 & 0.3 & 0.1 \\
0.2 & 0.6 & 0.1 \\
0.1 & 0.2 & 0.7
\end{pmatrix}, \quad (X,Y,Z) = M \times \mathbf{v}.
$$

The luminance \(L\) (cd·m\(^{-2}\)) of the solution’s apparent color is then calculated from \(Y\) by:

$$
L = 116 \times \left(\frac{Y}{100}\right)^{1/3} - 16.

$$

is applied as \(\mathbf{v}_{\text{corrected}} = M \times \mathbf{v}_1\).

Calculate the corrected blue channel value \(v_{\text{corrected}, B}\) (in a.u.) after illumination normalization. Report your answer as an integer.  
</question>

<question>  
A smartphone measures raw RGB intensities of a **resorufin fluorescent dye solution** as \((100, 150, 120)\) (8-bit scale, a.u.). Background fluorescence adds a constant offset of \((15, 20, 10)\) a.u. to each channel, distorting the true signal. To correct:

1. Subtract the background fluorescence offset from the raw RGB values.
2. Then apply the inverse of the correction matrix

$$
N = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 2
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

Calculate the corrected RGB vector (in a.u.) after these steps. Report your answer as three integers separated by commas. Corrected values allow more accurate quantification of dye concentration by fluorescence intensity.

=== Turn 2: Critic feedback ===
**General Feedback:**  
These questions are *strong* in modeling modern chemistry scenarios with instrumentation (smartphone-based colorimetry), expect numerical reasoning, and leverage matrix/vector calculations—well beyond typical textbook examples. They mostly require multi-step calculations and result in a single answer. Phrasing is largely rigorous. Below is detailed, actionable feedback for each question, tied to your rubric.

---

### First Question (Potassium permanganate, color correction matrix)
**Strengths:**
- **Models** a realistic chemistry setup (color analysis of an aqueous solution).
- **Numerical answer** required, clear rounding instructions, and consistent units.
- **Multi-step reasoning** is required (matrix multiplication).
- **Rigorous, concise phrasing.**

**Areas to Improve:**
- The phrase "values in arbitrary units, a.u." is fine, but standardize its inclusion (see rest).
- “This corrected value helps estimate the solution concentration via absorbance calculations.” — Slightly extraneous for the calculation, but does add reasonable context. Still appropriately concise.
- "8-bit scale, values in arbitrary units, a.u." — Consider rephrasing for clarity: "8-bit scale (arbitrary units, a.u.)".
- The phrase "Report your answer as a decimal rounded to one decimal place." could be more direct: "Round your answer to one decimal place."

**Actionable Edits:**  
- Minor: Ensure consistent and concise unit/scale descriptions across all questions.
---

### Second Question (Bromothymol blue, illumination scaling)
**Strengths:**
- **Chemistry scenario** is relevant and clear (titration/indicator color change).
- **Numerical, unambiguous answer**.
- **Multi-step calculation** (find $\max$, scale, extract component).
- **Unique**—not a textbook-standard example.

**Areas to Improve:**
- The context sentence "The corrected value aids in evaluating the pH-dependent color change..." is slightly tangential.
- Instead of "at frame 50," state "at video frame 50" up front for clarity.
- Specify units directly in the answer line: "...corrected green channel value $G'$ (arbitrary units, a.u.)..."

**Actionable Edits:**  
- Streamline context to focus on calculation; if needed, keep only the most relevant phrase.
- Standardize description of units.
---

### Third Question (Malachite green, CIE transformation & luminance)
**Strengths:**
- **Rigorously models** a plausible analytical scenario.
- **Multi-step reasoning** (matrix transform, then nonlinear luminance formula).
- **Clear instructions** on result rounding.

**Areas to Improve:**
- The sentence "Understanding luminance changes..." is contextually relevant, but could be omitted for brevity if tightness is a priority.
- Units for luminance ("cd·m$^{-2}$") are appropriate, but consider: since units are based on $Y$ component, make sure the question is clear that the $Y$ is in the appropriate form with compatible units—otherwise, remind that RGBs are in arbitrary units, and the result for $L$ is in "arbitrary units" for comparison.

**Actionable Edits:**  
- If $Y$ does not correspond to actual luminance units, clarify that $L$ will be in arbitrary units.
- Consider omitting the "Understanding..." sentence for rigor.
---

### Fourth Question (Crystal violet, illumination normalization via diagonal matrix)
**Strengths:**
- **Unique scenario** involving correction for illumination in colorimetry.
- **Numerical, single-answer, single-step solution** after calculation.
- **Mathematically rigorous** setup.

**Areas to Improve:**
- Minor unit ambiguity: clarify "a.u." every time you quote an RGB value.
- “After illumination normalization” is somewhat redundant if the rest of the setup is clear.

**Actionable Edits:**  
- Be more explicit in the answer line: "...corrected blue channel value $v_{\text{corrected},B}$ (a.u.)..."
---

### Fifth Question (Resorufin, background subtraction + inverse correction)
**Strengths:**
- **Multi-step calculation** is clearly specified (background subtraction, then matrix inverse).
- **Numerical integer answers**, clear formatting of output.
- **Unique and rigorous scenario.**

**Areas to Improve:**
- Make clear that after subtraction the values are to be used as inputs for the matrix operation.
- Units for all vectors should always be stated.
- The word "offset" is used correctly, but could specify it's "to each channel" for absolute clarity.
- Make the answer formatting *bulletproof*: "Report your answer as three integers separated by commas (e.g., 50, 80, 30)."

**Actionable Edits:**  
- Add a parenthetical example of formatted answer.
- Be explicit about unit conventions.

---

## **Overall Recommendations**

- **Standardize units phrasing**: Always include "(arbitrary units, a.u.)" at first mention of values and every time after calculations.
- **Keep context sentences concise**: A single (optional) sentence may follow for real-world contextualization, but ensure it is directly relevant and does not repeat between questions.
- **Question phrasing**: Instruct answer formatting directly (e.g., "Report your answer as..."), with examples if multi-value outputs are required.
- **Avoid minor redundancy in phrases** like "after normalization"—if normalizing is described in the calculation, that's sufficient.
- **Keep only necessary context**: Omit phrases that do not add to the solution process.
- **Consistency**: Use the same format, tense, and level of detail for all questions.
- **Highlight uniqueness**: All scenarios are original and experimental in design; good use of complex matrix operations.
  
**Summary Table (per rubric):**

| Guideline | Met? | Comments |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Chemistry Scenario | Yes | Modern, relevant, non-textbook scenarios. |
| Answer Type | Yes | Single, numerical, with stated rounding. |
| Multi-step Reasoning | Yes | All require >1 calculation step. |
| Redundancy | Mostly | A few minor context sentences could be tighter. |
| Uniqueness | Yes | Not standard textbook examples. |
| Single Solution | Yes | Only one answer per prompt. |
| Concise, Rigorous | Mostly | Some room for tightening context. |
| No Ambiguity | Yes | No colloquial/ambiguous phrasing. |
| Units | Mostly | Standardize unit phrases. |
| Single-part Q | Yes | Each asks for only one result. |

<question>  
A smartphone camera sensor records the RGB values of a **potassium permanganate aqueous solution** as \((R, G, B) = (120, 85, 70)\) (8-bit scale, arbitrary units, a.u.). To correct for sensor color bias, the following color correction matrix is applied:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
R_c \\
G_c \\
B_c
\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
0.85 & 0.07 & -0.02 \\
0.12 & 0.91 & 0.03 \\
-0.03 & 0.02 & 0.95
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
R \\
G \\
B
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

Calculate the corrected red channel value \( R_c \) (arbitrary units, a.u.). Round your answer to one decimal place.

<question>  
During a titration of **bromothymol blue solution** monitored by smartphone, the RGB values at video frame 50 are \((R, G, B) = (135, 190, 110)\) (8-bit scale, arbitrary units, a.u.). To correct for varying illumination intensity, saturation scaling is applied:

$$
(R', G', B') = \frac{255}{\max(R, G, B)} (R, G, B).
$$

Calculate the corrected green channel value \( G' \) (arbitrary units, a.u.) at video frame 50 after scaling. Round your answer to the nearest integer.

<question>  
A smartphone records RGB values \(\mathbf{v} = (180, 120, 105)\) (8-bit scale, arbitrary units, a.u.) from a **malachite green dye solution** under test conditions. The RGB vector is transformed into CIE tristimulus values \((X, Y, Z)\) by matrix multiplication:

$$
M = \begin{pmatrix}
0.4 & 0.3 & 0.1 \\
0.2 & 0.6 & 0.1 \\
0.1 & 0.2 & 0.7
\end{pmatrix}, \quad (X, Y, Z) = M \times \mathbf{v}.
$$

The luminance \(L\) (arbitrary units, a.u.) of the solution’s apparent color is calculated from \(Y\) by:

$$
L = 116 \times \left(\frac{Y}{100}\right)^{1/3} - 16.
$$

Calculate \(L\) rounded to one decimal place.

<question>  
A **crystal violet dye solution** measured by smartphone yields initial RGB values \(\mathbf{v}_0 = (150, 130, 100)\) and later values \(\mathbf{v}_1 = (120, 110, 80)\) (8-bit scale, arbitrary units, a.u.) under lower illumination. To correct for illumination variation, the diagonal correction matrix

$$
M = \operatorname{diag}\left(\frac{v_{0,R}}{v_{1,R}},\, \frac{v_{0,G}}{v_{1,G}},\, \frac{v_{0,B}}{v_{1,B}}\right)
$$

is applied as \(\mathbf{v}_{\text{corrected}} = M \times \mathbf{v}_1\).

Calculate the corrected blue channel value \(v_{\text{corrected}, B}\) (arbitrary units, a.u.). Round your answer to the nearest integer.  
</question>

<question>  
A smartphone measures raw RGB intensities of a **resorufin fluorescent dye solution** as \((100, 150, 120)\) (8-bit scale, arbitrary units, a.u.). Background fluorescence adds a constant offset of \((15, 20, 10)\) (a.u.) to each channel, distorting the true signal. To correct these measurements:

1. Subtract the background fluorescence offset from the raw RGB values.
2. Then apply the inverse of the correction matrix

$$
N = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 2
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

Calculate the corrected RGB vector (arbitrary units, a.u.) after these steps. Report your answer as three integers separated by commas (e.g., 50, 80, 30).
