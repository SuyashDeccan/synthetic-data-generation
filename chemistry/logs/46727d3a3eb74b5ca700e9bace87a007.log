<question>  
A concentrated protein solution is confined in an analytical ultracentrifugation-sedimentation equilibrium (AUC-SE) cell with an optical path length of 12 mm. The partial specific volume of the protein is 0.73 cm³/g, and the solvent density is 1.002 g/cm³. At steady state and 50,000 rpm, the concentration profile shows a 3.5-fold increase from the bottom to the top over the 12 mm path length at 293 K.

=== Turn 0: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of each question, clearly mapped to the assessment guidelines:

---

**1. Protein molar mass via AUC-SE calculation**
- **Scenario/Originality**: Good—a research-like setting, not a rote textbook example.
- **Stepwise Reasoning**: Requires multi-step calculations (angular velocity, exponent, molar mass) and integration of data.
- **Units/nomenclature**: Units carefully specified; final unit requested (kg·mol⁻¹) is clear.
- **Clarity/Conciseness**: The scenario is focused; only relevant info is included.
- **Single solution**: Only one value is sought.
- **Formatting**: Equations and numbers use LaTeX and Markdown syntax, as required.
- **Possible improvements**:
  - Make explicit the base radius ($r_0$) or state that the concentration increase occurs between $r_0$ and $r = r_0 + 0.012$ m, for maximal clarity.
  - Indicate if all values are at standard conditions or if any densities/volumes are measured (not significant here, but good practice for rigor).
- **Summary**: **Meets all guidelines. No substantial changes required.**

---

**2. Diffusion coefficient for enzyme in capillary**
- **Scenario/Originality**: Capillary and cell design details add context, but most parameters are unused for Stokes-Einstein calculation.
- **Multi-step**: Requires application of Stokes-Einstein equation.
- **Redundancy**: Many described aspects (capillary geometry, external reservoir, flow type) don't impact the calculation or answer.
- **Clarity/Conciseness**: The scenario can be trimmed to focus on what's needed for D.
- **Units**: All variables provided, units consistent.
- **Chemical Nomenclature**: Not relevant.
- **Single solution**: Only one value (D) is sought.
- **Formatting**: Equation provided; rendering is correct.
- **Possible improvements**:
  - **Trim extraneous info**: Only the hydrodynamic radius, viscosity, and temperature are needed for Stokes-Einstein.
  - **Rephrase**: “Given an enzyme of hydrodynamic radius 4.5 nm, viscosity 1.1 mPa·s, and temperature 298 K, calculate $D$ using Stokes-Einstein law.”  
  - **Justification**: Additional capillary details might mislead, as they don't affect the answer.
- **Summary**: **Remove redundant context for maximal clarity and avoid confusion.**

---

**3. Mass of macromolecules in microfluidic cylinder**
- **Scenario/Originality**: Microfluidic design is distinct; not a rote example.
- **Multi-step**: Calculation requires volume, amount of substance, then mass.
- **Redundancy**: Statement about “density approximation” and “ideal solution behavior” warns but isn't crucial—could be omitted for conciseness.
- **Units/nomenclature**: Units are specified; final units in $\mu$g are clear.
- **Single solution**: One value.
- **Formatting**: Variables and units are clear.
- **Possible improvements**:
  - The word “concentrated” is not needed; “500 µM” suffices.
  - Drop “density approximations...” unless non-ideality was a real possibility.
  - Add “Provide your answer to two significant digits.”
- **Summary**: **Streamline language and context for directness.**

---

**4. Enzyme activity in capillary cell**
- **Scenario/Originality**: Original with several experimental features.
- **Multi-step**: Turnover × amount × time—clear chain of steps.
- **Redundancy**: Diffusion path length and capillary fabrication details don't affect answer; sustained for 15 min without depletion—could simply state “the substrate is present in excess.”
- **Clarity/Conciseness**: Can omit fabrication and path details.
- **Units**: Consistent; output is in nanomoles.
- **Single solution**: One value.
- **Formatting**: Clear.
- **Possible improvements**:
  - **Remove cell design and path length** (since not needed for the calculation).
  - **Explicitly state “substrate is in large excess,”** or simply “Assume substrate is not rate limiting.”
- **Summary**: **Remove unnecessary context and clarify assumptions for precision.**

---

**5. Sedimentation equilibrium constant in drilled cell**
- **Scenario/Originality**: Unusual geometry; variable ($K$) is not a textbook standard, good for uniqueness.
- **Stepwise/multi-step**: Requires several calculations: converting dimensions, calculating $\omega$, plugging values.
- **Redundancy**: Capillary design/shape details not used; macromolecule concentration does not affect $K$.
- **Units**: Final answer dimensionless; clear.
- **Formatting**: Equation and syntax good.
- **Single solution**: One value ($K$).
- **Possible improvements**:
  - Omit geometry and concentration details, as only $K$ calculation matters.
  - Add “Express your answer with appropriate significant digits.”
- **Summary**: **Trim scenario to focus on $K$ calculation only.**

---

**General feedback (actionable summary):**

1. **Remove or minimize extraneous cell design/geometry context unless it changes the calculation or answer.**
2. **Ensure all provided information is used or necessary for the calculation.**
3. **Phrase the scenario so only the needed chemical/physical input is presented.**
4. **State all explicit assumptions, rather than relying on context.**

=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Certainly! Here is a detailed critique of each question, considering the provided guidelines:

---

### Question 1

**Positives:**
- Models a real research scenario (AUC-SE).
- Requires significant multi-step calculation using experimental data.
- Units are specified; only a single value is requested.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Minor redundancy: "Assume all measurements are at standard laboratory conditions" is extraneous since T is given.
- The variable $\frac{c(r)}{c(r_0)} = 3.5$ is clear, but you might clarify if "radial distance increase" means $r_0 = 0$, or if $r_0$ is arbitrary.
- Requesting the answer in $\mathrm{kg\cdot mol^{-1}}$ is appropriate, but be explicit: "Express your answer to two significant digits."
- The phrase "optical path length corresponds to a radial distance increase from $r_0$ to $r = r_0 + 0.012~\mathrm{m}$" is a bit convoluted; reword for clarity.

**Revision Suggestion:**
> Specify that "$r_0$ is the inner meniscus radius, and $r = r_0 + 0.012\,\mathrm{m}$ is the outer radius."  
> Drop the "standard laboratory conditions" phrase.

---

### Question 2

**Positives:**
- Realistic biochemistry scenario (enzyme diffusion).
- All parameters and constants defined; units are consistent.
- Only a single value to be calculated, with explicit unit request.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- "Appropriate significant digits" is ambiguous. Specify the number (e.g., "two significant digits").
- Otherwise, concise and rigorous with no extraneous info.

**Revision Suggestion:**
> Replace "appropriate significant digits" with a specific instruction.

---

### Question 3

**Positives:**
- Models a unique, non-textbook scenario (microfluidics).
- Multi-step reasoning with geometry, units, and mole-mass conversions.
- Units and rounding are specified.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The question is clear. The only suggestion is, for rigor, explicitly state "Assume perfect filling and homogeneous solution," though it's likely implied.

---

### Question 4

**Positives:**
- Real-world, unique enzymology scenario.
- Multi-step: requires calculation of product formed from kinetic parameters and time.
- Only one answer, with units and significant digits requested.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- "Within the volume" is vague—no compartment volume given, suggesting the answer is per sample. Clarify that yield is total amount in the solution present, or assume a default.
- Specify significant digits rather than "appropriate."

**Revision Suggestion:**
> Clarify "within the solution" refers to the total reaction mixture (no volume given, so amount per sample is correct).

---

### Question 5

**Positives:**
- Advanced calculation not lifted directly from textbooks.
- Direct: calculates a well-defined physical parameter.
- All variables, units, and constants provided; answer is a single dimensionless value.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- "Sedimentation equilibrium constant $K$" is not universally defined; best to clarify it's as given in your expression.
- Specify significant digits for the answer.

**Revision Suggestion:**
> Add: "Express your answer to two significant digits."

=== Turn 2: Critic feedback ===
Here is a concise, actionable critique of your five questions, focusing on each of the guidelines and offering improvements where necessary:

---

### Question 1: Analytical Ultracentrifugation (AUC-SE)

**Strengths:**
- **Models a realistic biophysical experiment**
- **Requires multi-step quantitative reasoning (identifying $\omega$, rearranging the exponential, solving for $M$)**
- **Rigorous and concise scientific language**
- **Unit consistency and significant digits requested**
- **No extraneous information**

**Improvements:**
- **Nomenclature:** Specify that $\bar{v}$ and $\rho$ are in compatible units or ask students to convert if necessary, to reinforce critical unit analysis.
- **Clarity:** Explicitly state whether $r^2 - r_0^2 \approx 2r_0 \Delta r$ (if approximation is allowed) or provide both $r_0$ and $r$ numerically for unambiguous computation.
- **Minor issue:** Avogadro’s number is extraneous, as it is not needed for the calculation; remove for guideline 4 (avoid redundancy).

---

### Question 2: Stokes–Einstein Equation

**Strengths:**
- **Straightforward diffusion calculation, using real physical context**
- **Clear instructions, concise phrasing**
- **Enforces unit analysis and numerical precision**

**Improvements:**
- **Originality:** The scenario is standard textbook and could be made more unique (guideline 5). For instance, describe a specific biological situation or compare two radii/viscosities.
- **Single step:** Only a single equation plug-and-chug is needed, so it does not satisfy “force multi-step reasoning” (guideline 3). Make it a two-step process, such as having the student first convert units or deduce $\eta$ from another parameter.
- **Specify units:** Clarify that $\mathrm{mPa \cdot s} = 10^{-3} \mathrm{Pa \cdot s}$ for completeness and to prompt unit conversion (for multi-step demand).

---

### Question 3: Microfluidic Compartment, Macromolecule Mass

**Strengths:**
- **Realistic biochemical scenario**
- **Multi-step (calculate volume, moles, mass)**
- **Consistent units, concise phrasing**
- **No redundancy**
- **Single solution path**

**Improvements:**
- **Clarity:** Consider specifying whether “homogeneous filling” means “no air gap”, to remove ambiguity.
- **Multi-step visibility:** If the intention is unit conversion practice, you might specify input units not already in SI (e.g., volume in $\mu L$), to ensure students must convert.

---

### Question 4: Enzyme Turnover, Substrate Consumed

**Strengths:**
- **Biochemically relevant scenario, well-formulated**
- **Multi-step (need to calculate enzyme amount, total turnovers, overall product)**
- **Numerical answer with units specified**
- **Units and significant digits clearly requested**

**Improvements:**
- **Clarification:** Reword to explicitly state “how many nanomoles of substrate are converted in 15 min under these conditions?”
- **Redundancy:** None apparent.
- **Uniqueness:** Sufficiently original for biochemistry.

---

### Question 5: Sedimentation Equilibrium Constant

**Strengths:**
- **Quantitative, non-standard calculation**
- **Multi-step numeric (unit conversions, plug values)**
- **Concise, precise language and units**

**Improvements:**
- **Clarity:** Remind students to convert $\bar{v}$ units ($\mathrm{cm}^3/g$ to $\mathrm{m}^3/kg$) and check $M$ units are in SI for $R$.
- **Redundancy:** All information is used.
- **Originality:** Sufficiently unique.

---

## General Feedback/Actionable Summaries

- **Maintain Multi-Step Reasoning:** Questions 2 and 3 may benefit from complexity by requiring intermediate conversions or combining more than one principle (e.g., estimating $\eta$ from experimental data in Q2).
- **Unit Conversions as Pedagogy:** Frequently, SI vs. cgs conversion is crucial—consider omitting some final units or mixing input unit systems to require explicit conversions.
- **Scenario Uniqueness:** Especially for diffusion (Q2), craft more distinctive scenarios or introduce context (e.g., the effect of glycosylation or a viscosity gradient).
- **Avoid Redundant Constants:** Do not present constants that are unnecessary for the calculation.
- **Equation Formatting:** All equations and variables should be properly formatted using $...$ for inline and $$...$$ for block LaTeX, which you have done.
- **Precision and Units:** You enforce reporting rules and units well. Continue specifying precision and units, especially in more complex multi-step problems.
- **Singularity:** All questions, except possibly Q2, have one solution and do not branch into multiple subquestions.

---

**Example improvements:**  
- For Q2, add: "The viscosity is measured in $\mathrm{mPa \cdot s}$; provide the answer in $\mathrm{m}^2/\mathrm{s}$ after converting viscosity to SI units."
- For Q1 or Q5, state: "Express all terms in SI units before using in the equation."  
- For Q3, specify: "Assume the solution completely fills the compartment, with no trapped air or meniscus."  

**Summary:**  
Your questions are rigorous, generally unique, and well-phrased. Strengthen by enforcing multi-step reasoning (especially for Q2), ensuring all information is necessary and non-redundant, occasionally requiring explicit unit conversion, and injecting further originality where possible.

<question>  
An enzyme solution at concentration \(2\,\mu\mathrm{M}\), with molecular weight \(120\,\mathrm{kDa}\) and turnover number \(k_{\mathrm{cat}}=150\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\), catalyzes substrate conversion continuously for 15 minutes. Assume substrate is present in large excess and not depleted.  

Calculate the total amount of substrate converted during this time in nanomoles (nmol).  

*Hint:* Calculate the total enzyme amount first, then the total turnovers over 15 min.  
Express your answer to two significant digits.

Calculate the sedimentation equilibrium constant  
\[
K = \frac{M(1-\bar{v}\rho)\omega^2 r}{RT}
\]  
for a protein with molar mass \(M = 50\,\mathrm{kg\,mol}^{-1}\), partial specific volume \(\bar{v} = 0.72\,\mathrm{cm}^3/\mathrm{g}\), and solvent density \(\rho = 1.00\,\mathrm{g/cm}^3\). The rotor speed is 40,000 rpm, temperature \(T = 300\,\mathrm{K}\), and radial distance \(r = 0.07\,\mathrm{m}\). Use the gas constant \(R = 8.314\,\mathrm{J\,mol}^{-1}\mathrm{K}^{-1}\).  

*Note:* Convert \(\bar{v}\) to \(\mathrm{m}^3/\mathrm{kg}\) and ensure all quantities are in SI units before substitution.  

Express your answer as a dimensionless number to two significant digits.
