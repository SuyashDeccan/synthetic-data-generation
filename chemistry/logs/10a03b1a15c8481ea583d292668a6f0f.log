=== Turn 0: Critic feedback ===
Here is a critique of each question, referencing your guidelines and providing targeted suggestions for improvement.

---

### Question 1

**Strengths:**
- Models a realistic photoactivated supramolecular equilibrium scenario (Guideline 1, 5).
- Requires multiple steps: rate constants $\rightarrow$ equilibrium calculations $\rightarrow$ fraction assembled (Guideline 3).
- Requires precise units and result formatting (Guideline 2, 9, 11).
- Not a standard textbook example; original context (Guideline 5).

**Weaknesses/Improvements:**
- The phrase “fraction of assembled supramolecular polymer” could confuse some students regarding whether it refers to fraction of total monomers present as dimer (recommended: explicitly state “fraction of total monomeric units present as dimer” or “fraction of total monomer converted to dimer species”).
- The sentence "Neglect higher order aggregation..." is good (avoiding ambiguity), but consider stating clearly if you want the answer as “total fraction of monomer in dimer” or “fraction of total molecule as dimer molecule count.”
- Units and variables are well defined.
- Overall well-posed—only minor clarification needed.

---

### Question 2

**Strengths:**
- Realistic scenario; non-standard context (Guideline 1, 5).
- Single calculation for trans/cis ratio using thermodynamics (Guideline 3, 6).
- Equation provided, units and constants are clear (Guideline 9).

**Weaknesses/Improvements:**
- Phrasing “ratio of trans to cis isomers at equilibrium” is concise, but consider specifying: “Calculate the equilibrium ratio $[\mathrm{trans}]/[\mathrm{cis}]$...”
- Some redundancy: “Using …,” then “Use the equation…”—can be merged for conciseness (Guideline 7).
- Suggest: "Calculate the equilibrium $[\mathrm{trans}]/[\mathrm{cis}]$ ratio at 310 K using $K = e^{-\Delta G/(RT)}$..."

---

### Question 3

**Strengths:**
- Original assembly application (Guideline 5).
- Multi-step: kinetics to fiber length (Guideline 3).
- Units are clear, and initial conditions specified (Guideline 9).

**Weaknesses/Improvements:**
- Could clarify initial condition: does “initial fibers have negligible length” mean $L_0 = 0$?
- No redundancy observed.

---

### Question 4

**Strengths:**
- Classical Arrhenius application, but with an original photochemical context (Guideline 1, 5).
- Multi-step: calculate fold change in $k$ from difference in $E_a$ (Guideline 3).
- Units and variables clear (Guideline 9).

**Weaknesses/Improvements:**
- “Fold increase in rate constant $k$ induced by irradiation” is clear, but could specify: “Calculate the fold increase $k_{irr}/k_{dark}$” for clarity.
- Good otherwise.

---

### Question 5

**Strengths:**
- Models a relevant host–guest chemistry scenario in a biological compartment (Guideline 1, 5).
- Multi-step: equilibrium, volume, Avogadro's number, discrete complex count (Guideline 3).
- Most units defined (Guideline 9).

**Weaknesses/Improvements:**
- The amount “$10^{-7}~\mathrm{mol}$ of host per lysosome” is orders of magnitude too high for a $1.5 \times 10^{-15}~\mathrm{L}$ compartment; this could create physically unrealistic results. Double-check concentrations to ensure a realistic scenario (Guideline 1).
- “Negligible depletion of free guest” is fine to state, but could be made concise: “Assume $[G]$ remains constant.”
- When asking for “integer number of complexes,” specify to round down to nearest integer if result is not already integral.

---

### Question 6

**Strengths:**
- Real photophysical parameter setup (Guideline 1, 5).
- Multi-step: photon flux, molecule count, fraction absorbed, quantum yield (Guideline 3).
- Units consistent (Guideline 9).

**Weaknesses/Improvements:**
- State more explicitly whether every incident photon passes through 1 cm pathlength in the intracellular volume—could clarify “Assume effective absorption pathlength is 1 cm.”
- The phrase "photoconversion rate" could be clearer as "moles of molecules photoconverted per second."
- Variable definitions are adequate but could be more succinct: e.g. "Calculate the photoconversion rate in mol s$^{-1}$ (give 3 sig figs).”

---

### Question 7

**Strengths:**
- Well-posed kinetic photodissociation scenario (Guideline 1, 5).
- Single-step exponential decay, units specified (Guideline 2, 9, 11).
- Requires multi-step reasoning (Guideline 3).

**Weaknesses/Improvements:**
- Explicitly label that $k$ is a first-order rate constant in phrasing (though shown by units).

---

### Question 8

**Strengths:**
- Models photochemical modulation of CAC, original (Guideline 1, 5).
- Multi-step: factor reduction, correct units (Guideline 3, 9).

**Weaknesses/Improvements:**
- Explicitly specify that “two significant figures” refers to numerical answer, not to “two significant digits past the decimal.”
- Problem is very direct (one-step): could be strengthened by requiring calculation of an actual aggregation number or similar second step.

---

### Question 9

**Strengths:**
- FRET activation threshold in a cellular assembly—original, contextual (Guideline 1, 5).
- Requires division and rounding (Guideline 3, 6, 11).
- Correctly requests an integer value.

**Weaknesses/Improvements:**
- Clarify “minimal”: does it include rounding up (ceil)? State “round up to the nearest integer” since partial fluorophores cannot exist.
- Instead of "cube of volume", specify "occupies a cube with volume..." for clarity.

---

### Question 10

**Strengths:**
- Relevant to photoactivated assemblies; kinetic model (Guideline 1, 5).
- Multi-step: rate expression, steady-state, unit conversion (Guideline 3).
- Phrasing is concise and expects a properly rounded final value (Guideline 6, 7, 11).

**Weaknesses/Improvements:**
- "Assuming $[P]$ remains approximately constant" is good, but you might say, "Assume $[P]$ does not change throughout irradiation."
- Specify the steady-state concentration symbol in the answer: “Give $[A]_\mathrm{ss}$…”

---

## General and Overarching Feedback

- **All questions** are original and non-standard, which is excellent.
- All but one question clearly feature a single answer and avoid multipart answers (Guideline 10).  
- Clarity of what is being solved for can be improved in a few places (see comments above).
- A few units/amounts in biological scenarios (e.g., host amount in Q5) are possibly unrealistic—check all biological concentrations/amounts for reasonability.
- All variables should be defined upon first use.
- Where “minimal number” or “integer value” is expected, specify “round up” or “round down” as appropriate for clarity and to avoid ambiguity (Guideline 6).
- Where a numerical answer is required, always indicate desired significant digits and units (most questions do this well).

=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
**Overall feedback:**  
These questions strongly model advanced photochemistry and supramolecular chemistry scenarios, integrating biologically relevant contexts and requiring multi-step calculations. They are largely original, rigorous, and concise. Most define chemical and physical constants, use correct units, and avoid textbook cliche problems. Answers are uniquely determined. Below is question-specific and general feedback organized by guideline:

---

**1. Model a Chemistry Scenario**  
All questions start from advanced, relevant scenarios involving supramolecular assemblies or photochemistry in biological environments. No improvements needed.

**2. Expect answers as numerical values with appropriate units or IUPAC nomenclature**  
Most questions explicitly ask for a numerical value and specify units or decimal places. No issues found here.

**3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning**  
Each question clearly requires more than a direct plug-in; calculation or conceptual steps are needed. Good implementation.

**4. Avoid Redundancy**  
No obvious redundancy in information provided. All data in stem is relevant to the required solution.

**5. Be Unique**  
Scenarios are not generic textbook cases, and show originality throughout.

**6. Single Solution**  
Each question requests a single value or name. Be careful in Q1 that the equilibrium could have two mathematically possible roots (from a quadratic) — but physical context ensures only one is sensible. Consider explicitly noting this in instruction if ambiguity is possible.

**7. Rigorous, Concise Phrasing**  
Generally excellent. Minor note: sometimes the stem is a bit longer than necessary due to context, but not to a degree that invites confusion.

**8. Avoid Colloquial/Ambiguous Terminology**  
All phrasing is formal and unambiguous.

**9. Units & Nomenclature**  
Units are almost always consistent and given explicitly. Chemical identity is embedded in context, so IUPAC naming is not needed for answer.

**10. Questions must not have multiple parts**  
No split/compound questions detected — each has a single final numerical answer.

**11. Solution Formatting: LaTeX and Markdown**  
Your formatting was correct in the equations and variables presented in the question stems.

### Question-by-Question Actionable Feedback

#### Q1 (Photoactivatable compound, dimer fraction)
- **Positive:** Advanced, directs to a single equilibrium fraction.
- **Action:**  
    - Instruct that only one physical root is possible for the quadratic solution (if applicable) to reinforce uniqueness.
    - Could further clarify that "neglect higher order aggregation" includes trimer and above.

#### Q2 (Azobenzene, trans/cis ratio)
- **Positive:** Clear, concise, and requires thermodynamic reasoning.
- **Action:** None needed.

#### Q3 (Fiber elongation, average fiber length)
- **Positive:** Focused, specified answer format.
- **Action:** Confirm that units for $k_{elong}$ and $[M]$ are compatible for nm/s growth; clarify if $k_{elong}$ is for nm per M per s. If not, instruct to provide variables' units to ensure dimensional consistency.

#### Q4 (Arrhenius, photochemical rate increase)
- **Positive:** Calculation and physical chemistry deep reasoning.
- **Action:** None needed.

#### Q5 (Cyclodextrin, host–guest number)
- **Positive:** Biologically relevant, asks for number of complexes.
- **Action:**  
    - Clarify that "negligible depletion" means $[G]$ does not decrease appreciably, for clarity.
    - Could specify units for $K_b$ (already done), but might state explicitly that $[H]$ and $[HG]$ are per lysosome.

#### Q6 (Photoconversion rate, quantum yield)
- **Positive:** Multi-parameter calculation consistent with advanced photochemistry.
- **Action:**  
    - Check pathlength: 1 cm is extremely long compared to a cell ($1 \,\mu$m scale). Specify pathlength or clarify if this is a technical artifact (e.g. effective pathlength). If realistic error, consider reducing it.

#### Q7 (First-order photodissociation, concentration after 1 hr)
- **Positive:** Single-step but with exponential decay, requires correct units.
- **Action:** None needed.

#### Q8 (Amphiphilic CAC, isomerization effect)
- **Positive:** Straightforward, unique answer. Requires application of factor change.
- **Action:** None needed.

#### Q9 (FRET, cubic micron occupancy, minimum number)
- **Positive:** Biophysical, requires calculation and appropriate rounding.
- **Action:** State more clearly that the answer should be "rounded up to the next integer," to avoid ambiguity over rounding conventions.

#### Q10 (Photoswitchable assembly, rate equation, steady-state)
- **Positive:** Applied kinetic reasoning, unique answer.
- **Action:** None needed.

---

**General Suggestions for Future Improvements:**
- Review kinetic/thermodynamic constants for dimensional consistency.
- If using cell/organellar scales (Q6, Q5), double-check that stated pathlengths, volumes, or mole counts are realistic and physiologically plausible.
- For equilibrium/kinetic quadratic problems (Q1), include a prompt to "select the physically meaningful root."
- Where volume or number units are small (single organelles, subcellular volumes), always check for realistic molecule numbers (should not get below 1).
- Always explicitly state rounding/decimal conventions at the end of questions if the instruction is critical to an unambiguous answer.
- If using advanced or non-standard parameters (e.g., effective absorption pathlength), provide a brief parenthetical note or assumption.

**Summary:**  
Your questions are complex, original, and require multi-step reasoning; they nearly all meet the rigorous criteria set forth. Only minor clarifications on decimal rounding and pathlength realism are suggested. Excellent work!

=== Turn 2: Critic feedback ===
Certainly! Here is a **concise, actionable critique** of your questions using your stated guidelines.  
---

### General Feedback (applies throughout)

- **Clarity & Structure**: Overall, the questions are clearly structured and mathematically precise, using appropriate LaTeX formatting.
- **Numerical/Unique Solution**: Each question leads to a single, unambiguous quantitative answer.
- **Chemistry Modeling**: Each problem models a complex chemical/photochemical scenario tailored for an advanced context—well done.
- **Units & Nomenclature**: Units are consistent, and the chemical terminology is precise (no violations of IUPAC rules).
- **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Every question requires multi-step logical or mathematical reasoning.
- **Originality**: Scenarios are sophisticated and not textbook derivatives.

---

### Individual Question Feedback

#### Question 1
- **Strengths**: Realistic assembly problem; unique, multi-step calculation; only one answer.
- **Improvement**: State explicitly that monomer concentration refers to *total* monomeric units (including those in the dimer), if that’s intended—ambiguous "total monomeric units present as dimer".
- **Conciseness**: Reframe "only one physically meaningful solution" more assertively, e.g., "Provide a positive, real solution only."

#### Question 2
- **Strengths**: Ideal for equilibrium ratio; thermodynamics focus is clear.
- **Improvement**: The equation for $K$ is written in terms of $[\mathrm{trans}]/[\mathrm{cis}]$, but $K$ is typically $[\mathrm{cis}]/[\mathrm{trans}]$. To avoid confusion, clarify which ratio you want, and perhaps restate the equation as solved for the answer expected.

#### Question 3
- **Strengths**: Multi-step reasoning (integration); realistic growth kinetics.
- **Improvement**: "Product yields nm/s" is helpful but can be unnecessary—consider directly stating the expansion to encourage dimensional analysis. Specify whether $[M]$ is constant over the time period.

#### Question 4
- **Strengths**: Unique, mechanistic, and concise application of Arrhenius.
- **Improvement**: None needed—the question is clear, rigorous, and meets all criteria.

#### Question 5
- **Strengths**: Multi-step, realistic, original, single result.
- **Improvement**: The phrase "Assume negligible depletion of free guest concentration" could be streamlined—just state "$[G]$ remains constant."  
  - Specify "rounded down to the nearest integer" for clarity.

#### Question 6
- **Strengths**: Complex, authentic photochemistry scenario.
- **Improvement**: The "effective absorption pathlength of 1 cm (typical for cuvette measurements)" is not typical for intracellular contexts—state more assertively that this is an artificial constraint for calculation, not just a "simplification." Remove parenthetical apologies that suggest uncertainty.
- **Numbers**: Specify that the calculated value is for the "rate of photoconversion inside the illuminated volume."

#### Question 7
- **Strengths**: Concise, one-step with decay kinetics.
- **Improvement**: None—problem is well-crafted.

#### Question 8
- **Strengths**: Short, clear, unambiguous CAC decrease.
- **Improvement**: Clarify "Express your answer in molarity" as "Give your answer in M" to ensure students do not provide other units.

#### Question 9
- **Strengths**: Unique, interesting application.
- **Improvement**: State "rounded up" using standard terminology: "Round up to the nearest integer", instead of "rounded up".

#### Question 10
- **Strengths**: Unique, steady-state kinetics, one answer.
- **Improvement**: "Assuming $[P]$ remains constant during irradiation": best to state "Assume $[P] = [P]_0$ is constant" for clarity.
- **Rounding**: Use "Round your answer to two significant figures."

### **Summary Table**

| Q# | Issue(s) for Improvement | How to Fix |
|----|--------------------------|------------|
| 1 | Monomer concentration meaning; "physically meaningful" phrasing | Specify if total/initial/free monomer; reword solution type |
| 2 | Equilibrium ratio $K$ direction/definition | Define $K$ as per desired output |
| 3 | Kinetic variable constancy; units clarification | Specify $[M]$ constancy, encourage dimensional analysis |
| 4 | - | Well-constructed |
| 5 | Rounding/phrasing for guest [G]; instruction wording | Rephrase "negligible depletion"; clarify rounding |
| 6 | Absorption pathlength rationale | Directly state, don't hedge; focus the scope of answer |
| 7 | - | Well-constructed |
| 8 | Units request | Rephrase to "Give your answer in M" |
| 9 | Rounding instruction | Use "Round up to the nearest integer" |
| 10 | Clarity on $[P]$ constancy, answer rounding | Specify $[P]$ fixed; clarify rounding |

### **Actionable Summary**

- **Define all variables and solution types unambiguously.**
- **Avoid hedging (e.g., "as an experimental simplification"), state calculation parameters as explicit givens.**
- **State rounding instructions and units in standardized form.**
- **Phrase chemical and kinetic scenarios with explicit context when approximations or constancies are assumed.**
- **Watch for ambiguous terminology in solution instructions ("meaningful" or "rounded down" vs. "floor"/"ceil"/"round to ... sig. figs.").**
- **Double-check mathematical definitions (equilibrium constant ratios) to match the asked-for quantity.**
