Below is a critique for each question against your guidelines, plus actionable suggestions for improvement.

---

### Q1
**Strengths:**  
- Clearly presented chemistry scenario (LAMP, molecular weight, DNA mass, concentration calculation).
- Requires multi-step calculation, with units required (nM).

**Weaknesses:**  
- Slightly wordy: "assuming the average molecular weight..." could be omitted.
- Units must be checked for consistency (e.g., make sure µL and nM conversions will not trip up the student).
- “Target molecules”—use the precise term: "single-stranded DNA molecules".
- Could emphasize that the answer is a single value.

**Suggestions:**  
- Remove unnecessary phrases for conciseness.
- Specify that the answer is to be given as a single number, in nM, with proper significant figures.
- Example revision:  
  > "A LAMP reaction targets a 200-nucleotide single-stranded DNA region of SARS-CoV-2. If $1~\mu\text{g}$ of target DNA (average nucleotide residue mass $330~\mathrm{g \cdot mol^{-1}}$) is present in $10~\mu\text{L}$, calculate the molar concentration of DNA molecules in nM. Give your answer as a single value."

---

### Q2
**Strengths:**  
- Real-world scenario about assay sensitivity, requires stepwise calculation.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Phrases like "enabling detection from fewer target molecules" add fluff.
- The second sentence uses "minimum number", but this could be restated for formulaic clarity.
- Redundant to explain "each RNA corresponds to one molecule" after mentioning "copies".

**Suggestions:**  
- Delete unneeded background.  
- Collapse question into the essential:  
  > "Conventional LAMP detects a minimum of $5000$ viral RNA copies per $25~\mu\text{L}$ reaction. If Penn-RAMP increases sensitivity $50$-fold, calculate the minimum number of detectable RNA copies per reaction. Provide a numerical answer."

---

### Q3
**Strengths:**  
- Focuses on thermodynamic/kinetic principles in isothermal chemistry.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Asks for two steps (calculate $\Delta G^\ddagger$ at $65^\circ$C and the rate ratio at two temperatures)—violates single-solution requirement (#10).

**Suggestions:**  
- Choose one: either ask for $\Delta G^\ddagger$ at $65^\circ$C **or** for the rate ratio between two temperatures (but not both).
- Example rewrite:  
  > "At $65^\circ$C, the rate-determining step of an isothermal amplification assay has $\Delta H^\ddagger = 80~\mathrm{kJ \cdot mol^{-1}}$ and $\Delta S^\ddagger = -50~\mathrm{J \cdot mol^{-1} \cdot K^{-1}}$. Calculate the activation Gibbs free energy, $\Delta G^\ddagger$, in $\mathrm{kJ \cdot mol^{-1}}$ at $65^\circ$C. Give a single value."

---

### Q4
**Strengths:**  
- Combines biochemistry with IUPAC nomenclature, requiring both counting and systematic naming.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Explicitly asks for two answers: the number of guanine bases **and** the IUPAC name.
- Sequence and base content are somewhat redundant (you can just count in the sequence).
- Clarity: "assuming each nucleotide is named as a deoxyribonucleoside monophosphate"—ambiguous for readers less familiar with naming conventions.

**Suggestions:**  
- Choose one: either base count **or** full IUPAC name, not both.
- Clarify that the nucleotides are $5'$-monophosphates, and request the IUPAC name for the given sequence only.
- Example revision:  
  > "Given the 15-nucleotide sequence 5'-GGATGCGGATCGTGG-3', provide its full IUPAC name, naming each nucleotide as a $5'$-deoxyribonucleoside monophosphate. Give the complete compound name."

---

### Q5
**Strengths:**  
- Application of pH, buffering, and stoichiometry; requires calculation with explicit units.

**Weaknesses:**  
- "To induce this pH change" is unnecessary.
- Explicitly state that answer should be a single value, with units.

**Suggestions:**  
- Trim for conciseness and clarity.
- Example revision:  
  > "A reaction mixture ($50~\mu\text{L}$, buffering capacity $0.02~\mathrm{mol \cdot L^{-1} \cdot pH^{-1}}$) undergoes a pH shift from $7.4$ to $6.2$. Calculate the amount, in moles, of $\mathrm{H^+}$ released."

---

### Q6
**Strengths:**  
- Exponential growth, aligns with LAMP and amplification calculations.

**Weaknesses:**  
- "Amplification cycles" in LAMP are nonstandard, but given "per 30 seconds" it is ok.
- The formula could just say $N = N_0 (1 + e)^n$, with $e$ defined carefully.
- Ask for a single value in scientific notation.

**Suggestions:**  
- Condense for clarity—don't restate formula unless necessary.
- Example rewrite:  
  > "In a LAMP reaction, each 30-second cycle has an efficiency of $90\%$ at $65^\circ$C. Starting from $100$ RNA copies, calculate the number of copies after $15$ minutes, using $N = N_0 (1+0.9)^n$. Give a single numerical answer."

---

### Q7
**Strengths:**  
- Simple mole calculation based on concentration and volume.

**Weaknesses:**  
- "Number of antibody molecules" is clear, but specify answer format.
- Volume in $\mu$L and concentration in $\mu$M—check for convenient unit compatibility.

**Suggestions:**  
- Specify that the answer should be given as a single value (no intermediate steps needed).
- Example revision:  
  > "A $100~\mu\text{L}$ solution contains antibodies at $5~\mu\text{M}$. Using Avogadro’s number ($6.022 \times 10^{23}~\mathrm{mol^{-1}}$), calculate the total number of antibody molecules in the solution."

---

### Q8
**Strengths:**  
- Melting temperature and Wallace rule, relevant to experimental design.

**Weaknesses:**  
- "Estimate the minimum number..." is clear, but "primer template" is ambiguous—should it refer to "the 20-nt primer" instead of the full 180-nt template?
- Ensure all numbers used are strictly needed—e.g., the 180-bp region is irrelevant when asking about the 20-mer.

**Suggestions:**  
- Focus on the primer sequence only.
- Example revision:  
  > "A 20-nucleotide LAMP primer has a melting temperature $T_m = 68^\circ\mathrm{C}$ by the Wallace rule: $T_m = 2(A+T) + 4(G+C)$. Estimate the minimum combined number of guanine and cytosine residues in the primer."


---

### Q9
**Strengths:**  
- Kinetics question—turnover number and time to synthesize a biopolymer.

**Weaknesses:**  
- "Minimum time"—is this about intrinsic enzyme kinetics? Make it clear: "Assume processive action with no pauses."
- Specify answer in seconds.

**Suggestions:**  
- Slight phrasing refinement for clarity, answer format.
- Example revision:  
  > "A reverse transcriptase synthesizes cDNA at a rate of $50$ nucleotides per second. Calculate the minimum time, in seconds, to generate a $10{,}000$-base cDNA from a single RNA template. Give a numerical value."

---

### Q10
**Strengths:**  
- Amplification calculation—original but direct.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Be very explicit about the format of the answer (moles/L).
- “Amplicons” is sometimes ambiguously used—just clarify that it's the final copy number divided by volume.

**Suggestions:**  
- Make sure all terms are unambiguous.
- Example rewrite:  
  > "A $20~\mu\text{L}$ Penn-RAMP reaction initially contains $2 \times 10^5$ nucleic acid template molecules. After amplification, copy number increases by $10^7$-fold. Calculate the final amplicon concentration in $\mathrm{mol \cdot L^{-1}}$."

---

### General Feedback

- **Be rigorous and concise;** strip out background unless it directly impacts the calculation.
- **One calculation per question:** if you use multi-part problems, split them into separate questions.
- **Units and nomenclature:** Always specify expected units and IUPAC standards.
- **Equation formatting:** Use $...$ for all inline equations and keep the question Markdown-friendly.
- **Originality:** All questions above are acceptably original for advanced undergrad/grad biochemistry or analytical chemistry, but avoid generic buffer or molarity problems unless placed in an authentic testing/research context.
- **No textbook duplication:** You’ve succeeded here; the questions are not standard textbook fare.

---

**In summary:**  
- Remove all extraneous phrasing/background.
- Each question should isolate a single unique, original multi-step calculation or chemically precise nomenclature assignment.
- Provide clear expected answer format (units, IUPAC names, etc).
- Write MarkDown/LaTeX equations consistently.
- For two-step or compound-answer questions, split into two, or reduce to one.

**Most other aspects (conciseness, multi-step reasoning, unique scenarios, single solution, LaTeX formatting, etc.) are excellent.**  
*Just a few tweaks on answer format clarity and chemical nomenclature precision would make these questions exemplary for advanced chemistry assessment.*
