### Question 1

> In the palladium-catalyzed Buchwald–Hartwig amination of 2-bromotoluene with morpholine, a side reaction leads to an undesired cyclized dibenzodiazepinone formed via intramolecular CO insertion using a CO surrogate at 120 °C. Given that the rate constants for amination and cyclization are $1.2 \times 10^{-3}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $3.6 \times 10^{-4}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ respectively, calculate the regioselectivity ratio (amination : cyclization) at steady state assuming first-order kinetics for both pathways. Express your answer as a dimensionless number rounded to two significant figures.

**Strengths:**  
- Clear scenario, no extraneous info.  
- Directly asks for a numerical, dimensionless answer.  
- Multistep: must consider rates and kinetics logic.

**Improvement:**  
- The term "regioselectivity" is slightly misapplied—regioselectivity describes preferential formation at different positions on the same molecule. Here, the products are different (amination vs. cyclized), so "product ratio" or "selectivity ratio" may be more appropriate and avoid ambiguity.
- Steady-state is unnecessary here; for parallel first-order reactions, the product ratio is simply the ratio of rate constants.

**Actionable revision:**  
- Rephrase as "Calculate the product selectivity ratio (amination : cyclization)...".

### Question 2

> During the metal-catalyzed cyclization to synthesize a dibenzodiazepinone derivative, a key step involves CO insertion from a CO surrogate releasing 0.75 mol of CO per mole of surrogate decomposed. If 0.50 g of the surrogate (molar mass 64 g·mol⁻¹) is employed in a sealed 1.0 L reactor at 298 K, calculate the partial pressure of CO generated in atmospheres, assuming ideal gas behavior. Use $R = 0.08206$ L·atm·K⁻¹·mol⁻¹.

**Strengths:**  
- Realistic and precise scenario.
- Numerical answer with units required.
- Multistep: must do stoichiometry and gas law.

**Improvement:**  
- All units match, concise. Good chemical nomenclature.
- Could clarify that 100% conversion of surrogate to CO is assumed.

**Actionable revision:**  
- Add: "...assuming complete decomposition of the surrogate."  
- Alternatively, state "...if all the surrogate decomposes as described."

---

### Question 3

> A Buchwald–Hartwig amination using 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene and aniline proceeds under 5 mol% Pd catalyst, producing para- and ortho-substituted products. If the para-substituted product has a transition state free energy of activation $\Delta G^\ddagger = 85.4$ kJ·mol⁻¹ and the ortho-substituted has $\Delta G^\ddagger = 89.2$ kJ·mol⁻¹ at 298 K, calculate the expected para:ortho product ratio assuming equal pre-exponential factors. Use $R = 8.314$ J·mol⁻¹·K⁻¹.

**Strengths:**  
- Non-trivial example.
- IUPAC nomenclature.
- Numerical answer as a ratio.

**Improvement:**  
- The mention of "producing para- and ortho-substituted products" is slightly ambiguous; specify "para- and ortho-aniline derivatives" for clarity.
- "Assuming equal pre-exponential factors" is correct and explicit.

**Actionable revision:**  
- Replace "producing para- and ortho-substituted products" with "...producing para- and ortho-anilino substituted derivatives".

### Question 4

> In the synthesis of clozapine, the key C–N bond formation proceeds via Buchwald–Hartwig amination with an apparent rate constant of $2.5 \times 10^{-4}$ s⁻¹ at 100 °C. Using the Arrhenius equation and assuming an activation energy of 82 kJ·mol⁻¹, estimate the apparent rate constant at 80 °C. Use $R = 8.314$ J·mol⁻¹·K⁻¹ and express your answer in s⁻¹ rounded to two significant figures.

**Strengths:**  
- Advanced and relevant (medicinal chemistry angle).
- Requires use of the Arrhenius equation.
- Explicit about final units and rounding.

**Improvement:**  
- 'Apparent rate constant' is acceptable, but clarify that it's under otherwise identical conditions.
- Be explicit that the rate constant to be estimated is for the same reaction at a different temperature.

**Actionable revision:**  
- Add "...for the same reaction under identical conditions except temperature." if you want maximum clarity.

---

### Question 5

> A novel CO surrogate decomposes to generate CO in a Pd-catalyzed cyclization forming dibenzodiazepinone. Stoichiometric analysis reveals 1.5 equivalents of CO per mole of substrate is required for complete conversion. If 0.25 mol of the substrate is used, calculate the minimum mass of surrogate needed (molar mass 90 g·mol⁻¹) to supply sufficient CO for a 95% yield, assuming 100% surrogate efficiency.

**Strengths:**  
- Multistep (stoichiometry, molar mass).
- Unique scenario, not a textbook example.
- Clear numerical input, explicit units.

**Improvement:**  
- The phrase "to supply sufficient CO for a 95% yield" implies the surrogate must provide exactly enough CO for 95% of full conversion, but this could be misinterpreted.
    - Do you mean that only 95% of substrate is expected to convert, so calculate for 0.25 × 0.95 mol substrate?
    - Or, does '95% yield' refer to surrogate efficiency? It's currently clear but easily interpretable in two ways.

**Actionable revision:**  
- Rephrase: "...calculate the minimum mass of surrogate needed to supply enough CO for conversion of 95% of the substrate (assuming 100% surrogate efficiency)."

## **Summary of Actionable Recommendations**

1. **Clarify ambiguous or imprecise terminology** — e.g., 'regioselectivity ratio' vs. 'product selectivity ratio'.
2. **Explicitly state assumptions** — e.g., complete surrogate decomposition, identical conditions except temperature, what is meant by 'yield'.
3. **Minor phrasing tweaks** — Use precise descriptors (e.g., specify 'para-anilino derivative', 'for conversion of 95% of substrate').
4. **All questions satisfy numerical/unit-answer, uniqueness, multistep reasoning, and IUPAC language criteria.**

**After these minor revisions, your questions will fully align with all listed guidelines.**

=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here is a concise critique of your chemistry questions against each guideline, with suggestions for improvement:

---

### Question 1

**Strengths:**  
- Realistic scenario (Buchwald–Hartwig amination and side reaction).
- Requires numerical answer and multi-step reasoning (rate constants and selectivity).
- Concise phrasing, no extraneous info, units consistent, one solution.

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- The wording about the "CO surrogate at 120 °C" is not strictly necessary for the mathematical calculation; only the competing pathways matter.
- The context about “undesired cyclized dibenzodiazepinone” could be shortened for clarity—focus should be on numerical selectivity.

**Actionable Fix:**  
- *Reword sample:*  
  > In a Buchwald–Hartwig amination of 2-bromotoluene with morpholine, two first-order pathways compete: amination ($k_1 = 1.2 \times 10^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$) and cyclization via intramolecular CO insertion ($k_2 = 3.6 \times 10^{-4}$ s$^{-1}$). Calculate the selectivity ratio (amination:cyclization) as a dimensionless number to two significant figures.

---

### Question 2

**Strengths:**  
- Models realistic Pd-catalyzed process, original context.
- Numeric answer requiring stoichiometric and gas law reasoning.
- Concise phrasing, no superfluous information, consistent units, one answer.

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- “During the metal-catalyzed cyclization…”—the catalyst context is background; the actual calculation only concerns the gas generated.
- "If 0.50 g of the surrogate..." could start as "Given 0.50 g [...]".

**Actionable Fix:**  
- *Reword sample:*  
  > A CO surrogate (molar mass 64 g·mol$^{-1}$) decomposes to release 0.75 mol CO per mole used. If 0.50 g decomposes in a sealed 1.0 L reactor at 298 K, calculate the CO partial pressure in atm. Assume ideal gas behavior.

---

### Question 3

**Strengths:**  
- Realistic (selectivity, activation free energies, transition state theory).
- Unique substrate/product permutation.
- Correct units and single numeric answer.

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- “producing para- and ortho-anilino substituted derivatives” is a bit wordy; clarify position and IUPAC nomenclature.
- “para:ortho product ratio” should clarify order (e.g., “ratio of para- to ortho-”).

**Actionable Fix:**  
- *Reword sample:*  
  > In a Buchwald–Hartwig amination of 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene with aniline, the para- and ortho-anilino products have activation free energies of 85.4 kJ·mol$^{-1}$ and 89.2 kJ·mol$^{-1}$, respectively, at 298 K. Assuming equal pre-exponential factors, calculate the expected para:ortho product ratio, rounded to two significant figures. Use $R = 8.314$ J·mol$^{-1}$·K$^{-1}$.

---

### Question 4

**Strengths:**  
- Uses Arrhenius analysis; multi-step calculation.
- Realistic case, precise numbers, single answer.

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- Clarify that everything except temperature is constant (you mention “identical conditions except temperature,” but be even more concise).
- Specify temperature units on first use (e.g., "at $100\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$ and $80\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$").

**Actionable Fix:**  
- *Reword sample:*  
  > The C–N bond-forming step in clozapine synthesis has an apparent rate constant $k_{100} = 2.5 \times 10^{-4}$ s$^{-1}$ at $100^\circ$C (373 K). If the activation energy is 82 kJ·mol$^{-1}$, estimate the rate constant at $80^\circ$C (353 K) under identical conditions. Express your answer in s$^{-1}$, rounded to two significant figures.

---

### Question 5

**Strengths:**  
- Unique scenario (CO stoichiometry, conversion percentage).
- Rigorous, single numerical answer.

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- Could explicitly state “minimum mass” (which you did), but clarify that “conversion of 95% of the substrate” means “amount required to achieve at least 95% conversion,” not just “converted amount.”
- Delete “assume 100% surrogate efficiency” (it is implied unless otherwise stated).

**Actionable Fix:**  
- *Reword sample:*  
  > A CO surrogate (molar mass 90 g·mol$^{-1}$) produces 1.0 mol CO per mole upon decomposition. For a reaction needing 1.5 mol CO per mole substrate, what is the minimum mass of surrogate required to convert 95% of 0.25 mol substrate? Give your answer in grams, rounded to one decimal place.

In the Buchwald–Hartwig amination of 2-bromotoluene with morpholine, two independent first-order pathways compete: amination (rate constant \(k_1 = 1.2 \times 10^{-3}\) s\(^{-1}\)) and cyclization via intramolecular CO insertion (rate constant \(k_2 = 3.6 \times 10^{-4}\) s\(^{-1}\)). Assuming both pathways follow first-order kinetics, calculate the ratio of initial rates (\(k_1/k_2\)) expressing the selectivity for amination relative to cyclization. Report your answer as a dimensionless number rounded to two significant figures.

A carbonyl (CO) surrogate, methyl formate (molar mass 64 g·mol\(^{-1}\)), decomposes to release 0.75 mol of CO per mole of surrogate consumed. If 0.50 g of methyl formate decomposes completely in a sealed 1.0 L reactor at 298 K, calculate the resulting CO partial pressure in atm. Assume ideal gas behavior and use \(R = 0.08206\) L·atm·K\(^{-1}\)·mol\(^{-1}\). Report your answer rounded to two significant figures.

In the Buchwald–Hartwig amination of 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene with aniline, the para- and ortho-anilino products have activation free energies (\(\Delta G^\ddagger\)) of 85.4 kJ·mol\(^{-1}\) and 89.2 kJ·mol\(^{-1}\), respectively, at 298 K. Assuming equal pre-exponential factors, calculate the expected ratio of para-anilino to ortho-anilino products based on their kinetic rates. Use \(R = 8.314\) J·mol\(^{-1}\)·K\(^{-1}\) and report your answer rounded to two significant figures.

The C–N bond-forming step in clozapine (IUPAC name: 8-Chloro-11-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-5H-dibenzo[b,e][1,4]diazepine) synthesis has an apparent rate constant \(k_{373} = 2.5 \times 10^{-4}\) s\(^{-1}\) at 373 K (100 °C). Given the activation energy \(E_a = 82\) kJ·mol\(^{-1}\), calculate the expected rate constant at 353 K (80 °C) using the Arrhenius equation. Use \(R = 8.314\) J·mol\(^{-1}\)·K\(^{-1}\) and report your answer in s\(^{-1}\), rounded to two significant figures.
