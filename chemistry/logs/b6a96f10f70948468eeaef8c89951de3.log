Here are five novel Masters-level chemistry questions based on your specifications:

1. <question>Kraft lignin is extracted from black liquor and subsequently analyzed using quantitative $^{31}$P NMR spectroscopy. A $25.0$ mg sample of kraft lignin is derivatized with $100 \mu L$ of a cyclohexanol solution containing $5.00 \times 10^{-5}$ mol of chromium(III) acetylacetonate (Cr(acac)$_3$) as an internal standard. The resulting $^{31}$P NMR spectrum exhibits a signal for aliphatic hydroxyl groups with an integral of $1250$ units and a signal for the Cr(acac)$_3$ with an integral of $875$ units. Calculate the number of moles of aliphatic hydroxyl groups per gram of the original kraft lignin sample. Express your answer in mol/g. </question>

2. <question>Organosolv lignin, obtained via ethanol-water pulping, contains residual carbohydrates that interfere with accurate UV-Vis ionization difference spectroscopy. To quantify phenolic hydroxyl groups, a model compound, guaiacol, is used for calibration. A $1.00 \times 10^{-4}$ M solution of guaiacol in ethanol exhibits an absorbance of $0.520$ at $280$ nm at pH 7.0. Upon addition of NaOH to achieve pH 12.0, the absorbance shifts to $0.850$ at $295$ nm. An organosolv lignin sample, dissolved in ethanol, shows an absorbance increase of $0.250$ at $295$ nm upon alkalization. Assuming a linear relationship between concentration and absorbance change, what is the concentration of phenolic hydroxyl groups (expressed as guaiacol equivalents) in the lignin sample (in M)?</question>

3. <question>A sample of kraft lignin undergoes alkaline hydrolysis to cleave specific ether linkages. A $50.0$ mg sample of lignin is dissolved in $5.00$ mL of a $1.00$ M NaOH solution and heated at $80^\circ$C for 2 hours. After acidification and extraction, the resulting solution is analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC. A phenolic compound, vanillin, is identified and quantified using an external calibration curve. The peak area corresponding to vanillin is $3.75 \times 10^5$ AU. A standard solution of vanillin with a concentration of $10.0$ ppm yields a peak area of $5.00 \times 10^5$ AU under identical HPLC conditions. Calculate the percentage (by weight) of vanillin released from the lignin sample. </question>

4. <question>Organosolv lignin is being considered as a replacement for phenol in phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resins. A $1.50$ g sample of organosolv lignin is reacted with excess formaldehyde in an alkaline environment. The resulting resin is dried, and its mass is found to be $1.95$ g. Assuming that the mass increase is solely due to the incorporation of formaldehyde (CH$_2$O) into the lignin structure, calculate the number of moles of formaldehyde incorporated per gram of the original lignin sample. Provide your answer in mol/g.</question>

5. <question>A kraft lignin sample is fractionated by sequential solvent extraction using dichloromethane (DCM) and then acetone. A $100$ mg sample of the original lignin yields $35$ mg of DCM-soluble fraction and $45$ mg of acetone-soluble fraction. The remaining insoluble residue is $20$ mg. Each fraction and the original lignin are subjected to elemental analysis. The oxygen content of the original lignin is $30.0 \%$ by weight. The oxygen content of the DCM-soluble fraction is $15.0 \%$ by weight, and the oxygen content of the acetone-soluble fraction is $35.0 \%$ by weight. Calculate the oxygen content (as a percentage by weight) of the insoluble residue. </question>

*   **2. Expect Numerical Values:** Excellent. It asks for a numerical value in mol/g.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Good. It requires calculating moles of IS, using integral ratio, and then dividing by sample mass.
*   **4. Avoid Redundancy:** Good. All information is necessary for the calculation or provides relevant context.
*   **5. Be Unique/Complexity:** Good. While quantitative NMR is standard, its application to lignin derivatization with an internal standard is appropriate for a Masters level.

*   **7. Rigorous, Concise Phrasing:** Good. The phrasing "derivatized with $100 \mu L$ of a cyclohexanol solution containing $5.00 \times 10^{-5}$ mol of chromium(III) acetylacetonate" is slightly clunky. It implies that the total moles of internal standard added is $5.00 \times 10^{-5}$ mol, making the $100 \mu L$ volume somewhat irrelevant unless the concentration was given and the total moles needed to be calculated. However, it's interpretable.
*   **8. Avoid Colloquial/Ambiguous:** Good. "Integral units" is standard practice in NMR.
*   **9. Units Consistent/IUPAC:** Excellent.
*   **10. Single Part Answer:** Excellent.
*   **11. LaTeX Formatting:** **Major Failure.** No LaTeX formatting was used for numbers, variables, or units.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1.  **Refine Phrasing (Guideline 7):** Consider rephrasing the internal standard addition for clarity. For example: "A $25.0$ mg sample of kraft lignin is derivatized, with $5.00 \times 10^{-5}$ mol of chromium(III) acetylacetonate (Cr(acac)$_3$) added as an internal standard." The volume of the solvent used for derivatization is generally not needed if the absolute moles of internal standard are provided.
2.  **Implement LaTeX Formatting (Guideline 11):** Enclose all numerical values, variables, units, and chemical formulas (where appropriate, e.g., Cr(acac)$_3$) within `$` for inline math and `$$` for block math if necessary. Example: "A $25.0$ mg sample of kraft lignin is derivatized with $100$ $\mu L$ of a cyclohexanol solution containing $5.00 \times 10^{-5}$ mol of chromium(III) acetylacetonate ($\text{Cr(acac)}_3$) as an internal standard."

*   **5. Be Unique/Complexity:** **Weak.** While the scenario is unique, the core calculation is a very straightforward mass difference and mole conversion. This is generally too simplistic for a Masters-level chemistry problem. A Masters question should ideally involve a more complex chemical principle, e.g., a specific stoichiometric reaction with limiting reagents, or a more involved mass balance if side reactions or byproducts (like water elimination) were hinted at.
*   **6. Single Solution:** Excellent.
*   **7. Rigorous, Concise Phrasing:** Excellent.

    *   **Option A:** Introduce the concept of average degree of substitution and ask for a percentage of reactive sites modified, perhaps requiring an assumed average molecular weight or repeating unit for lignin.
    *   **Option B:** Add a stoichiometric complexity, e.g., if water is eliminated during the reaction, how would that affect the mass balance, or if a specific functional group (e.g., phenolic hydroxyl) reacts, what's the theoretical maximum incorporation?
    *   **Option C:** Provide information about lignin's reactive sites (e.g., number of active positions per average lignin monomer unit) and ask for the *extent* of reaction or the *average number* of formaldehyde units per lignin monomer.
2.  **Implement LaTeX Formatting (Guideline 11):** Enclose all numerical values, variables, units, and chemical formulas ($\text{CH}_2\text{O}$) within `$` for inline math.

*   **5. Be Unique/Complexity:** Good. A mass balance problem on complex mixtures like lignin fractions, involving elemental composition, is well-suited for a Masters level.
*   **6. Single Solution:** Excellent.
*   **7. Rigorous, Concise Phrasing:** Excellent.
*   **8. Avoid Colloquial/Ambiguous:** Excellent. DCM is a standard abbreviation.

**Question 2 Critique:**

*   **1. Model Chemistry Scenario:** Excellent. This accurately represents a real analytical method for lignin characterization.
*   **2. Expect answers as numerical values with appropriate units or chemical compounds named using official IUPAC nomenclature:** Excellent. Expects a numerical value in $\text{M}$.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Intended to, but flawed.
*   **4. Avoid Redundancy:** **Needs Improvement.** The absorbance of guaiacol at $280$ nm at pH $7.0$ ($0.520$) is redundant because the calculation of concentration for phenolic hydroxyl groups using *ionization difference spectroscopy* relies on the *change* in absorbance at the *peak of the ionized form* (here, $295$ nm).
*   **5. Be Unique:** Excellent. The scenario is unique to lignin characterization.
*   **6. Single solution:** **Needs Improvement.** The question is currently unsolvable as presented due to missing information. To calculate the absorbance change ($\Delta A$) for guaiacol, one needs its absorbance at $295$ nm under both acidic/neutral (pH $7.0$) and alkaline (pH $12.0$) conditions. The problem only provides the alkaline absorbance at $295$ nm ($0.850$) and the neutral absorbance at a *different wavelength* ($280$ nm, $0.520$), which is not used for the required $\Delta A$ calculation at $295$ nm.
*   **7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** **Needs Improvement.** The phrasing for the guaiacol calibration is ambiguous regarding how $\Delta A$ should be calculated.
*   **8. Avoid colloquial or ambiguous terminology:** **Needs Improvement.** "absorbance shifts to $0.850$ at $295$ nm" is ambiguous in the context of $\Delta A$ calculation when the initial absorbance at $295$ nm is not provided.
*   **9. Units must be consistent; chemical nomenclature must follow IUPAC rules:** Excellent. Units and nomenclature are consistent.
*   **10. Questions must not have multiple parts to answer, there should be only $1$ solution to each question:** Excellent. It asks for a single quantity.
*   **11. Solution Formatting:** Excellent. All inline math, numbers, and variables are correctly enclosed by `$...$`.

**Actionable Feedback:**
*   **Critical Fix:** Rephrase the guaiacol calibration data to explicitly provide the absorbance at $295$ nm at pH $7.0$, or directly state the absorbance *increase* for the guaiacol solution upon alkalization at $295$ nm.
    *   **Example Fix:** "A $1.00 \times 10^{-4}$ M solution of guaiacol in ethanol shows an absorbance of $0.150$ at $295$ nm at pH $7.0$. Upon addition of $\text{NaOH}$ to achieve pH $12.0$, the absorbance at $295$ nm shifts to $0.850$." (This would yield $\Delta A_{\text{guaiacol}} = 0.850 - 0.150 = 0.700$).
    *   **Simpler Fix:** "A $1.00 \times 10^{-4}$ M solution of guaiacol in ethanol shows an absorbance increase of $0.700$ at $295$ nm upon alkalization."

**Question 3 Critique:**

*   **1. Model Chemistry Scenario:** Excellent. This accurately represents a real analytical method for lignin characterization.
*   **2. Expect answers as numerical values with appropriate units or chemical compounds named using official IUPAC nomenclature:** Excellent. Expects a numerical value in percentage by weight.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Intended to, but flawed.
*   **4. Avoid Redundancy:** **Needs Improvement.** The detailed procedural description ("dissolved in $5.00$ mL of a $1.00$ M $\text{NaOH}$ solution and heated at $80^\circ$C for $2$ hours. After acidification and extraction, the resulting solution is analyzed...") is contextual. While some context is fine for Guideline 1, the critical missing piece of information is the *final volume of the solution that was analyzed by HPLC*. Without this volume, it's impossible to convert the quantified concentration (from HPLC) back to the total mass of vanillin released.
*   **5. Be Unique:** Excellent. Unique application of HPLC to lignin degradation products.
*   **6. Single solution:** **Needs Improvement.** The question is currently unsolvable due to missing information about the volume of the sample solution analyzed by HPLC.
*   **7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** **Needs Improvement.** The phrase "the resulting solution is analyzed" is ambiguous concerning its volume.
*   **8. Avoid colloquial or ambiguous terminology:** **Needs Improvement.** "resulting solution" is ambiguous in terms of volume.
*   **9. Units must be consistent; chemical nomenclature must follow IUPAC rules:** Excellent. Units and nomenclature are consistent.
*   **10. Questions must not have multiple parts to answer, there should be only $1$ solution to each question:** Excellent. It asks for a single quantity.
*   **11. Solution Formatting:** Excellent. All inline math, numbers, and variables are correctly enclosed by `$...$`.

**Actionable Feedback:**
*   **Critical Fix:** Specify the final volume of the solution from which the HPLC analysis was performed.
    *   **Example Fix:** "After acidification and extraction, the resulting solution was quantitatively transferred and made up to a final volume of $5.00$ mL and analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC." (Assuming the initial volume is retained or set as the final analysis volume).

<question>Kraft lignin is extracted from black liquor and subsequently analyzed using quantitative $^{31}$P NMR spectroscopy. A $25.0$ mg sample of kraft lignin is derivatized, with $5.00 \times 10^{-5}$ mol of triphenylphosphine oxide ($\text{TPPO}$) added as an internal standard. The resulting $^{31}$P NMR spectrum exhibits a signal for aliphatic hydroxyl groups with an integral of $1250$ units and a signal for the $\text{TPPO}$ with an integral of $875$ units. Calculate the number of moles of aliphatic hydroxyl groups per gram of the original kraft lignin sample. Express your answer in mol/g.</question>

<question>Organosolv lignin, obtained via ethanol-water pulping, contains residual carbohydrates that interfere with accurate UV-Vis ionization difference spectroscopy. To quantify phenolic hydroxyl groups, a model compound, guaiacol, is used for calibration. A $1.00 \times 10^{-4}$ M solution of guaiacol in ethanol exhibits an absorbance of $0.150$ at $295$ nm at pH $7.0$. Upon addition of $\text{NaOH}$ to achieve pH $12.0$, the absorbance shifts to $0.850$ at $295$ nm. An organosolv lignin sample, dissolved in ethanol, shows an absorbance increase of $0.250$ at $295$ nm upon alkalization. Assuming a linear relationship between concentration and absorbance change, what is the concentration of phenolic hydroxyl groups (expressed as guaiacol equivalents) in the lignin sample (in M)?</question>

<question>A sample of kraft lignin undergoes alkaline hydrolysis to cleave specific ether linkages. A $50.0$ mg sample of lignin is dissolved in $5.00$ mL of a $1.00$ M $\text{NaOH}$ solution and heated at $80^\circ$C for $2$ hours. After acidification and extraction, the resulting solution was quantitatively transferred and made up to a final volume of $5.00$ mL, and analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC. A phenolic compound, vanillin, is identified and quantified using an external calibration curve. The peak area corresponding to vanillin is $3.75 \times 10^5$ AU. A standard solution of vanillin with a concentration of $10.0$ mg/L yields a peak area of $5.00 \times 10^5$ AU under identical HPLC conditions. Calculate the percentage (by weight) of vanillin released from the lignin sample.</question>

<question>Organosolv lignin is being considered as a replacement for phenol in phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resins. A $1.50$ g sample of organosolv lignin, characterized as having an average of $1.5$ reactive sites per repeating monomer unit with an average molecular weight of $200$ g/mol, is reacted with excess formaldehyde in an alkaline environment. The resulting resin is dried, and its mass is found to be $1.95$ g. Assuming that the mass increase is solely due to the incorporation of formaldehyde ($\text{CH}_2\text{O}$) into the lignin structure, calculate the percentage of reactive sites on the lignin that have been modified with formaldehyde.</question>

<question>A kraft lignin sample is fractionated by sequential solvent extraction using dichloromethane ($\text{DCM}$) and then acetone ($\text{acetone}$). A $100$ mg sample of the original lignin yields $35$ mg of $\text{DCM}$-soluble fraction and $45$ mg of $\text{acetone}$-soluble fraction. The remaining insoluble residue is $20$ mg. Each fraction and the original lignin are subjected to elemental analysis. The oxygen content of the original lignin is $30.0 \%$ by weight. The oxygen content of the $\text{DCM}$-soluble fraction is $15.0 \%$ by weight, and the oxygen content of the $\text{acetone}$-soluble fraction is $35.0 \%$ by weight. Calculate the oxygen content (as a percentage by weight) of the insoluble residue.</question>
