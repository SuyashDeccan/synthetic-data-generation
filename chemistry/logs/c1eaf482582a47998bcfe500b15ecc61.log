Certainly! Here is a **concise, actionable critique** of your questions based on the provided guidelines:

---

### Question 1
**Strengths:** 
- Realistic chemistry context; provides all constants and requires explicit calculation.
- Requires multi-step reasoning (conversion from $\Delta G^\circ$ to $K$).
- Consistent units and clear requirement for a numerical value.

**Suggestions:** 
- The setup is strong; ensure you specify the unit for $K$ as "unitless" or "dimensionless equilibrium constant" to avoid unnecessary ambiguity.
- No further improvements needed.

---

### Question 2
**Strengths:** 
- Simple estimation, contextually relevant.
- Proper IUPAC terminology.

**Suggestions:** 
- Stepwise: calculation could be trivial (just $4 \times 10.5$) and might not provide enough challenge or multi-step reasoning (guideline 3). Suggest increasing complexity, perhaps by including partial cooperativity or variable bond strengths, making the student process an additional step.
- Specify the value of "typical bond energy" denoted as $E_{\mathrm{I\cdot\cdot\cdot O}}$ for rigor.

---

### Question 3
**Strengths:** 
- Quantitative, with a unique solution and consistent units.
- Multi-step reasoning (calculation for each cation).
- Clearly written and original context.

**Suggestions:** 
- The term "$E_{\text{mismatch}}$" is not properly defined (is it a percentage? arbitrary units? absolute value?). Specify it is a relative (dimensionless) number for clarity.
- Make explicit that the cavity "diameter" means $r_\mathrm{cavity} = 1.2$ Å when using radii, to avoid ambiguity.
- Directly ask: "Which cation has a smaller $E_{\text{mismatch}}$ and thus greater binding affinity under these assumptions?" to clarify what to report.

---

### Question 6
**Strengths:** 
- Thermodynamic context, consistent units, one answer.

**Suggestions:** 
- The language "ratio of sodium-bound to free macrocycle concentrations" is clear.
- You might clarify if the macrocycle is in excess or if cation is limiting, but as written and given 1 mM macrocycle, it is fine.

**Strengths:** 
- Focuses on relative binding, drives multi-step reasoning.

**Suggestions:** 
- Good as is.

---

### Question 8
**Strengths:** 
- Proper calculation type, all constants provided, multi-step.

**Suggestions:** 
- Context is original and non-standard.

**Minor improvement:** 
- Phrase as "Calculate the wavelength, in nanometres (nm), corresponding to..." for extra clarity.

---

### Question 9
**Strengths:** 
- Requires both enthalpy and entropy consideration, rigorously phrased.

**Suggestions:** 
- Could improve subtlety by requiring explicit calculation (show algebra used).

---

### Question 10
**Strengths:** 
- Involves equilibrium and binding constant, multi-step calculation, consistent units, unique answer.

**Suggestions:** 
- The starting concentrations are realistic.
- For additional rigor, state "Assume $K \gg 1$ and x is the amount complexed" for guided calculation.

---

## **General Summary of Feedback**
- **Most questions are clear, rigorous, and original.**

- **Double-check that answer formats are unit-consistent, and that chemical species use IUPAC names (which you have).**
- **All equations and math are in $...$, which is Markdown correct.**
- **None of the questions require more than a single answer, and extraneous information is minimal.**

**In summary:** Your set is very strong and rigorous, but could be improved by ensuring every question requires at least one step of intermediate reasoning, clarifying variable definitions where relevant, and maximizing context clarity to ensure only one interpretation of each scenario.

- Focuses on single, specific calculation ($K$ from $\Delta G^\circ$).
- Proper, consistent units.

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- The use of both "unitless" and explicit temperature/R values is correct.
- The prompt is clear and concise.
- **No change needed.**

---

### Q2: I···O interaction energy with cooperativity

**Strengths:**  
- Scenario is chemically realistic and unique.
- Requires multi-step reasoning (additivity + cooperativity).
- Specific, numerical answer expected.

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- Phrasing could clarify “simple additivity” (i.e., $E_{\text{add}} = 4 \times E_{\mathrm{I\cdot\cdot\cdot O}}$).
- Consider stating "total stabilization energy = additive value plus 10% of the additive value" for even more explicitness.
- Use of partial cooperativity is original.

---

### Q3: Lennard-Jones mismatch for Li⁺ and Na⁺

**Strengths:**  
- Well-crafted scenario.
- Multi-step calculation, clear focus.
- Units and variable definitions are clear.

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- Dimensionless output requested is appropriate.

**Comment:**  
- Phrasing "thermodynamically favored to bind" may be ambiguous for a Lennard-Jones parameter (which is a simplification). Consider linking more explicitly to binding selectivity.
- **Minor: Consider prompting for the answer as a ratio to make it even more unambiguous.**

---

### Q4: $\Delta G^\circ$ from $K$ calculation

**Strengths:**  
- Clear, concise chemistry problem.
- Standard calculation but uses a realistic binding constant.

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- Similar in conceptual steps to Q1; avoid redundancy by varying question style, e.g., use a different calculation or ask for interpretation.
- Too similar to the standard $K$/$\Delta G^\circ$ textbook calculation.
- **Revise: Combine or replace with a more unique scenario or calculation.**

---

### Q5: Eyring rate calculation with explicit units

- Wording should clarify precise conditions of calculation.

---

### Q7: Fold difference in $K$ from $\Delta\Delta G^\circ$

Here's a thorough critique of your questions, evaluated against your specified guidelines:

---

**General Feedback Across All Questions:**
- **Strengths:**  
  - Every question presents a unique, non-textbook scenario contextualized to phenylalanine-based hypervalent iodine macrocycles—an advanced, original context.
  - Each expects a single quantitative answer with explicit unit requirements.
  - Multi-step calculations are required throughout, and equations are presented using LaTeX/Markdown syntax.
  - Chemical nomenclature is accurate; IUPAC names are either explicit or unambiguous by context.
  - No extraneous, real-world trivia or distractions—questions are concise and focused.
  - Units are mostly consistent; instructions to show all work enforce clarity and rigor.
  - Only a single solution is requested in each question. No multipart queries.

- **Weaknesses/Points for Improvement:**
  - **Explicit Unit Requests:** Some questions do not specify the required units for key intermediate values, which can cause ambiguity (e.g., is $K$ required as unitless or M⁻¹? This should be explicit depending on the context).
  - **Precision:** Sometimes, the request for "show all steps" could be further clarified as "show all numerical steps with units" to avoid any risk that key conversions are glossed over.
  - **Equation Redundancy:** Some questions repeat the equilibrium constant–Gibbs energy relationship ($\Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln K$) several times. While this is natural for different setups, avoid excessive repetition across a set so that the assessment covers broader concepts.
  - **Latexi/Markdown formatting:** All questions use the appropriate Math mode for equations. But in a few places (esp. the last question), some inline vs. block math mode could be tuned for visual clarity.

  - Clarify unit expectations in the ratio—should it be a dimensionless ratio or is a numerical value sufficient?
  - Asking for “all assumptions” could prompt multiple brief statements—better to say “Assume sodium concentration does not change significantly,” and leave it at that.

---

#### Q7: Selectivity from $\Delta\Delta G^\circ$
- **Strengths:**  
  - Focuses on selectivity, a relevant supramolecular concept.
  - Original numerical relationship, single ratio expected.
- **Points for Improvement:**  
  - Specify expected significant figures in $K_\text{Li}/K_\text{Na}$.
  - Consider removing the phrase “show all steps and express your answer clearly” and instead say “Show all calculation steps and provide the final ratio to two significant figures.”

---

#### Q8: Photon Wavelength from Energy
- **Strengths:**  
  - Requires multi-step: conversion from kJ/mol to J/photon, then calculation of wavelength.
  - Explicit instructions to show all steps and appropriately convert units.
- **Points for Improvement:**  
  - Minor formatting: Ensure $E_{\text{photon}}$ placed inside $...$ or $$...$$ is consistent throughout.
  - Specify, e.g., “provide the final $\lambda$ in nanometers, rounded to the nearest integer.”

---

#### Q9: Activation Free Energy Calculation
- **Strengths:**  
  - Requires proper unit conversion (J to kJ) and explicit step-by-step calculation.
- **Points for Improvement:**  
  - For absolute clarity, specify, “Express your answer in kJ·mol⁻¹, to one decimal place.”
  - The intro phrase “Include all necessary unit conversions...” is a bit verbose—could simply say, “Show all steps, including unit conversions.”

---

#### Q10: Complex Formation—Equilibrium Concentration
- **Strengths:**  
  - Real-world relevant with advanced binding equilibrium context.
  - Requires proper setup (x) and solving a quadratic.
- **Points for Improvement:**  
  - “Solve for $x$ numerically or algebraically...” leans toward two solutions—require only a numerical value, perhaps: “Give your final answer for $x$ (in molarity, to two significant digits), and show all calculation steps.”
  - Make explicit whether any approximations (e.g., $K \gg 1$) can be used in simplifying the quadratic—since you stated it, it’s okay.

## **ACTIONABLE SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT**

1. **Clarify Expected Answer Format:**  
   - Clearly state the expected units and significant figures for final answers (e.g., “Express $K$ as a unitless number to two significant figures”).
   - Where a dimensionless ratio is required, state “Express as a unitless ratio, rounded to two decimal places.”

2. **Avoid Even Implied Multiparts:**  
   - For any question that could possible be interpreted as requesting two answers (e.g., Q3), restructure so that a single answer is submitted, e.g., “Provide both the ratio and the favored cation as a single, clear statement.”

3. **Minimize Repetition Across a Set:**  
   - If using similar relationships (e.g., $\Delta G^\circ = -RT\ln K$), briefly note distinctive features between questions, or replace with other types of relationships or kinetic/thermodynamic concepts in part of the set.

4. **Tighten Language on Process:**  
   - Prefer: “Show all calculation steps with units,” over “Show all steps explicitly.”

5. **Formatting (if a single document):**  
   - Consistently use block math ($$...$$) for multiline or key formulae for clarity.
   - For variables and numerical values, always use $...$ for inline equations.

6. **Assumptions:**  
   - Avoid general “state any assumptions” unless this is critical to the learning objective; otherwise, spell out any assumption you wish students to use.

### **Sample Revision for Q3**

**Before:**  
> calculate the relative mismatch energy parameters $E_{\text{mismatch}}$ for Li$^+$ and Na$^+$. Then determine which cation has the smaller mismatch penalty and is thermodynamically favored to bind based on this simplified model. Express your answer as a ratio $E_{\text{mismatch,Na}} / E_{\text{mismatch,Li}}$ and justify your conclusion.

**After Revision:**  
> Calculate the mismatch energy parameters $E_{\text{mismatch}}$ (in arbitrary units) for Li$^+$ and Na$^+$, where $E_{\text{mismatch}} \propto (r_{\text{cation}} - r_{\text{cavity}})^2$. Provide the ratio $E_{\text{mismatch,Na}} / E_{\text{mismatch,Li}}$, rounded to two decimal places, and identify which cation is thermodynamically more favored to bind based on the lower mismatch penalty.

---

**In summary:** Your questions are sophisticated, well-targeted, and generally well-compliant with your guidelines, with only minor improvements needed in answer format specification, avoidance of even implied multiparts, and 100% clarity on expected answers and units.

A phenylalanine-based hypervalent iodine macrocycle (HIM) has a cavity radius of 1.2 Å. Lithium ion (Li$^+$) and sodium ion (Na$^+$) have ionic radii 0.76 Å and 1.02 Å, respectively. Assuming the size-mismatch energy penalty scales with the square of the radius difference,  
$$E_{\mathrm{mismatch}} \propto (r_{\mathrm{cation}} - r_{\mathrm{cavity}})^2,$$  
calculate the ratio   
$$\frac{E_{\mathrm{mismatch,Na}}}{E_{\mathrm{mismatch,Li}}}$$
