<question>  
A planar microcavity contains a molecular ensemble with a Lorentz-bath susceptibility described by  
$$\chi(\omega) = \frac{f \omega_0^2}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 - i \gamma \omega}$$  
with oscillator strength $f=0.1$, resonance frequency $\omega_0 = 2.5 \times 10^{15}\,\text{rad·s}^{-1}$, and damping constant $\gamma = 5 \times 10^{13}\,\text{rad·s}^{-1}$. Using the auxiliary differential equation approach in an FDTD simulation with time step $\Delta t = 1 \times 10^{-18}\,\text{s}$, calculate the discrete-time update term for polarization $P(t+\Delta t)$ assuming $P(t)$ and $P(t-\Delta t)$ are known, expressed as a ratio with respect to $P(t)$. Use a second-order central finite-difference discretization and provide the numerical coefficient (dimensionless, rounded to 4 decimal places) multiplying $P(t)$ in the update formula  
$$P(t+\Delta t) = a \, P(t) + b \, P(t-\Delta t) + c \, E(t),$$  
where $E(t)$ is the electric field amplitude and $a$ corresponds to the specific coefficient asked.</question>

<question>  
In a cavity QED setup, the Rabi splitting $\Omega_R$ between upper and lower polaritons is experimentally measured as $140\,\text{meV}$. The bare molecular excitation lifetime $\tau_0$ is $200\,\text{fs}$. Assume polariton relaxation rates scale as  
$$\Gamma_{UP/LP} = \frac{1}{\tau_0} \left(1 \pm \frac{\Omega_R}{2 \hbar \omega_0}\right)$$  
where $\omega_0 = 3 \times 10^{15}\,\text{rad·s}^{-1}$ is the exciton frequency and $\hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-16}\,\text{eV·s}$. Calculate the upper polariton relaxation time in femtoseconds using this model.</question>

<question>  
A photonic crystal cavity mode couples to $N=10^5$ identical molecules with transition dipole moment $\mu = 10\,\text{D}$ and transition energy $\hbar \omega_0 = 2.0\,\text{eV}$. Given the vacuum permittivity $\varepsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12}\,\text{F·m}^{-1}$ and mode volume $V = 1 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{m}^3$, calculate the collective Rabi splitting energy $\hbar \Omega_R$ (in eV) using the formula  
$$\Omega_R = \sqrt{\frac{N \mu^2 \omega_0}{2 \hbar \varepsilon_0 V}}.$$  
Use $1\,\text{D} = 3.33564 \times 10^{-30}\,C\cdot m$ and provide the result rounded to three significant figures.</question>

<question>  
In a numerical simulation of molecular polaritons, the dark modes are initially uncoupled. Introducing a small disorder potential causes homogeneous broadening of the dark modes linewidth $\gamma_d$ by $20\,\text{meV}$ and shifts their energy by $10\,\text{meV}$ below the bare exciton frequency. Given that the polariton linewidth is $50\,\text{meV}$ and Rabi splitting is $150\,\text{meV}$, calculate the ratio of polariton decay rate to dark mode decay rate in this perturbed system.</question>

<question>  
An FDTD simulation implements a Lorentz bath via a set of auxiliary fields governed by  
$$\frac{d^2 P}{dt^2} + \gamma \frac{dP}{dt} + \omega_0^2 P = \varepsilon_0 f \omega_0^2 E(t).$$  
Discretize this equation using a Yee grid with time step $\Delta t=1\,\text{fs}$ and calculate the numerical value of the coefficient multiplying $P^{n}$ in the update equation  
$$P^{n+1} = m_1 P^{n} + m_2 P^{n-1} + m_3 E^{n}$$  
given $\omega_0 = 2\pi \times 5 \times 10^{14}\,\text{rad·s}^{-1}$ and $\gamma = 1 \times 10^{13}\,\text{rad·s}^{-1}$. Provide $m_1$ rounded to the nearest 0.001.</question>
=== Turn 0: Critic feedback ===
Here is a critique of each question against your given guidelines, followed by actionable feedback:

---

### Question 1

#### Strengths:
- **Chemistry Context:** It is set in a molecular ensemble in a microcavity (guideline 1).
- **Numerical Solution:** Requires a numerical answer (dimensionless coefficient $a$).
- **Multi-Step:** Involves translating a physical model into a finite-difference update (guideline 3).
- **Non-Standard:** Not just a textbook example (guideline 5).
- **Units:** Asks for a dimensionless number, which is appropriate.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- **Scenario specificity:** The "planar microcavity" and "molecular ensemble" context could be made more chemical by specifying the type of molecule or specific experimental system (guideline 1).
- **Redundancy/Clarity:** The question includes extraneous background (“auxiliary differential equation approach in an FDTD simulation”) that could be shortened.
- **Single solution:** The equation could be clarified to only require the $a$ coefficient. By asking “expressed as a ratio with respect to $P(t)$,” you risk slight ambiguity about whether $a$ is the only answer wanted.
- **Formatting:** Use $...$ instead of \(...\), properly formatted for Markdown (guideline 11).
- **Phrasing:** "assuming $P(t)$ and $P(t-\Delta t)$ are known" is redundant if you present only $a$ is needed.

**Actionable Feedback:**  
Specify a molecule or ensemble type for chemistry relevance, clarify that only the $a$ coefficient is required, and eliminate background detail that does not affect the calculation. Ensure all equations use $...$ for Markdown; phrase as: "Calculate the coefficient $a$ in the update $P(t+\Delta t) = a P(t) + ...$, to four decimal places."

---

### Question 2

#### Strengths:
- **Chemistry Scenario:** Cavity QED and Rabi splitting fit chemical physics.
- **Nomenclature:** All variables and constants well-defined (guideline 2, 7).
- **Single solution:** Only the upper polariton relaxation time is sought.
- **Conciseness:** No extraneous information (guideline 4).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- **Multi-Step:** There is calculation of rates, then conversion to time, but the steps are straightforward. Consider adding a real world system (e.g., what molecule).
- **Real-World Detail:** Relate to a realistic molecule or material (guideline 1).

**Actionable Feedback:**  
Add brief context about what molecular system is involved. Emphasize unit consistency and phrase, e.g., "Calculate the upper polariton relaxation time (in fs), given..."

---

### Question 3

#### Strengths:
- **Real Chemistry Setup:** Photonic crystal cavity + molecular ensemble is chemical.
- **Multi-Step:** Calculation requires conversions, formula use.
- **Single Solution:** One final value (guideline 6).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- **IUPAC Nomenclature:** The molecule is not named, but the transition dipole moment is specified numerically; consider specifying the molecular species (guideline 2).
- **Possible Redundancy:** The conversion factors for Debye are given; since the calculation is nontrivial, this is justified.
- **Phrasing:** Could clarify to avoid any ambiguity (state: “Calculate $\hbar \Omega_R$ in eV to three significant figures.”)

**Actionable Feedback:**  
Make the chemical system more explicit, suggest a molecular type, and clarify instruction as, "Calculate the collective Rabi splitting energy $\hbar \Omega_R$ in eV (three significant figures)."

---

### Question 4

#### Strengths:
- **Chemistry Reaction:** Molecular polaritons, disorder—advanced, nonstandard scenario.
- **Units:** Consistent throughout (meV, ratios).
- **Single solution:** Asks for a single ratio.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- **Mechanistic Detail:** The model (how disorder causes linewidth broadening and shifts) is just described as “introduced”; could state “…by introducing a disorder potential modeled by…” with quantitative or chemical context.
- **Scenario Detail:** No molecule or material context (guideline 1).
- **Complexity:** Multi-step calculation is present, but rationale for using the specific data (e.g., how polariton linewidth and Rabi splitting inform the answer) could be clearer.

**Actionable Feedback:**  
Specify molecular system/type, clarify mechanism, and state, “Calculate the ratio $\Gamma_{pol}/\Gamma_d$ (unitless) under these conditions…”

---

### Question 5

#### Strengths:
- **Realistic Chemistry:** FDTD with Lorentz bath models is a physical chemistry simulation.
- **Multi-Step:** Requires discretization, plugging in values, rounding.
- **Single solution:** Only $m_1$ coefficient needed.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- **Chemical Context:** Specify molecule or molecular excitation underpinning $\omega_0$.
- **Clarity in Phrasing:** Could clarify that only $m_1$ is required, e.g., “Provide $m_1$ (dimensionless).”
- **Use $...$ for Markdown rendering.

**Actionable Feedback:**  
Connect to a molecular absorption band, specify chemical context. Phrase as, "Discretize… Provide the coefficient $m_1$ (rounded to nearest 0.001)."

---

## General Recommendations

- **All questions:** Specify a real or modeled molecule/material for chemistry context (guideline 1).  
- **Equations:** Use proper Markdown-LaTeX formatting: $...$ for inline equations, $$...$$ for displayed equations.  
- **Single Solution:** State explicitly what the answer is (numerical value with specified units/significance), and avoid mentioning other coefficients unless required.  
- **Scenario:** Briefly link the mathematical context to a chemistry system.
- **Phrasing:** Use simple, direct language; avoid ambiguous phrases.
- **Units:** Always state the expected final unit.

## Example Rephrasing (for One Question):

> A planar microcavity contains an ensemble of anthracene molecules with Lorentz-bath susceptibility  
> $$\chi(\omega) = \frac{f \omega_0^2}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 - i \gamma \omega}$$  
> where $f=0.1$, $\omega_0 = 2.5 \times 10^{15}\,\text{rad s}^{-1}$ and $\gamma = 5 \times 10^{13}\,\text{rad s}^{-1}$. In an FDTD simulation (time step $\Delta t = 1 \times 10^{-18}$ s), the polarization $P$ is updated via

=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here is a concise, actionable critique of each question per your guidelines:

---

**Question 1** *(Planar microcavity: FDTD Lorentz-bath $a$ coefficient)*

- **Positives:**  
  - Realistic scenario (microcavity + anthracene).
  - Requires numerical answer for $a$ (dimensionless).
  - Multi-step reasoning: needs discretization of differential equation, parameter substitution, etc.
  - Concisely asked; consistent units.

- **Improvements:**  
  1. Slightly ambiguous whether the student should derive the FDTD recursion coefficients from the differential equation, or if the numerical update relation ($a$, $b$, $c$) is to be derived from first principles or given. Explicitly state "derive the finite-difference coefficients from the differential equation above" if so.
  2. The phrase "Lorentz-bath susceptibility" is non-standard; just use "Lorentz oscillator model".
  3. No redundancy.
  4. Specify all physical constants if needed (here, none missing).
  5. Scenario is sound and original.

---

**Question 2** *(Cavity QED: Upper polariton relaxation time)*

- **Positives:**  
  - Realistic cavity QED scenario, not a textbook example.
  - Unit consistency; solution is a single number with unit: "femtoseconds".
  - Requires conversion, use of equation with given physical constants; appropriately multi-step.
  - Concisely worded.

- **Improvements:**  
  1. The notation $\Gamma_{UP/LP}$ is fine, but make it clear "Calculate the relaxation time $\tau_{UP}$ for the upper polariton ($UP$)" to ensure only one answer.  
  2. No ambiguity, but minor: clarify if $\Omega_R$ is in units of energy or angular frequency for consistency in formulas (here it's in meV, so it's energy; formula should be checked that it uses energy form).

---

**Question 3** *(Photonic crystal: Collective Rabi splitting energy)*

- **Positives:**  
  - Original, chemistry-adjacent physical scenario (photonic crystal + dye molecules).
  - Requires unit conversions, multi-step calculation.
  - Asks for single numerical value, unit specified clearly.
  - No redundancy, clear and concise.

- **Improvements:**  
  - The formula provided uses $\Omega_R$, but result desired is $\hbar\Omega_R$ in eV. State "calculate $\hbar\Omega_R$ (in eV)" earlier for clarity.
  - All constants are given, but could specify whether $N$ is unitless ("number of molecules").
  - Good overall.

---

**Question 4** *(Organic polariton: Decay rate ratio)*

- **Positives:**  
  - Realistic, non-standard scenario.
  - Direct, only asks for ratio (dimensionless), so one solution.
  - Unit consistency.

- **Improvements:**  
  - Wording slightly ambiguous: does "polariton linewidth" mean total FWHM = $50$ meV, so decay rate $\Gamma_{pol} = 50$ meV$/\hbar$? Likewise for "dark mode decay rate" with the given linewidth? It may not be obvious to all students that $\gamma = \text{FWHM}$ and that decay rate is $\Gamma = \gamma/\hbar$.
  - Explicitly state: "Assume the decay rate $\Gamma = \gamma/\hbar$, where $\gamma$ is the linewidth (FWHM)."
  - Otherwise clear.

---

**Question 5** *(FDTD Lorentz oscillator update, $m_1$ coefficient)*

- **Positives:**  
  - Scenario is original and relevant (molecular FDTD).
  - Clear that answer is a numerical coefficient ($m_1$), one solution.
  - Multi-step: involves interpreting differential equation, discretization.

- **Improvements:**  
  - Use either SI units consistently for all given frequencies ($2\pi \times 5 \times 10^{14}\,\text{rad s}^{-1}$) or just $5 \times 10^{14}\,\text{Hz}$ or $3.14 \times 10^{15}\,\text{rad s}^{-1}$.
  - In the time step, say $1\,\text{fs} = 1 \times 10^{-15}\,\text{s}$ for clarity and consistency, or avoid mixing notation ($1\,\text{fs}$ and $1 \times 10^{-18}$ s in other problems).
  - Clarify that $P^n$ notation means $P(t_n)$ with $t_n = n \Delta t$, in case students are less familiar.

---

**General Feedback (All Questions):**
- Model chemistry-adjacent physics scenarios well—excellent originality and relevance.
- All questions yield only one answer; no multi-part confusion.
- Equations, variables, and numbers are well formatted (could be improved with inline math more consistently, but markdown is preserved).
- Avoid redundancy and extraneous scenario detail.
- Use rigorous, concise phrasing.
- Always state SI units for all constants/numbers directly to minimize error.
- For chemistry nomenclature, not directly tested here but best to avoid abbreviations if molecules appear in future.
- For FDTD and similar, clarify relation between physical and simulation notation if not utterly standard.

| Q# | Meets Guidelines? | Suggested Improvements                         |
|----|:-----------------:|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Yes (minor)       | Clarify coefficient derivation; standardize terminology |
| 2  | Yes (minor)       | Clarify which polariton; check formula units   |

| 4  | Yes (minor)       | Define decay rate vs. linewidth explicitly     |
| 5  | Yes (minor)       | Consistent units; clarify temporal notation    |

---

**Overall Actionable Recommendations:**
- Always explicitly map physical observables (linewidth, decay rate) to calculation formulae.
- Standardize frequency units across all problems ($\text{Hz}$ vs $\text{rad s}^{-1}$).
- Use only SI units for time/frequency unless scenario explicitly needs otherwise.
- For FDTD-style equation updates, specify notation conventions if not universal.
- Specify all parameters needed (and only those needed).

**Excellent advanced originality and difficulty!** With small clarifications, these questions would set a high standard for chemical physics assessment.

### General Assessment

The set of five questions is sophisticated, technically correct, and rooted in advanced physical chemistry and molecular photonics. They generally meet the spirit of the guidelines you listed, with a few issues that should be addressed for optimal assessment construction. Below are critiques and improvement suggestions for each question, followed by comments on alignment with your standards.

---

### 1. Anthracene Lorentz Oscillator FDTD Coefficient $a$

- **Strengths:**  
  - Realistic physical model (anthracene in microcavity).
  - Requires derivation (multi-step reasoning).
  - All parameters, including units, are provided.
  - Requires a single coefficient ($a$) rounded to four decimal places.
  - No extraneous data.
  - No ambiguity or extraneous parts.

- **Improvements:**
  - The question could be clearer about whether negative or positive values are expected for coefficients, to avoid ambiguity in sign.
  - Consider specifying "Give only the numerical value for $a$" for clarity (though this is minor).
  - Could be a little more concise: the phrase "the coefficient $a$ (dimensionless, multiplying $P(t)$)" could simply be "the dimensionless coefficient $a$."
  - The scenario is advanced, but arguably fits best in a physics/chemistry crossover; could be made slightly more chemistry-centered by specifying some chemical consequence or application.

---

### 2. Cavity QED Upper Polariton Lifetime

- **Strengths:**  
  - Clear physical scenario.
  - All constants and units specified.
  - Requires conversion and multi-step reasoning.
  - Single numerical answer expected, with specified units.

- **Improvements:**
  - Minor: Slight phrase complexity, e.g., "relaxation time $\tau_{UP} = 1/\Gamma_{UP}$ of the upper polariton, expressed in femtoseconds" could be "Calculate the upper polariton relaxation time, $\tau_{UP}$, in femtoseconds."
  - The scenario could include a more chemistry-specific detail (e.g., molecule class), but it's still sufficiently chemical.
  - No ambiguity; single solution.

---

### 3. Coumarin Collective Rabi Splitting

- **Strengths:**  
  - Realistic chemistry scenario and parameter set (coumarin, D. transition).
  - SI unit conversion necessary (multi-step).
  - Result is specifically requested in eV, rounded correctly.
  - Scenario is not a textbook copy; it’s original.

- **Improvements:**
  - Very minor: Consider specifying to "present only the numerical result" to remove any chance of unit ambiguity (though unlikely).
  - No superfluous details.

---

### 4. Polariton vs. Dark Mode Decay Rate Ratio

- **Strengths:**  
  - Detailed chemical scenario involving polariton and disorder effects.
  - Straightforward calculation with provided formula.
  - Requires multi-step calculation (convert energies to decay rates, compute ratio).
  - No ambiguity or extraneous information.

- **Improvements:**
  - Units are dropped after calculating the ratio (which is dimensionless), but could reinforce that by stating "Provide the ratio as a dimensionless number rounded to three significant figures."
  - Could restate "in this perturbed system" as "under these conditions" for conciseness, but that's a style point.

---

### 5. FDTD Yee Grid Lorentz Oscillator Update

- **Strengths:**  
  - Realistic numerical simulation scenario.
  - Requires discretizing a physics equation (deep reasoning).
  - All numbers given; coefficients clearly defined.
  - Only asks for $m_1$, with rounding clearly specified.

- **Improvements:**
  - Might drop the reference to "Yee grid" if not relevant to the update equation (unless you expect students to know the connection).
  - Could clarify that all calculation steps should be shown (if that's your goal), but the current ask is precise.

## General Suggestions

1. **Formatting Consistency:**  
   Consider ensuring equations use single dollar signs for inline and double for display style, as per your final instruction.

2. **Conciseness:**  
   Trim unnecessary descriptive words (e.g., in coefficient definitions), but not at the expense of clarity.

3. **Scenario Chemistry Focus:**  
   Some questions lean more on physics/simulation; to reinforce chemistry, perhaps add context such as molecular application or consequence.

4. **Explicit Single Value Instruction:**  
   Where numerical answers are expected, you might say "Provide only the numerical value," to reinforce guideline 6.

5. **Check Uniqueness and Complexity:**  
   All scenarios are unique. Consider rotating target molecules/parameters for even more breadth.

<question>  
A planar microcavity contains an ensemble of anthracene molecules characterized by the Lorentz oscillator model with susceptibility  
$$
\chi(\omega) = \frac{f \, \omega_0^2}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 - i \gamma \omega},
$$  
where the oscillator strength $f = 0.1$, resonance frequency $\omega_0 = 2.5 \times 10^{15}\,\mathrm{rad/s}$, and damping constant $\gamma = 5 \times 10^{13}\,\mathrm{rad/s}$.  

Starting from the differential equation for the polarization $P(t)$ corresponding to this model, derive the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) recursion relation  
$$
P(t+\Delta t) = a \, P(t) + b \, P(t-\Delta t) + c \, E(t),
$$  
using a second-order central finite-difference discretization with time step $\Delta t = 1 \times 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{s}$.  

Calculate the dimensionless coefficient $a$ multiplying $P(t)$ and provide only its numerical value rounded to four decimal places.

<question>  
In a cavity QED experiment involving organic molecules with exciton frequency $\omega_0 = 3 \times 10^{15}\,\mathrm{rad/s}$, the measured Rabi splitting energy is $\hbar \Omega_R = 140\,\mathrm{meV}$, and the bare molecular excitation lifetime is $\tau_0 = 200\,\mathrm{fs}$.  

Assuming the upper polariton relaxation rate $\Gamma_{UP}$ is given by  
$$
\Gamma_{UP} = \frac{1}{\tau_0} \left(1 + \frac{\hbar \Omega_R}{2 \hbar \omega_0}\right),
$$  
where $\hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-16}\,\mathrm{eV \cdot s}$,  

calculate the upper polariton relaxation time, $\tau_{UP} = 1/\Gamma_{UP}$, in femtoseconds. Provide only the numerical value.  
</question>

<question>  
A photonic crystal cavity mode couples to $N = 1 \times 10^{5}$ identical coumarin molecules, each with a transition dipole moment $\mu = 10\,\mathrm{D}$ and transition energy $\hbar \omega_0 = 2.0\,\mathrm{eV}$. Given the vacuum permittivity $\varepsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{F/m}$ and mode volume $V = 1 \times 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{m}^3$,  

calculate the collective Rabi splitting energy $\hbar \Omega_R$ in electronvolts using  
$$
\Omega_R = \sqrt{\frac{N \mu^2 \omega_0}{2 \hbar \varepsilon_0 V}},
$$  
where the transition dipole moment must be converted to SI units using $1\,\mathrm{D} = 3.33564 \times 10^{-30}\,C \cdot m$.  

Provide only the final value of $\hbar \Omega_R$ in eV rounded to three significant figures.

<question>  
In a molecular polariton system based on organic dye molecules, initially uncoupled dark modes acquire homogeneous broadening due to a disorder potential. This increases their linewidth $\gamma_d$ by $20\,\mathrm{meV}$ and shifts their energy $10\,\mathrm{meV}$ below the bare exciton resonance.  

Given that the polariton linewidth (full width at half maximum) is $\gamma_{pol} = 50\,\mathrm{meV}$ and the Rabi splitting energy is $\hbar \Omega_R = 150\,\mathrm{meV}$,  

and assuming the decay rates relate to linewidths by $\Gamma = \frac{\gamma}{\hbar}$,  

calculate the ratio of the polariton decay rate $\Gamma_{pol}$ to the dark mode decay rate $\Gamma_d$ under these conditions. Provide only the dimensionless ratio rounded to three significant figures.

<question>  
In a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation modeling the Lorentz oscillator response of a molecular excitation with resonance frequency $\omega_0 = 2\pi \times 5 \times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{rad/s}$ and damping constant $\gamma = 1 \times 10^{13}\,\mathrm{rad/s}$, the polarization $P(t)$ satisfies  
$$
\frac{d^2 P}{dt^2} + \gamma \frac{dP}{dt} + \omega_0^2 P = \varepsilon_0 f \, \omega_0^2 E(t).
$$  

Using a uniform time step $\Delta t = 1\,\mathrm{fs} = 1 \times 10^{-15}\,\mathrm{s}$, the polarization update follows  
$$
P^{n+1} = m_1 P^{n} + m_2 P^{n-1} + m_3 E^{n},
$$  
where $P^{n} = P(t_n)$ and $t_n = n \Delta t$.  

Calculate the coefficient $m_1$ (dimensionless, multiplying $P^{n}$) and provide only its numerical value rounded to the nearest 0.001.
