Assume the amount of charge transfer (in electrons per surface atom, $\Delta q$) is linearly proportional to the difference in Pauling electronegativity ($\chi$) between the two metals, scaled by a factor reflecting surface exposure: $\Delta q = \gamma * (x_{Fe} \chi_{Fe} - x_{Pt} \chi_{Pt})$, where $x_i$ is the surface mole fraction of metal $i$, $\gamma = 0.1$, and $\chi_{Fe} = 1.83$ and $\chi_{Pt} = 2.28$. The surface composition differs from the bulk composition; assume the surface is 70% Pt and 30% Fe ($x_{Pt} = 0.7, x_{Fe} = 0.3$).

"Adjusted Turnover Parameter Impact on Flux Distribution:

A metabolic model of *Bacillus subtilis* contains a reaction catalyzed by citrate synthase (EC 2.3.3.1). Initial Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) simulation using literature `$k_{cat}$` values leads to a predicted flux of `$5.0 \, \text{mmol} \, \text{gDW}^{-1} \, \text{hr}^{-1}$` through the citrate synthase reaction. After incorporating proteomic data, the adjusted turnover number for citrate synthase (`$k_{adj}$`) is determined to be 75% of the original literature value. Given that citrate synthase is flux-limiting in both simulations, recalculate the flux through the citrate synthase reaction (in `$\text{mmol} \, \text{gDW}^{-1} \, \text{hr}^{-1}$`) in the FBA model using the adjusted turnover number, assuming enzyme concentrations are unchanged."

Consider a simplified metabolic model with a single substrate uptake reaction and one metabolic pathway.

The metabolic pathway contains one enzymatic reaction, catalyzed by enzyme X, with a turnover number of `$k_{cat} = 80 \, s^{-1}$`. Assume that all the substrate taken up is processed through the enzyme X reaction. Determine the minimum enzyme concentration of X (in `$\mu\text{mol} \, \text{gDW}^{-1}$`) required to sustain the maximum substrate uptake rate. Ensure that all units are converted to match correctly."
