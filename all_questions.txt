Below is a refined set of four self‐contained, graduate‐level problems on quantized proton vortices in neutron-star matter.  Each asks for a single closed‐form symbolic result (to be given in LaTeX) and involves at least three distinct physical or mathematical steps (e.g. constitutive law, approximation or expansion, boundary conditions, integral or derivative).

1. Proton mass‐flux profile around a neutron vortex with entrainment  
A straight neutron vortex of circulation κ ẑ lies in a neutron‐star core.  For r > ξ (the vortex‐core radius), the azimuthal velocity of the neutron superfluid is  
  v_{nφ}(r)=κ/(2πr).  
The superconducting proton fluid (uniform mass density ρ_s) is entrained so that its momentum per unit volume is  
  p_p=ρ_s\,(v_p−ε v_n),   with 0<ε<1  
and in the London approximation  
  ∇×(v_p+ε v_n)=0.  
Requiring that v_{pφ}(r→∞)=0 and that v_{pφ}(r=ξ) remain finite, combine the entrainment relation with the London condition, integrate in r, and impose these boundary conditions to show that the proton mass‐flux density  
  j_{pφ}(r)=ρ_s v_{pφ}(r)  
for r>ξ is  
  \displaystyle j_{pφ}(r)=ρ_s\,ε\,\frac{κ}{2πr}\Bigl(1-\frac{ξ}{r}\Bigr)\,.  

2. Lateral force on a slightly tilted flux‐carrying vortex  
A straight proton vortex of length L carries one flux quantum Φ=h/(2e) along its axis.  In a uniform external field B_0ẑ, its magnetic interaction energy is  
  U(α)=−(Φ B_0/μ_0)\,L cos α,  
where α≪1 is the small tilt from the z‐axis (so the top end is displaced by δx=L sin α≈L α).  (i) Expand U(α) to first order in α, (ii) relate δx to α, and (iii) compute the lateral force f_x=−dU/d(δx).  Show that, to leading order, the magnitude of the lateral force per unit length is  
  \displaystyle f_x=\frac{Φ\,B_0}{μ_0}\,.  

3. Transverse (Magnus) force via the momentum‐flux tensor  
A straight proton vortex carrying circulation κ ẑ moves with velocity v_L through a proton superfluid of uniform density ρ_s and far‐field velocity v_s.  The ideal‐fluid momentum‐flux tensor is  
  Π_{ij}=ρ_s v_{si} v_{sj}+p δ_{ij},  
where the pressure term integrates to zero around a cylindrical surface at radius r≫ξ.  By evaluating the surface integral F_i=∮Π_{ij} n_j dS on a cylinder coaxial with the vortex and then taking r→∞, derive the net transverse force per unit length and show  
  \displaystyle f_T=ρ_s\,κ\,\hat z\times\bigl(v_s-v_L\bigr)\,.  

4. Oblique shear–Alfvén–vortex‐lattice dispersion  
In a superconducting neutron‐star core the proton superfluid (density ρ_s) supports a uniform magnetic field B_0ẑ and a triangular vortex lattice of shear modulus G_v.  Define the Alfvén and lattice speeds  
  c_A=\frac{B_0}{\sqrt{μ_0 ρ_s}},  
  c_v=\sqrt{\frac{G_v}{ρ_s}}\,.  
Consider small transverse Lagrangian displacements ξ(x,t)=ξ_0 e^{i(k·x−ωt)} with |k|=k and k·ẑ=k cos θ.  By linearizing the ideal‐MHD induction equation, writing the elastic stress of the lattice, and combining them to eliminate the magnetic and elastic fields, derive the dispersion relation  
  \displaystyle ω^2=k^2\bigl(c_A^2\cos^2θ+c_v^2\sin^2θ\bigr)\,.

Work in natural units ℏ=c=1.  In each problem you are asked for one final symbolic formula.  All symbols needed in that formula are defined below.

1) Type-I seesaw with gauge correction  
  Setup: A single SM neutrino νL and a heavy Majorana N give the mass terms  
    L⊃−y ν̄L H̃ N−½ M N̄N^c,  
  where H̃ is the Higgs doublet, M≫y v and v=⟨H⟩.  At tree level mν^(0)=y² v²/M.  One‐loop W and B exchange between the two νL legs yields a correction Δmν of order (mν^(0)/(16π²))(g2²+g1²) ln(Λ/M).  
  Question:  Derive  
    mν(Λ)=mν^(0) [1 + (g2²+g1²)/(16π²) ln(Λ/M)]  
  accurate to O[(g2²+g1²) ln(Λ/M)].  
  Definitions: y (Yukawa), v (Higgs VEV), M (Majorana mass), g2 (SU(2)L gauge coupling), g1 (U(1)Y gauge coupling), Λ (UV cutoff).

2) Higgs-mass renormalization with a vectorlike quark  
  Setup: A real scalar H couples to the SM top t and a vectorlike quark Q via yt t̄t H+ yQ Q̄Q H.  In a sharp cutoff Λ, the one‐loop 1PI self‐energy at zero momentum is  
    Π(0)=−(3 yt²+3 yQ²)/(8π²) Λ².  
  The physical Higgs mass‐squared is mH².  Question:  Compute the bare mass‐squared m0²(Λ) that yields mH² after including Π(0), keeping only O(Λ²).  
  Definition: yt, yQ (Yukawa couplings), mH (physical Higgs mass), Λ.

3) Active–sterile oscillations with two potentials  
  Setup: Two ultrarelativistic neutrino states νa, νs (E≫mi) mix by angle θ and propagate in constant matter potentials Va, Vs.  The Hamiltonian (in the flavor basis) is  
    H = (1/2E) U diag(m1²,m2²) Uᵀ + diag(Va,Vs),  
  with U = [[cosθ, sinθ], [−sinθ, cosθ]] and Δm² ≡ m2²−m1².  The oscillation length is Lm=2π/(E2−E1), where E2−E1 is the splitting of H’s eigenvalues.  
  Question:  Derive a closed‐form expression for  
    Lm(E,Δm²,θ,Va,Vs)  
  in terms of E, Δm², θ, Va, Vs.  Ensure your result has dimensions of length.

4) One-loop running of sin²θW with an extra SU(2)L triplet  
  Setup: The gauge couplings g1(μ), g2(μ) obey  
    dg_i/dt = (b_i/16π²) g_i³,   t=ln μ,   i=1,2,  
  in a model where b1 and b2 include the SM plus one extra SU(2)L triplet.  Define tanθW(μ)=g1(μ)/g2(μ) and sin²θW≡tan²θW/(1+tan²θW).  
  Question:  Derive sin²θW(μ) in closed form in terms of g1(μ₀), g2(μ₀), b1, b2, and ln(μ/μ₀).

1) Beam deflection in uniform gravity and magnetic gradient  
A collimated beam of antihydrogen atoms of inertial mass m is emitted horizontally with kinetic energy E and traverses a region of length L in which it experiences a uniform downward gravitational acceleration g and a uniform upward magnetic force F_m=μ (dB/dy).  Assume the horizontal speed is v=√(2E/m) (so that the horizontal motion is unperturbed) and that the vertical deflection is small.  Derive the vertical deflection Δy at the end of the region in terms of m, E, L, g, μ, and dB/dy.

2) Gravitational phase shift in a Mach–Zehnder interferometer  
Antihydrogen atoms of mass m travel at constant speed v along the two horizontal arms of a Mach–Zehnder interferometer.  The upper arm has length L+δL, the lower arm length L−δL, and the two arms lie at vertical separation Δh in a uniform gravitational field g.  Neglect any change of speed due to gravity along each arm.  Derive the gravitationally induced phase difference Δφ between the two paths in terms of m, g, Δh, L, δL, v, and ℏ.

3) Equilibrium height in a quadratic magnetic trap  
An antihydrogen atom of mass m₀ experiences a magnetic potential  
 U_mag(z)=½ μ B″ z²  (with B″>0)  
and a gravitational potential  
 U_grav(z)=η m₀ g z.  
Find the equilibrium height z_eq (the value of z at which d [U_mag+U_grav]/dz=0) in terms of η, m₀, g, μ, and B″.

4) Small‐angle differential cross section for Yukawa‐screened gravity  
Two identical neutral particles of mass m carry “gravitational charges” q_{g1}=ξ₁ m and q_{g2}=ξ₂ m, interacting via the Yukawa‐screened potential  
 V(r)=−G ξ₁ m · ξ₂ m e^(−r/λ)/r.  
Using the first Born approximation and keeping only the leading term for scattering angles θ≪1, derive the differential cross section dσ/dΩ as a function of m, v, G, ξ₁, ξ₂, λ, and θ.

5) Asymptotic level spacing of the gravitational quantum bouncer  
An antihydrogen atom of mass m bounces above a perfectly reflecting mirror at z=0 under a constant effective acceleration g_eff.  The time‐independent Schrödinger equation admits bound states E_n (n=1,2,3,…).  Using the WKB approximation in the limit n≫1, derive the asymptotic spacing  
 ΔE_n = E_{n+1} − E_n  
in terms of m, g_eff, ℏ, and n.

Below is a revised set of five standalone problems.  Each asks for one symbolic result (in LaTeX) and requires at least two distinct analytic steps.  No near-final formula is given in any stem, and there is no multipart (a),(b) … structure.

1) Non-planar One-Loop Self-Energy in NC φ⁴  
Consider the non-planar one-loop two-point function with hard cutoff Λ,  
 Σ_np(p) = \frac{g^2}{6}\!\int_{|k|<Λ}\!\frac{d^4k}{(2π)^4}\,\frac{e^{i\,k_μ θ^{μν}p_ν}}{k^2 + m^2}\!,  
where p∘p ≡ p_μ θ^{μρ}θ_{ρν} p^ν.  In the regime  
 m ≪ Λ, p∘p Λ² ≪ 1,  
derive the leading-order expansion of Σ_np(p), keeping both the constant term and the term ∝ ln(Λ² p∘p), and dropping all O((p∘p)²) contributions.  Express your final answer in terms of g, Λ, m and p∘p.

2) Unique Stationary Point of a Relaxion  
The relaxion potential is  
 V(φ) = g Λ³ φ + Λ_b⁴ cos(φ/f),  
with the given inequality  
 g Λ³ f < Λ_b⁴.  
Show that there is exactly one solution φ∈(0,πf) of  
 dV/dφ = 0  
and express that φ in closed form.

3) HWW Coupling‐Deviation Series in ε  
Define ε ≡ v²/f² and  
 δ_W ≡ \frac{g_{HWW} - g_{\rm SM}}{g_{\rm SM}},  
with  
 g_{HWW} = g_{\rm SM}\sqrt{1 - ε}.  
First rewrite δ_W in terms of ε, then expand it as a power series up to and including O(ε³).  Give the result in closed form.

4) h→γγ Fractional Shift from an Extra Heavy Fermion  
The SM top (mass m_t, charge Q_t) and a new fermion t′ (mass m_{t'} , charge Q_{t'}) both have N_c = 3 colours and couple to the Higgs.  In the limit neglecting all O(v²/m_i²) terms, the low-energy Higgs theorem gives  
 A(h→γγ) ∝ ∑_{i=t,t'} N_c Q_i² ∂_{\ln v}\ln m_i(v).  
Using only this relation, derive the fractional shift  
 δ_γ ≡ \frac{A(h→γγ)_{\rm SM+t'} - A(h→γγ)_{\rm SM}}{A(h→γγ)_{\rm SM}}  
in terms of Q_t, Q_{t'}, m_t and m_{t'}.

5) Vacuum-Energy Curvature under a Light Parameter θ  
N real scalars φ_i have masses m_i(θ)=m_i^0 + α_i θ; N Weyl fermions have θ-independent masses.  At one loop (up to θ-independent terms) the vacuum energy is  
 ρ_{\rm vac}(θ)=\frac{1}{64π^2}\sum_{i=1}^N m_i(θ)^4\ln\!\bigl[\tfrac{m_i(θ)^2}{μ^2}\bigr].  
Compute  
 \left.\frac{d^2ρ_{\rm vac}}{dθ^2}\right|_{θ=0}  
in closed form, showing explicitly how each derivative acts on m_i(θ).

1) Seesaw with a Small Light–Light Majorana Term  
Consider two left-handed neutrinos ν₁, ν₂ and a heavy Majorana neutrino N with mass matrix  
M = ⎛0   μ   m₁  
        μ   0   m₂  
       m₁  m₂   M⎞,  
where M≫|m_i|,|μ|.  Block-diagonalise perturbatively to first order in m_i/M and μ/M, dropping O(m_i²/M, μ²/M, m_iμ/M) terms.  Derive the resulting 2×2 light-neutrino mass matrix m_ν and express it as one compact LaTeX formula in μ, m₁, m₂ and M.

2) One-Loop Stop Correction in the MSSM  
In the MSSM decoupling limit at scale Q = m̃, use the one-loop effective potential to compute the stop contribution Δm_h² to the light CP-even Higgs mass.  Assume two degenerate soft-stop masses m̃, a top mass m_t and stop-mixing parameter X_t.  Retain only terms ∝ m_t² ln(m̃²/m_t²) and ∝ m_t² X_t²/m̃², dropping all others.  Provide Δm_h² as a single LaTeX expression in m_t, v, m̃, X_t and ln(m̃²/m_t²).

3) Neutrinoless Double-β Decay Bound  
Given  
(T_{1/2})⁻¹ = G₀(A)\,|M_N|²\,|m_{ββ}|²/m_e²  
and the experimental limit T_{1/2} ≥ T_{\rm exp}, derive an upper bound on |m_{ββ}| (in eV) by reinstating ℏ and c.  Express the result as one LaTeX inequality in G₀(A), |M_N|, m_e, ℏc and T_{\rm exp}.

4) ν_e→ν_s Survival Probability  
For the two-flavor vacuum Hamiltonian  
H = (Δm²/4E)\bigl(−cos2θ σ_z + sin2θ σ_x\bigr)  
in a ν_e–ν_s system, diagonalise H and derive P_{ee}(L) in ℏ = c = 1 units.  Provide P_{ee}(L) as one compact LaTeX line.

5) Inelastic WIMP Minimum Speed  
A dark-matter particle χ (mass m_χ) scatters inelastically off a stationary nucleus (mass m_N), exciting χ by energy δ and producing nuclear recoil E_R.  With μ = m_χ m_N/(m_χ + m_N) and neglecting binding-energy corrections, apply energy and momentum conservation to find the minimum lab-frame speed v_{\min}(E_R).  Express v_{\min}(E_R) as a single LaTeX expression in E_R, μ, m_N and δ.
