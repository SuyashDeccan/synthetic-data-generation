A one-dimensional non-Hermitian system is described by a Hamiltonian with a spatially varying gain/loss profile. The Hamiltonian is given by $H = p^2/2m - i\gamma(x)$, where $p$ is the momentum operator, $m$ is the mass, and $\gamma(x) = \gamma_0 \text{sech}^2(x/L)$, with $\gamma_0 > 0$ representing the maximum gain/loss strength and $L$ the characteristic length of the gain/loss region. Assume that the system is initially in its ground state in the absence of gain/loss ($\gamma_0 = 0$).

Suddenly the gain/loss is switched on to a value of $\gamma_0$. The system is then allowed to evolve for a long time $T$. Due to the non-Hermiticity, the norm of the wave function changes in time.

Consider a non-Hermitian quantum system with a Hamiltonian $H = H_0 + iW$, where $H_0$ is a Hermitian Hamiltonian describing a free particle in a one-dimensional box of length $L$ with periodic boundary conditions, and $W$ is a non-Hermitian perturbation given by $W = \gamma \sum_n |n\rangle \langle n|$, where $\gamma$ is a real number, and $|n\rangle$ represents the position basis states.

Suppose we discretize the position space into $N$ equally spaced points. The initial state is a superposition of the first two eigenstates of $H_0$ with equal amplitudes. We want to study the dynamics of this system numerically using the standard Crank-Nicolson method. The Crank-Nicolson method gives the time-evolved state $|\psi(t+\Delta t)\rangle$ by solving the equation: $(1 + i \Delta t H / 2) |\psi(t+\Delta t)\rangle = (1 - i \Delta t H / 2) |\psi(t)\rangle$.

After a time $t=t_f$, we observe that the norm of the wave function is significantly reduced due to the non-Hermitian term. It is known that the relative error in the norm of the wave function obtained using the Crank-Nicolson method is approximately $C \cdot t_f \cdot (\Delta t)^2$, where $C = 0.5 \cdot E_{max}^2$, and $E_{max}$ represents the maximum absolute value of the complex energy eigenvalues (spectral radius) of $H$. Given $H_0 = \frac{p^2}{2m} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$, $L = 1$, $N=100$, $\hbar=1$, $m=1$, $\gamma = 0.1$, and $t_f = 10$, determine a reasonable maximum value for the time step $\Delta t$ such that the relative error in the norm of the wave function obtained using the Crank-Nicolson method is less than 10%.

For the TEBD algorithm, one typically decomposes the time evolution operator $e^{-i H \Delta t}$ into a product of two-site gates using a Suzuki-Trotter decomposition. Suppose the system has parameters $L = 10$, $t = 1$, $U = 5$, $\mu_0 = 4$, $\mu_f = 2$. Given a target accuracy such that the truncation error after evolving for a time $t_f=10$ should be below $10^{-4}$, and knowing that the entanglement entropy after the quench grows linearly with a rate of approximately $s=0.5$, estimate the minimum required bond dimension $\chi$ for the MPS representation to achieve this accuracy. Assume that the bond dimension scales exponentially with the entanglement entropy.

The cross-section for $e^+e^- \rightarrow D^+D^-$ near the $\psi(2S)$ resonance is observed to be significantly enhanced compared to predictions from a simple continuum model. This enhancement is attributed to the $\psi(2S)$ acting as a subthreshold pole. Assume the measured cross-section can be described by the Breit-Wigner form, convoluted with the beam energy spread $\sigma_E$. The observed cross-section is given by:

Assume Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) contributes to the amplitudes for these processes. The total amplitude for each final state can be written as the sum of a continuum amplitude ($A_{cont}$) and a resonant amplitude mediated by the $\psi(2S)$ ($A_{res}$). The resonant amplitude is proportional to the propagator of the $\psi(2S)$ and its coupling to the respective final state.

Specifically, let the amplitude for $e^+e^- \rightarrow D^+D^-$ be $A(D^+D^-) = A_{cont}(D^+D^-) + \frac{g_{e^+e^- \rightarrow \psi(2S)} g_{\psi(2S) \rightarrow D^+D^-}}{E - M + i\Gamma/2}$ and similarly for $e^+e^- \rightarrow D^0\bar{D}^0$.

Assume the continuum amplitudes are real and positive, with $|A_{cont}(D^+D^-)|= a$ and $|A_{cont}(D^0\bar{D}^0)| = b$. Further assume $|g_{e^+e^- \rightarrow \psi(2S)}|= c$, $|g_{\psi(2S) \rightarrow D^+D^-}| = d$ and $|g_{\psi(2S) \rightarrow D^0\bar{D}^0}|=e$. Also assume that by convention, the phases of $g_{\psi(2S) \rightarrow D^+D^-}$ and $g_{\psi(2S) \rightarrow D^0\bar{D}^0}$ are chosen such that the resonant amplitudes are real and positive at $E = M$. Find the ratio of the cross-sections for $e^+e^- \rightarrow D^+D^-$ to $e^+e^- \rightarrow D^0\bar{D}^0$, i.e., calculate $\sigma(D^+D^-) / \sigma(D^0\bar{D}^0)$ at $E = M$, where the cross-section $\sigma$ is proportional to $|A|^2$. Express your answer in terms of $a, b, c, d, e, $ and $\Gamma$.

To respect low-energy behavior dictated by chiral perturbation theory (ChPT), a modification is proposed: $\rho'(s) = \rho(s) \cdot (1 + c_1 s + c_2 s^2)$, where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are constants related to low energy constants (LECs). Assume that unitarity imposes a constraint on the integrated spectral density, specifically that $\int_{0}^{\infty} \rho'(s) ds = C$, where $C$ is a known constant derived from unitarity bounds on partial waves. Given $M = 770$ MeV, $\Gamma = 150$ MeV, $c_1 = 1 \times 10^{-6} \text{ MeV}^{-2}$, $c_2 = -5 \times 10^{-12} \text{ MeV}^{-4}$ and $C = 1000 \text{ MeV}^2$, and that the integral of the *modified* spectral density *without* the normalization constant is given by $\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{M^2 \Gamma^2}{(s - M^2)^2 + M^2 \Gamma^2} \cdot (1 + c_1 s + c_2 s^2) ds = 0.85 \times 10^{10} \text{ MeV}^2$, determine the normalization constant $N$ (in units of $\text{MeV}^{-2}$) required to satisfy the unitarity constraint. Note that the integration limits represent approximations.

**Question:**
Consider the $\pi K$ scattering amplitude. The $K^*(892)$ resonance contributes significantly to the $P$-wave scattering. Near the resonance, the $T$-matrix element for the $P$-wave can be written as $T(s) = \frac{g^2}{M^2 - s - iM\Gamma(s)}$, where $M$ is the resonance mass, $\Gamma(s)$ is the energy-dependent width, and $g$ is the coupling constant. The energy-dependent width can be expressed as $\Gamma(s) = \Gamma_0 (\frac{p(s)}{p(M^2)}) (\frac{M^2}{s})$, where $\Gamma_0$ is the width at the resonance pole, and $p(s) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{s}}\sqrt{[s - (m_K + m_\pi)^2][s - (m_K - m_\pi)^2]}$ is the magnitude of the center-of-mass momentum in the $\pi K$ system. Here, $m_K = 494$ MeV and $m_\pi = 139.6$ MeV are the masses of the kaon and pion, respectively. Assume that the $K^*(892)$ resonance mass is extracted from the real part of the pole position in the complex s-plane, defined by $M^2 - s - iM\Gamma(s) = 0$. Further, the width is extracted from the imaginary part such that $\Gamma_0 = \Gamma(M^2)$. Given that from experimental data and dispersion relation analyses, we extract a coupling constant $g = 6.0$, determine the magnitude of the T-matrix $|T(s)|$ (as a dimensionless number) at $s = M^2$, where $M = 892$ MeV and $\Gamma_0 = 50$ MeV.

**Question:**
In the context of Gauge Theory Bootstrap (GTB) methodology, consider a four-point scattering amplitude $A(s, t, u)$ of massless particles in a conformal field theory (CFT). Assume that the amplitude can be decomposed into a sum of conformal blocks $G_{\Delta, \ell}(z, \bar{z})$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\ell$ is the spin. Close to the Regge limit, where $s \rightarrow \infty$ and $t$ is fixed, the leading Regge trajectory is governed by the exchange of a "Pomeron" with intercept $\alpha(0) = 1 + \epsilon$. Assume that this Pomeron exchange can be approximated by a single conformal block with $\Delta = 1 + \epsilon + \ell$ (where $\ell = 0$), and where $\epsilon$ is a small parameter related to the anomalous dimension. The four-point function can then be described by $A(s,t) = g^2 (\frac{s}{s_0})^{\epsilon}F(t)$, where $g$ is the coupling strength, $s_0$ is an arbitrary energy scale, and $F(t)$ is a form factor dependent only on $t$.

Assume that the low energy constant (LEC) corresponding to the strength of a particular chiral Lagrangian interaction term is related to this Regge behavior by amplitude matching. Assume the LEC, denoted as $L$, is given by $L = \frac{g^2}{\Lambda_c^{1.8}s_0^{\epsilon}} \int_{t_{min}}^{0} F(t) dt$, where $\Lambda_c=1 \text{ GeV}$ is a characteristic energy scale, and $t_{min}$ is the kinematic lower limit for $t$. The constant $\Lambda_c$ has been introduced so that the LEC, $L$, is dimensionless.  If $g = 5$, $s_0 = 1 \text{ GeV}^2$, $\epsilon = 0.1$, and $F(t) = e^{t/\Lambda^2}$ where $\Lambda = 0.5 \text{ GeV}$, and $t_{min} = -0.1 \text{ GeV}^2$, calculate the value of the dimensionless LEC, $L$.
