**Question:**
Consider a quantum experiment designed to investigate time-frequency entanglement. Two photons, A and B, are generated through spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in a type-I crystal. Assume that initially, photon A is in a frequency mode $\omega_A$ and photon B is in a frequency mode $\omega_B$. Photon A then passes through an electro-optic modulator (EOM), which applies a time-dependent phase $\phi(t) = \alpha \sin(\Omega t)$, where $\alpha$ is the modulation amplitude and $\Omega$ is the modulation frequency. Assume only the carrier and first-order sidebands contribute significantly to the detected frequencies. Both photons then pass through a symmetric beam splitter with amplitude transmissivity $T$ and amplitude reflectivity $R$, such that $|T|^2+|R|^2=1$. Assuming the frequency difference makes the photons distinguishable at the beam splitter inputs, calculate the probability, $P_{D1,D2}$, of detecting one photon at detector D1 with frequency $\omega_A + \Omega$ and the other at detector D2 with frequency $\omega_B$. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $\alpha$, $\Omega$, $T$, and $R$.

### Question ID: 6cfbfdeb3aaf4472a2367b97a2f38d3a
**Question:**
In a quantum experiment, four photons (A, B, C, and D) are generated. Assume the initial state is a product state of specific frequency modes: $|\psi\rangle = |\omega_A\rangle |\omega_B\rangle |\omega_C\rangle |\omega_D\rangle$. Acousto-optic modulators (AOMs) are used to manipulate the frequencies of photons A and C. The AOMs are configured to shift the frequency to a single new value, such that photon A has frequency $\omega_A' = \omega_A + \Delta \omega$ and photon C has frequency $\omega_C' = \omega_C - \Delta \omega$. Photons B and D retain their initial frequencies $\omega_B$ and $\omega_D$. All four photons are then combined in a lossless, symmetric four-port beam splitter, where each input mode is equally likely to exit any output port. Assuming all photons are distinguishable by their frequency, calculate the probability, $P_{D1,D2,D3,D4}$, that *one photon* is detected at each of four separate detectors (D1, D2, D3, D4) if the detected frequencies are $\omega_A'$, $\omega_B$, $\omega_C'$, and $\omega_D$ respectively. Provide your answer as a single numerical value.

**Question:**
A source generates photon pairs via Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC). One photon (idler) is subjected to electro-optic phase modulation (EOM). The EOM introduces a sinusoidal phase modulation $\phi(t) = A \sin(2\pi f_m t)$, where $A$ is the modulation index and $f_m$ is the modulation frequency. The signal photon passes directly to a detector D1. The idler photon passes through the EOM and then to detector D2. Both detectors are frequency selective, with D1 only registering photons at the signal frequency $\omega_s$, and D2 only registering photons at the first-order sideband frequency $\omega_i + f_m$, where $\omega_i$ is the original idler frequency.  Considering only the first-order sidebands generated by the EOM, and assuming $A \ll 1$, calculate the coincidence rate, $CR$, (number of coincident detections at D1 and D2 per unit time) relative to the rate without the EOM (i.e. $A=0$). Express your answer in terms of $A$. You can assume the SPDC source produces a constant flux of photon pairs.

**Question:**
Consider a quantum experiment involving the generation of photons using a pulsed laser. These photons are passed through a spectral filter with a transmission profile $T(\omega) = \exp\left(-\frac{(\omega - \omega_0)^4}{2\sigma^4}\right)$, where $\omega_0$ is the central frequency of the filter and $\sigma$ is a parameter related to its spectral width. Assume the initial spectral distribution of the photons emitted by the source is Gaussian, centered at $\omega_s$ with a width $\sigma_s$, given by $S(\omega) = \exp\left(-\frac{(\omega - \omega_s)^2}{2\sigma_s^2}\right)$.  To ensure high spectral purity of the generated photons, the filter width $\sigma$ is much smaller than the source bandwidth $\sigma_s$ (i.e., $\sigma \ll \sigma_s$). Calculate the reduction factor, $RF$, in the number of photons after passing through the filter, relative to the number of photons that would have passed if there were no filter (i.e., $T(\omega) = 1$ for all $\omega$). Give your answer in terms of $\sigma$, $\sigma_s$, $\omega_0$ and $\omega_s$. Assume that both $\sigma$ and $\sigma_s$ are much smaller than $\omega_0$ and $\omega_s$.  You may leave your answer in terms of definite integrals, as the analytical solution is not straightforward.

**Question:**
A radially chirped Gaussian beam with a central wavelength of $\lambda_0 = 1064 \, \mathrm{nm}$ and a pulse duration of $\tau_0 = 100 \, \mathrm{fs}$ (full width at half maximum) is generated. The beam's radial chirp is such that the wavelength varies linearly with the radial distance $r$ from the beam's center, described by $\lambda(r) = \lambda_0 + \alpha r$, where $\alpha = 1 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{m}^{-1}$. This radial chirp also leads to a broadening of the beam's overall spectral bandwidth. The initial beam waist (radius at $1/e^2$ intensity) is $w_0 = 2 \, \mathrm{mm}$. This beam is sent through a specially designed pulse compressor. The pulse compressor is designed to compensate for the radial chirp by introducing a spatially varying group delay, effectively compressing the broadened spectral bandwidth. Assuming the pulse compressor perfectly compensates the radial chirp, what is the duration of the shortest pulse (in femtoseconds) obtainable at the output? Assume a transform-limited pulse shape and that the initial pulse duration $\tau_0$ corresponds to the transform limit of the *un-chirped* central wavelength.

**Question:**
A community-developed generator is used to simulate $B^0 \rightarrow K^{*0} \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays. The generator initially assumes a flat angular distribution for the $K^{*0}$ decay products. However, experimental data suggests an angular dependence described by $f(\cos\theta) = 1 + \alpha \cos^2\theta$, where $\alpha = 0.5$ and $\theta$ is the angle between the $K^+$ and the $B^0$ meson direction in the $K^{*0}$ rest frame. To reweight the generated events to match the experimental distribution, each event is assigned a weight $w = \frac{f(\cos\theta)}{f_{flat}}$. If $f_{flat}$ is the flat angular distribution normalized to unity over the kinematic range $\cos\theta \in [-1, 1]$, what is the value of $w$ for an event with $\cos\theta = 0.8$?

A new analysis targets events with missing transverse energy, $E_T^{miss}$, arising from weakly interacting dark matter candidates. To optimize the signal selection, phase-space cuts are applied to $E_T^{miss}$ and the transverse momentum of the leading jet, $p_T^{jet}$. Assume the signal efficiency increases linearly with the $E_T^{miss}$ cut as $\epsilon_{signal}(E_T^{miss}) = 0.01 \cdot E_T^{miss}$ (where $E_T^{miss}$ is in $\mathrm{GeV}$), and the background events decrease exponentially with the same cut as $N_{background}(E_T^{miss}) = 1000 \cdot e^{-0.005 \cdot E_T^{miss}}$. Find the optimal $E_T^{miss}$ cut (in $\mathrm{GeV}$) that maximizes the signal significance, defined as $S = \frac{\epsilon_{signal}}{\sqrt{N_{background}}}$.

**Question:**
A novel analysis of top quark pair production ($t\bar{t}$) uses a boosted decision tree (BDT) to discriminate between signal and background events. The BDT output score ranges from -1 to 1, with higher scores indicating a higher likelihood of being a signal event. To assess the impact of a new systematic uncertainty, a new BDT is trained incorporating this uncertainty. The mean BDT output score for signal events shifts from 0.6 to 0.55, while the standard deviation remains constant at 0.2. Assuming Gaussian distributions for the BDT output score, calculate the fractional change in the area under the signal curve above a BDT score threshold of 0.7, due to the shift in the mean. (Express the answer as a percentage, $\frac{Area_{new} - Area_{old}}{Area_{old}} \cdot 100\%$).

**Question:**
In a heavy-ion collision, the measured elliptic flow, $v_2$, of charged particles is affected by both genuine collective flow and non-flow effects such as jet-particle correlations. Assume that the observed $v_2^{obs}$ can be decomposed into a flow component, $v_2^{flow}$, and a non-flow component, $v_2^{non-flow}$, such that $v_2^{obs} = v_2^{flow} + v_2^{non-flow}$. The non-flow component is estimated using a two-particle correlation method, yielding $v_2^{non-flow} = A/\sqrt{N}$, where $A$ is a constant and $N$ is the number of particles used in the correlation. The observed $v_2$ is measured as a function of centrality, and it is found that $v_2^{obs} = 0.15$ for peripheral collisions with $N = 100$ at a centrality of $C=70$, and $v_2^{obs} = 0.25$ for central collisions with $N = 1000$ at a centrality of $C=10$.
