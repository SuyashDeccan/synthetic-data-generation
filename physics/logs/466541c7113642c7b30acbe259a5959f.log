Here's a critique of each question based on the provided guidelines:

---

**Question 1: Relativistic Doppler Effect (Wavelength)**

*   **Critique:** This question successfully models a physics scenario, is concisely phrased, uses correct units and formatting, and yields a single numerical solution. However, it falls short on "Force Multi-Step Reasoning" and "Be Unique." The calculation is a direct application of the relativistic Doppler formula.
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    1.  **Multi-Step Reasoning:** To enhance, consider providing the observer's kinetic energy instead of velocity. This would require calculating the relativistic velocity ($v$) first, using $T = (\gamma - 1)m_e c^2$ or similar, before applying the Doppler formula.
    2.  **Uniqueness:** This is a very standard problem. If similar relativistic Doppler questions appear elsewhere (like Q7), one should be removed or significantly altered to be distinct.

---

**Question 2: Illuminance**

*   **Critique:** This question clearly models a scenario, is well-phrased, correctly formatted, and has a single solution. It includes a common distracter (detector radius) which tests careful reading. However, it primarily involves a direct application of the illuminance formula ($E=I/d^2$), thus lacking genuine "Multi-Step Reasoning" in the sense of combining multiple physical principles or calculations.
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    1.  **Multi-Step Reasoning:** To force more steps, ask for the *total luminous flux incident on the detector* instead of illuminance. This would require calculating the solid angle subtended by the detector ($\Omega = A/d^2$ or $\Omega = 2\pi(1-\cos\alpha)$) and then the flux ($\Phi_v = I\Omega$). Alternatively, ask for both total flux *and* average illuminance on the detector, requiring the detector's area.
    2.  **Uniqueness:** The problem setup is standard. Consider a scenario where the source is not isotropic, or the detector is not normal to the incident light.

---

**Question 3: Compton Scattering**

*   **Critique:** This question is strong. It effectively models a scenario, is concisely phrased, uses correct units and formatting, and yields a single numerical solution. Crucially, it successfully "Forces Multi-Step Reasoning" by requiring conversion between energy and wavelength, application of the Compton formula, and then conversion back to energy.
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    1.  **Uniqueness:** While the problem itself is well-constructed, Compton scattering is a standard topic. To make it more unique, perhaps embed it within a broader context (e.g., analyzing a spectrum from an X-ray source, or considering recoil electron energy). However, for a direct test of Compton scattering, it is effective.

---

**Question 4: Cherenkov Radiation**

*   **Critique:** This question is excellent. It models a complex scenario, is well-phrased, correctly formatted, and yields a single numerical solution. It outstandingly "Forces Multi-Step Reasoning" by requiring the student to first calculate the relativistic velocity of the electron from its kinetic energy, and then use that velocity in the Cherenkov angle formula. This combines two distinct advanced physics concepts.
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    1.  **Uniqueness:** Similar to Q3, while the problem is conceptually strong, the scenario is a classic application. For higher uniqueness, consider a scenario where the refractive index depends on wavelength, or derive the kinetic energy from a particle accelerator context. But as is, it's a solid question.

---

**Question 5: Luminous Flux and Luminous Efficacy**

*   **Critique:** This question clearly models a scenario, is well-phrased, correctly formatted, and yields a single numerical solution. However, it's primarily a direct application of the definition of luminous flux based on radiometric power and luminous efficacy ($\Phi_v = K_m \cdot V(\lambda) \cdot P$). It lacks significant "Multi-Step Reasoning" or "Uniqueness."
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    1.  **Multi-Step Reasoning:** To improve, require students to calculate the radiometric power ($P$) from a given number of photons per second, or from the radiant intensity of a source at a certain distance and area. Or, introduce a scenario where the efficiency of power conversion is given, requiring a step to find the radiometric power first.
    2.  **Uniqueness:** This is a very basic definition application. Consider integrating it with a different aspect of light interaction or emission.

---

**Question 6: Photoelectric Effect**

*   **Critique:** This question is strong. It models a scenario, is concisely phrased, uses correct units and formatting, and yields a single numerical solution. It effectively "Forces Multi-Step Reasoning" by requiring the conversion of wavelength to photon energy ($E=hc/\lambda$) before applying the photoelectric effect equation ($K_{max} = E_{photon} - \phi$).
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    1.  **Uniqueness:** While well-constructed, the photoelectric effect problem is a staple. To make it more unique, consider asking for the threshold wavelength given the work function and a specific stopping voltage, or involve a situation where the intensity of light affects the photocurrent, requiring a conceptual understanding beyond just energy calculation.

---

**Question 7: Relativistic Doppler Effect (Frequency)**

*   **Critique:** This question is very similar to Question 1, differing only in asking for frequency instead of wavelength and the direction of motion. This significantly violates the "Be Unique" guideline. Like Q1, it's a direct application of the relativistic Doppler formula, thus lacking "Multi-Step Reasoning."
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    1.  **Remove or Rework:** Given its similarity to Q1, one of them should be removed or drastically re-conceptualized.
    2.  **Multi-Step Reasoning:** If kept, similar to Q1, integrate it with calculating the velocity from a different principle (e.g., relativistic momentum or energy), or ask for the *energy* of the observed photons, requiring an additional Planck's relation step.
    3.  **Uniqueness:** As a standalone, this is a standard textbook problem.

---

**Question 8: Blackbody Radiation (Luminosity)**

*   **Critique:** This question is strong. It effectively models a scenario, is concisely phrased, uses correct units and formatting, and yields a single numerical solution. It successfully "Forces Multi-Step Reasoning" by requiring the calculation of the sphere's surface area ($A = 4\pi r^2$) before applying the Stefan-Boltzmann law ($L = A \sigma T^4$).
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    1.  **Uniqueness:** Blackbody radiation is a standard topic. To make it more unique, consider a non-spherical object, or a scenario involving heat exchange with surroundings, or finding the equilibrium temperature when absorbing radiation from another source. However, for a direct test of the Stefan-Boltzmann law with area, it is effective.

---

**Summary of Overall Improvements Needed:**

*   **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Questions 1, 2, 5, and 7 need to be revised to genuinely incorporate two or more distinct physical principles or calculation steps, rather than direct formula application.
*   **Uniqueness:** Most questions are standard textbook examples. While some are well-crafted within that context (like Q3, Q4, Q6, Q8), they could benefit from more novel scenarios or combinations of concepts to truly stand out. Q1 and Q7 are particularly redundant and one should be removed or fundamentally changed.

Here's a critique of the provided physics questions based on your guidelines, with concise, actionable feedback for improvement:

**General Feedback:**
The questions are generally well-phrased, grammatically correct, and use appropriate conventional notation and units. They all require multi-step reasoning and target a single numerical answer. The formatting, including LaTeX and Markdown, is correct.

However, a significant area for improvement lies in **Guideline 5: Be Unique**. Many of these questions are very standard, almost verbatim textbook problems. While they fulfill the "multi-step" requirement, the *scenario* itself often lacks novelty, which might limit their effectiveness in truly assessing deeper conceptual understanding beyond rote application of formulas.
