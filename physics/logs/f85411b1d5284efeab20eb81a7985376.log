<question>Consider a composite Higgs model in which the Higgs boson arises as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of a global symmetry spontaneously broken at scale $f$. Assuming that the Higgs coupling deviation to vector bosons is parameterized by $\kappa_V = \sqrt{1 - \xi}$, where $\xi = v^2/f^2$ and $v$ is the electroweak vacuum expectation value, derive a symbolic expression for the shift in the Higgs coupling to fermions, $\kappa_f$, when a Next-to-Leading Order nonlinear term proportional to $\alpha \, \xi^2$ modifies the original linear coupling. Express $\kappa_f$ in terms of $\xi$ and $\alpha$ under the assumption that deviations remain perturbative.</question>

<question>Within the Relaxion mechanism framework, the Higgs mass parameter $\mu^2(\phi) = \Lambda^2 - g \Lambda \phi$ evolves with the classical relaxion field $\phi$. Given a backreaction potential $V_\text{br}(\phi) = \Lambda_\text{br}^4 \cos(\phi/f)$ that halts the relaxion at a critical point $\phi_c$, derive an expression for the final Higgs mass squared $m_H^2$ after relaxation in terms of $g, \Lambda, \Lambda_\text{br}, f$, and the phases of the potential at $\phi_c$, assuming that $\phi_c$ is fixed by $|\frac{dV}{d\phi}|=0$ combined from the linear slope and the backreaction oscillation.</question>

<question>In a scenario exhibiting UV/IR mixing, the effective field theory cutoff $\Lambda_{\text{eff}}$ acquires an energy dependence governed by a non-local operator $O_{\text{mix}} \propto \Lambda_{\text{UV}}^{-1} p^2$, where $p$ is the IR momentum scale and $\Lambda_{\text{UV}}$ is the ultraviolet cutoff. Assuming that the mixing modifies the Higgs self-coupling $\lambda$ at scale $p$ as $\lambda_{\text{eff}}(p) = \lambda_0 \left(1 + \beta \frac{p^2}{\Lambda_{\text{UV}}^2}\right)$, derive the symbolic expression for the correction $\Delta m_H^2$ to the Higgs mass squared induced by this effective coupling at low momentum $p$, given $\lambda_0$, $\beta$, $p$, and the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$.</question>

<question>For a neutral naturalness model in which the top partner is a color-neutral fermion $T'$ coupling to the Higgs with Yukawa $y_{T'}$, and assuming the Higgs potential $V(h) = -\mu^2 h^2 + \lambda h^4 + \delta V(h)$ receives loop corrections $\delta V(h) \approx \frac{N_c y_{t'}^4}{16 \pi^2} h^4 \log\left(\frac{M^2}{m_{t'}^2(h)}\right)$ where $m_{t'}(h)= y_{t'} h$, derive an expression for the shift in the quartic coupling $\Delta \lambda$ induced by the top partner loop in terms of $y_{t'}$, $N_c$, the renormalization scale $M$, and the Higgs field $h$ evaluated at the electroweak scale $v$.</question>

<question>Assuming the cosmological constant problem is addressed by a mechanism in which vacuum energy density $\rho_\Lambda(\Lambda_{\text{UV}})$ scales as a function of the UV cutoff $\Lambda_{\text{UV}}$ and IR scale $\Lambda_{\text{IR}}$ via a UV/IR mixing relation $\rho_\Lambda = \alpha \Lambda_{\text{UV}}^4 \left( \frac{\Lambda_{\text{IR}}}{\Lambda_{\text{UV}}} \right)^{\gamma}$, where $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ are positive constants, derive the symbolic expression for the effective cosmological constant $\Lambda_{\text{eff}}$ as a function of $\alpha$, $\gamma$, $\Lambda_{\text{UV}}$, and $\Lambda_{\text{IR}}$, assuming $\Lambda_{\text{eff}}^4 = \rho_\Lambda$.</question>

<question>In a composite Higgs model with partial compositeness, the top Yukawa $y_t$ arises from mixing of elementary top quarks with composite resonances of mass $M$ and coupling strength $g_\ast$. Given that $y_t \approx \frac{g_\ast \lambda_L \lambda_R}{M}$, where $\lambda_{L,R}$ are the linear mixings of left- and right-handed top quark components with the composite sector, derive an expression for the correction $\delta \kappa_t$ to the top Yukawa coupling normalized to its Standard Model value in terms of $v$, $f$, $g_\ast$, $\lambda_L$, $\lambda_R$, and $M$, assuming $v/f \ll 1$ and linear order corrections in $v/f$.</question>
=== Turn 0: Critic feedback ===
Certainly! Here is a detailed, guideline-by-guideline critique for each of your questions, as an assessment expert.

---

### 1. **Composite Higgs coupling deviation ($\kappa_f$) with NLO term**

**Strengths:**
- **Physical Scenario:** Clear, relevant to BSM Higgs physics.
- **Clear target:** Symbolic expression for $\kappa_f$.
- **Multi-step reasoning required.**
- **Not a textbook rephrase; unique.**
- **Consistent units, standard symbols.**

**Improvements:**
- *Assumptions:* States "when a Next-to-Leading Order nonlinear term proportional to $\alpha \xi^2$ modifies the original linear coupling"—could clarify if this is an additive or a multiplicative correction, or specify the structure of the modification explicitly to avoid ambiguity.
- *Output:* Specify required format more strictly, e.g., "Express your answer in a single symbolic LaTeX equation."
- *Extraneous details:* Use only variables required for the final answer.

**Actionable suggestion:**  
> Clarify whether the $\alpha \xi^2$ term adds to or multiplies the leading coupling, and specify all variables appearing in the answer.

---

### 2. **Relaxion mechanism, final $m_H^2$ after stopping**

**Strengths:**
- **Unique, advanced scenario.**
- **Clear physical setup and variable.**
- **Requires reasoning combining several physical steps.**
- **Units and notation are appropriate.**

**Improvements:**
- *Ambiguity in "phases at $\phi_c$":* Unclear what “the phases of the potential at $\phi_c$” refers to. Should be specified more precisely (e.g., is it the value of $\phi_c$, or something else?).
- *Redundancy:* Full restatement of $|\frac{dV}{d\phi}|=0$ may be unnecessary if already implied by the setup.
- *Assumptions required:* "Assume $\phi_c$ is fixed by..." is fine, but phrase in a way that indicates it's a logical consequence rather than an assumption to be made by the student.

**Actionable suggestion:**  
> Specify the definition of “the phases of the potential at $\phi_c$” or eliminate this ambiguity. Frame the halting condition strictly as part of the model, not as a student assumption.

---

### 3. **UV/IR Mixing, Higgs Mass Correction**

**Strengths:**
- **Novel, physics-rich context (UV/IR mixing).**
- **Requires multi-step evaluation (effective coupling → mass correction).**
- **Single target quantity.**
- **Proper formatting guidance.**

**Improvements:**
- *Redundancy/variables:* $\Lambda_{\text{eff}}$ mentioned in the scenario, but not required for the answer—omit unless it is part of the target calculation.
- *Clarity:* Clarify at the outset that $p$ is the IR momentum *scale* relevant for the correction.
- *Assumptions:* If only leading order in $p^2/\Lambda_\text{UV}^2$ is required, state this directly.

**Actionable suggestion:**  
> Remove mention of $\Lambda_{\text{eff}}$ unless it's essential for the answer. Explicitly specify that terms beyond leading order in $p^2/\Lambda_\text{UV}^2$ can be neglected.

---

### 4. **Neutral naturalness: top partner loop effect**

**Strengths:**
- **Physical, current model scenario.**
- **Requires deriving the shift in quartic coupling from loop corrections.**
- **Clear output variable.**
- **Consistent units and notation.**

**Improvements:**
- *Variable overload:* Both $h$ and $v$ mentioned for evaluation point—uniformly specify that the answer is to be given at $h = v$; else, risk ambiguity in evaluation.
- *Minor redundancy:* "Assume Higgs field $h$ evaluated at electroweak scale $v$" could be phrased more crisply.

**Actionable suggestion:**  
> Specify "Evaluate $\Delta\lambda$ at $h = v$," and state that $M$ is a generic renormalization scale (or clarify its meaning if not standard).

---

### 5. **Cosmological constant problem with UV/IR mixing**

**Strengths:**
- **Original, physically interesting context.**
- **Clear, single symbolic target ($\Lambda_\text{eff}$).**
- **Consistent notation and variables.**
- **Multi-step reasoning (connect scaling with definition).**

**Improvements:**
- *Redundancy:* Both $\rho_\Lambda$ and $\Lambda_\text{eff}$ are defined/related, could be phrased more directly.
- *Assumptions:* "Assuming $\Lambda_{\text{eff}}^4 = \rho_\Lambda$" could be simply stated or incorporated into the scenario.

**Actionable suggestion:**  
> Eliminate the "Assuming..." parenthetical and state directly in the question’s premise that $\Lambda_{\text{eff}}^4 \equiv \rho_\Lambda$.

---

### 6. **Composite Higgs partial compositeness, $\delta\kappa_t$**

**Strengths:**
- **Interesting, advanced scenario.**
- **Clear symbolic target ($\delta\kappa_t$) with proper normalization.**
- **Requires chaining several relations.**
- **Consistent and standard notation.**

**Improvements:**
- *Assumptions about corrections:* "Assume $v/f\ll 1$ and linear order corrections"—should specify these are to be retained to first order in $v/f$ (clarify that higher-order terms are neglected).
- *Variable list:* Only introduce variables appearing in the answer—if $y_t$ cancels in the normalization, don’t include unless needed.
- *Minor wording:* Rather than “derive an expression for the correction,” ask for “the linear-order correction…” for laser focus.

**Actionable suggestion:**  
> Frame as "derive a linear-order expression for $\delta\kappa_t$ in $v/f$," and clarify that all other variables should appear only if relevant for that result.

---

## **General Points**

- All questions are novel, complex, and multi-step.  
- All target a symbolic, single-answer expression and require a sequence of theoretical manipulations.  
- Some ambiguity remains (esp. regarding assumptions or evaluation points).  
- All are excellently phrased for advanced physics, but could benefit from a tighter focus on variable scope and precision of what is assumed by the student.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Q# | Key Issue(s) | Concise Fix |
|----|--------------|-------------|
| 1  | Ambiguous correction form; variable overuse | Specify how $\alpha\xi^2$ modifies $\kappa_f$; remove unused variables |
| 2  | "Phases at $\phi_c$" is ill-defined | Explicitly define or remove; state potential's stopping condition as input |
| 3  | Unused variable ($\Lambda_{\text{eff}}$); higher-order terms | Remove mention; state to keep leading order only |
| 4  | Ambiguity in field at evaluation | Specify $h = v$ evaluation clearly |
| 5  | Redundant “Assume…” phrasing | State defining relation in scenario setup |
| 6  | Clarify linear approximation and variable inclusion | Explicitly ask for linear-order in $v/f$ only; avoid extraneous variables |

---

## **Quick Recap of Guidelines Adherence**

- All below pass #1, #2, #4, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12.
- All can improve on #3 (output-format: specify explicitly in each question) and minor clarifications on assumptions/scope.

**Overall:**  
Your questions are highly original, demanding, and mostly tightly written. Polish by (a) specifying exactly how corrections/terms modify original couplings, (b) stating explicitly which terms/order to keep, (c) removing extraneous variables or phrasing, and (d) stating evaluation points or variable values precisely within the question.

Consider a composite Higgs model where the Higgs boson arises as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of a global symmetry spontaneously broken at scale \( f \), with electroweak vacuum expectation value \( v \). The deviation in the Higgs coupling to vector bosons is parameterized by \(\kappa_V = \sqrt{1 - \xi}\), where \(\xi = \frac{v^2}{f^2}\). Suppose the Higgs coupling to fermions receives a Next-to-Leading Order additive correction proportional to \(\alpha \, \xi^2\) such that

</question>

<question>
Within the Relaxion mechanism framework, the Higgs mass parameter depends on the classical relaxion field \(\phi\) as \(\mu^2(\phi) = \Lambda^2 - g \Lambda \phi\). The relaxion potential includes a backreaction term:
\[
V_\mathrm{br}(\phi) = \Lambda_\mathrm{br}^4 \cos\left(\frac{\phi}{f}\right).
\]
The relaxion stops rolling at a critical point \(\phi_c\) where the slope of the total potential vanishes:
\[
\left.\frac{dV}{d\phi}\right|_{\phi_c} = -g \Lambda + \frac{\Lambda_\mathrm{br}^4}{f} \sin\left(\frac{\phi_c}{f}\right) = 0.
\]

=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here’s a critique for each question, referencing the provided guidelines and suggesting concrete improvements:

---

### Question 1
**Strengths:**
- Models a composite Higgs scenario rooted in actual BSM physics.
- Asks for a single symbolic expression as the answer.
- Requires multi-step reasoning (expansion, grouping terms).

**Areas for improvement:**
- The question is well-posed. There are no redundant variables, and essential information is given.
- Suggest adding a note explicitly stating, “Expand $\sqrt{1-\xi}$ in powers of $\xi$ up to order $\xi^2$,” to clarify the need for a Taylor expansion (remove ambiguity).
- Avoid terms like "simplified symbolic expression"—be precise: "Expand and express $\kappa_f$ in terms of $\xi$ and $\alpha$, up to and including order $\xi^2$."

---

### Question 2
**Strengths:**
- Realistic setup (Relaxion, Higgs mass parameter).
- Directs for a single symbolic output.
- Forces multistep reasoning (critical point, substitution).

**Areas for improvement:**
- Asking for an expression in terms of $\sin(\phi_c/f)$ when this variable is related to other parameters in the equation, but not fully fixed, may leave ambiguity for students: is the answer expected to substitute for $\sin(\phi_c/f)$ or leave it as is?
- State clearly if $\sin(\phi_c/f)$ should remain as is or if it should be written in terms of other variables using the extremum condition.
- Minor: The phrase “the relaxion stops rolling at a critical point $\phi_c$ where the slope of the total potential vanishes” is fine, but could be more rigorously phrased, e.g., “at the field value $\phi_c$ such that $dV/d\phi|_{\phi_c} = 0$.”

---

### Question 3
**Strengths:**
- Clear scenario with effective coupling, impacts at given IR momentum.
- Answer unambiguously requests a symbolic correction expression.
- Requires chaining physical reasoning (effective coupling → mass shift).

**Areas for improvement:**
- The physics of “leading order correction $\Delta m_H^2$” is not fully specified: does this refer to the tree-level Higgs mass term or to a loop correction induced by the change in coupling? If the question expects $m_H^2 = 2\lambda_{\text{eff}}(p)v^2$, make this explicit. If instead the loop correction is sought, that should be clarified.
- Avoid possible confusion: define explicitly how $\lambda_{\rm eff}(p)$ enters the Higgs mass (e.g., “Assume $m_H^2 = 2\lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}(p) v^2$”). This prevents the need for unstated assumptions (guideline 12).
- Otherwise, structure is good: no extraneous variables.

---

### Question 4
**Strengths:**
- Innovative, non-standard (not a textbook problem).
- Expects an explicit, single symbolic expression.
- Requires interpretation/identification of terms in the potential, differentiation, and identification of quartic coefficient.

**Areas for improvement:**
- The logarithm argument $\log(M^2/m_{t'}^2(h))$ with $m_{t'}(h) = y_{t'} h$ becomes $\log(M^2 / y_{t'}^2 h^2)$; at $h = v$, maybe clarify that $M$ is a fixed scale (renormalization point) and $v$ is the physical Higgs VEV.
- Make explicit: “Extract the coefficient of $h^4$ in $\delta V(h)$ to obtain $\Delta\lambda$ at $h = v$."
- Otherwise, question is concise, clear, and unambiguous.

---

### Question 5
**Strengths:**
- Creative scaling relation for vacuum energy; not a textbook repetition.
- Simple and direct output requested.
- Clear variable definitions.

**Areas for improvement:**
- The only minor critique is to state units explicitly (“All mass scales are expressed in energy units”), but the use of $^4$ makes this mostly clear.
- To be fully rigorous and avoid future confusion, include: “All symbols represent positive real numbers.”

---

### Question 6
**Strengths:**
- Realistic scenario for composite Higgs with partial compositeness.
- Expressly asks for a linear-order (in $v/f$) correction.

**Areas for improvement:**
- While variables are well defined, it may help to clarify: “Assume only $v \ll f$ and keep only terms linear in $v/f$.”
- It might be better to guide students: “Express $\delta \kappa_t$ in terms of the leading term in $v/f$ using the given relationships.”
- Ensure that $y_t$ is the Standard Model value for normalization—minor, but worth making explicit.

---

#### General Feedback/Improvements

- **Ambiguity**: Occasionally, it's unclear exactly which formulation is desired (as in Q2 and Q3 re: variable substitutability and interpretation of “correction”).
- **Explicit Instructions**: Add clarifying statements where variables may or may not be substituted or where formulas should be expanded.
- **Conciseness**: All questions are concise, but in some, a clarifying sentence would further increase rigor and reduce ambiguity.
- **Single Output**: All questions only require a single output—adheres to construction guidelines.
- **Non-redundancy**: No question contains extraneous details or distracting variables.
- **Originality**: All questions are uniquely tied to current BSM and theoretical physics literature, not textbook formulas.
- **Consistent Units**: All symbols used have consistent implied units, but Q5 could specify explicitly.
- **Standard Notation**: All variables are defined and well-annotated.

---

### Example Improvements

**For Q2:**
> Using the criticality condition, substitute for $\sin(\phi_c/f)$ or leave your answer in terms of it, as appropriate. Clearly state if your final expression should have only $g, \Lambda, \Lambda_{\mathrm{br}}, f$ (i.e., eliminate $\phi_c$), or if leaving $\sin(\phi_c/f)$ explicit is permitted.

---

**For Q3:**
> To remove ambiguity, specify: “Assume that $m_H^2 = 2\, \lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}(p)\, v^2$. Derive the leading correction $\Delta m_H^2$ (the change in the Higgs mass squared relative to $\lambda_0$) at $p\ll \Lambda_{\mathrm{UV}}$.”

## Actionable Summary

- All questions are intricate, original, and nearly perfect in their construction.
- For absolute rigor: **clarify where variables can be eliminated in favor of other parameters** (Q2), and **explicitly define masses/corrections in terms of model relations** (Q3, Q4).
- If a Taylor expansion or similar operation is required, **explicitly ask for it** rather than use ambiguous language like “simplified symbolic expression.”
- (Optional) In scaling problems (Q5), **explicitly note units and domain of variables** to preclude future confusion.

**Overall:** These are strong, effective advanced physics assessment items. Addressing the minor clarity issues above will make them exemplary.

Consider a composite Higgs model where the Higgs boson arises as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of a global symmetry spontaneously broken at scale \( f \), with electroweak vacuum expectation value \( v \). The deviation in the Higgs coupling to vector bosons is parameterized by \(\kappa_V = \sqrt{1 - \xi}\), where \(\xi = \frac{v^2}{f^2}\).

Within the Relaxion mechanism framework, the Higgs mass parameter depends on the classical relaxion field \(\phi\) as

=== Turn 2: Critic feedback ===
Here is a critique of each question against your provided guidelines:

---

### Question 1: Composite Higgs Expansion

**Strengths:**
- **Physical scenario is clearly laid out:** Composite Higgs, pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone.
- **Solvable quantity:** Expand $\sqrt{1-\xi}$, then write explicit $\kappa_f$.
- **Multi-step reasoning is required:** Taylor expansion + substitution.
- **Unique, non-standard context.**
- **Output is a single symbolic expression in LaTeX.**

**Weaknesses:**
- **Redundancy:** The question introduces $v$ unnecessarily—$\xi$ is already defined in terms of $v$ and $f$; these do not directly appear in the final expansion.
- **Clarity:** "Write $\kappa_f$ explicitly as a single equation..."—this could be more direct: “Express $\kappa_f$ in terms of $\xi$ and $\alpha$ up to ${\cal O}(\xi^2)$.”

**Actionable Improvements:**
- Omit mention of $v$ and $f$ unless needed in the final expression.
- Phrase the request with “Express $\kappa_f$ in terms of $\xi$ and $\alpha$, retaining terms up to order $\xi^2$.”

---

### Question 2: Relaxion Higgs Mass

**Strengths:**
- **Clear model and physical context (relaxion mechanism).**
- **Solvable quantity:** $m_H^2$.
- **Output is a single LaTeX equation.**
- **Requires multi-step reasoning and symbolic manipulation.**

**Weaknesses:**
- **Minor redundancy:** Variable $v$ is referenced as “electroweak scale” but not used; also, the option of leaving $\sin(\phi_c/f)$ explicit or not is ambiguous, leading to the potential for multiple form-equivalent answers.
- **Ambiguity:** “You may leave $\sin(\phi_c/f)$ explicit or eliminate...” Encourages multiple possible valid expressions.

**Actionable Improvements:**
- Require that the answer either express everything in terms of $\sin(\phi_c/f)$ **or** use the criticality condition to eliminate it. Don’t allow both.
- Be direct: “Express $m_H^2$ in terms of $g, \Lambda, \Lambda_{\mathrm{br}}, f$ only, eliminating $\phi_c$ using the criticality condition.”

---

### Question 3: UV/IR Mixing Correction

**Strengths:**
- **Clear, non-textbook physical setup (UV/IR mixing).**
- **Solvable: asks for $\Delta m_H^2$ as a symbolic/leading-order result.**
- **Proper output format.**
- **Requires substitution, identification of correction term, and power counting.**
- **Not redundant, and all variables are needed.**

**Weaknesses:**
- **Minor:** The phrase “retaining terms only up to order $p^2/\Lambda_{\mathrm{UV}}^2$” could be misread as including higher order terms, but mathematically is correct.

**Actionable Improvements:**
- Slightly tighten: “Expand and retain terms linear in $p^2/\Lambda_{\mathrm{UV}}^2$.”

---

### Question 4: Color-Neutral Top Partner Quartic Shift

**Strengths:**
- **Original context, not a standard textbook scenario.**
- **Targets a unique, well-defined quantity ($\Delta\lambda$).**
- **Multi-step reasoning required (potential evaluation, coefficient extraction).**
- **Output: single symbolic, LaTeX equation.**

**Weaknesses:**
- **Minor:** The phrase “Evaluate this expression at the electroweak scale $h = v$” is unnecessary—since one is extracting the $h^4$ coefficient, $h$ can be left as a symbol.
- **Unneeded variable:** $v$ is introduced, but is not relevant to the $h^4$ coefficient itself.

**Actionable Improvements:**
- Remove "evaluate at $h = v$" and avoid introducing $v$ as a final variable if not used.

---

### Question 5: Cosmological Constant Scaling

**Strengths:**
- **Unique scenario, non-standard scaling law.**
- **Targets a physical expression ($\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}$) in terms of defined constants.**
- **Requires algebraic manipulation and consistent units.**
- **Only variables needed are introduced.**
- **Output format is correct.**

**Weaknesses:**
- **None.**

**Actionable Improvements:**
- None needed.

---

### Question 6: Composite Higgs Top Yukawa Correction

**Strengths:**
- **Unique, highly relevant modern physics context.**
- **Asks for an explicit correction $\delta\kappa_t$ to a coupling, normalized to the SM.**
- **Requires algebraic reasoning using operator mixing phenomenology, includes multi-step manipulation.**
- **Variables all appear to be necessary.**
- **Output asks for a single symbolic expression, correct formatting.**

**Weaknesses:**
- **Minor:** Reminds about $v/f\ll1$, but expects only linear terms—could be made more explicit: “Expand and retain only linear terms in $v/f$.”

**Actionable Improvements:**
- Replace “keeping only terms linear in $v/f$” with “Retain only terms linear in $v/f$.”

## **General Actionable Feedback**

- **Avoid introducing variables (like $v$ or $f$) that do not appear in the final symbolic result.**
- **Require the answer to be given in a single canonical symbolic form. Do not offer “leave as X or Y.”**
- **Phrase order-of-expansion directives concisely and mathematically, e.g., “Retain terms linear in $x$.”**
- **Remove references to evaluating at a particular field value unless it strictly changes the result.**
- **Check that all and only those variables required for the solution are defined and appear in the answer.**
- **Conform strictly to a single equation output and avoid ambiguities or multiple paths in the solution.**
- **Use concise phrasing throughout, as you mostly do.**

Overall: The questions are strong, unique, and challenging, but could be made even clearer and closer to your high standards with these targeted refinements.

Consider a composite Higgs model where the Higgs boson arises as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken global symmetry. The deviation in the Higgs coupling to vector bosons is parameterized by \(\kappa_V = \sqrt{1 - \xi}\), where \(\xi\) is a small parameter. The Higgs coupling to fermions receives a next-to-leading order additive correction proportional to \(\alpha \, \xi^2\), so that
\[
\kappa_f = \sqrt{1 - \xi} + \alpha \, \xi^{2}.
\]
Expand \(\sqrt{1-\xi}\) in powers of \(\xi\) up to and including order \(\xi^{2}\), and then express \(\kappa_f\) explicitly as a single equation in terms of \(\xi\) and \(\alpha\), retaining terms only up to order \(\xi^{2}\).
</question>

<question>
Within the Relaxion mechanism, the Higgs mass parameter depends on the relaxion field \(\phi\) as
\[
\mu^2(\phi) = \Lambda^2 - g \Lambda \phi,
\]
and the backreaction potential is
\[
V_{\mathrm{br}}(\phi) = \Lambda_{\mathrm{br}}^{4} \cos\left(\frac{\phi}{f}\right).
\]
The relaxion stops rolling at \(\phi = \phi_c\) where the total potential slope vanishes:
\[
\left.\frac{dV}{d\phi}\right|_{\phi_c} = -g \Lambda + \frac{\Lambda_{\mathrm{br}}^{4}}{f} \sin\left(\frac{\phi_c}{f}\right) = 0.
\]
Using this condition to eliminate \(\sin(\phi_c/f)\), express the final Higgs mass squared
\[
m_H^{2} = \mu^{2}(\phi_c)
\]
explicitly as a single equation in terms of \(g\), \(\Lambda\), \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{br}}\), and \(f\) only.

<question>
In a scenario with UV/IR mixing, the Higgs self-coupling at IR momentum scale \(p \ll \Lambda_{\mathrm{UV}}\) is modified as
\[
\lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}(p) = \lambda_0 \left( 1 + \beta \frac{p^{2}}{\Lambda_{\mathrm{UV}}^{2}} \right),
\]
where \(\lambda_0\), \(\beta\), and \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{UV}}\) are positive constants. The Higgs mass squared at scale \(p\) is given by
\[
m_H^{2}(p) = 2 \lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}(p) v^{2},
\]
where \(v\) is the Higgs vacuum expectation value. Derive the leading-order correction \(\Delta m_H^{2}\) to the Higgs mass squared induced by the effective coupling at scale \(p\), retaining terms linear in \(p^2/\Lambda_{\mathrm{UV}}^2\), and present your answer as a single symbolic equation in terms of \(\lambda_0\), \(\beta\), \(p\), \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{UV}}\), and \(v\).

<question>
In a neutral naturalness model with a color-neutral top partner fermion \(t'\) coupling to the Higgs via Yukawa coupling \(y_{t'}\), the Higgs potential receives loop corrections of the form
\[
\delta V(h) \approx \frac{N_c y_{t'}^{4}}{16 \pi^{2}} \, h^{4} \log\left(\frac{M^{2}}{m^{2}_{t'}(h)}\right),
\]
where \(N_c\) is the number of colors, \(M\) is the renormalization scale, and \(m_{t'}(h) = y_{t'} h\). Extract the induced shift \(\Delta \lambda\) in the Higgs quartic coupling by identifying the coefficient of \(h^{4}\), and express \(\Delta \lambda\) symbolically as a single LaTeX equation in terms of \(y_{t'}\), \(N_c\), and \(M\).
</question>

<question>
Assuming the cosmological constant problem is addressed by a mechanism where the vacuum energy density scales as
\[
\rho_{\Lambda} = \alpha \, \Lambda_{\mathrm{UV}}^{4} \left(\frac{\Lambda_{\mathrm{IR}}}{\Lambda_{\mathrm{UV}}}\right)^{\gamma},
\]
with positive constants \(\alpha > 0\) and \(\gamma > 0\), and defining the effective cosmological constant \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}\) via
\[
\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}^{4} = \rho_{\Lambda},
\]
derive an explicit symbolic expression for \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}\) as a positive real function of \(\alpha\), \(\gamma\), \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{UV}}\), and \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{IR}}\). Present your answer as a single equation.
</question>

<question>
In a composite Higgs model with partial compositeness, the top Yukawa coupling arises from mixing of elementary tops with composite resonances of mass \(M\) and strong coupling \(g_{\ast}\), as
\[
y_t \approx \frac{g_{\ast} \lambda_L \lambda_R}{M},
\]
where \(\lambda_L\) and \(\lambda_R\) are the left- and right-handed linear mixing parameters. Assuming \(v/f \ll 1\), derive the linear-order correction \(\delta \kappa_t\) to the normalized top Yukawa coupling,
\[
\kappa_t = 1 + \delta \kappa_t,
\]
retaining only terms linear in \(v/f\). Express \(\delta \kappa_t\) as a single equation in terms of \(v\), \(f\), \(g_{\ast}\), \(\lambda_L\), \(\lambda_R\), and \(M\).
