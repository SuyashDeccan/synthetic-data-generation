A monolayer of 1T′-MoTe₂ exhibits interband nesting between electron and hole pockets, leading to a charge density wave (CDW) instability. Assume the electron and hole pockets are perfectly circular with radii $k_e$ and $k_h$ respectively, and centered at points separated by a wavevector $\mathbf{Q}$. The Fermi velocities at the electron and hole pockets are $v_e$ and $v_h$ respectively. Assuming perfect nesting (i.e., the Fermi surfaces align when shifted by $\mathbf{Q}$), calculate the magnitude of the CDW gap, $\Delta$, at $T=0$ in terms of the coupling constant $g$ between the electron and hole pockets and the density of states at the Fermi level, $N(0)$, for a single spin.

Consider a heterostructure consisting of a thin film of a topological material with a unidirectional charge order (CO) placed in proximity to a conventional s-wave superconductor. Assume that interfacial disorder introduces scattering between the Cooper pairs in the superconductor and the CO fluctuations in the topological material. The CO fluctuation amplitude is characterized by a coherence length $\xi_{CO}$ and a typical fluctuation energy scale $\Omega_{CO}$. If the superconducting coherence length is $\xi_{SC}$, and the average spacing between scattering centers at the interface is $l$, and the superconducting gap is given as $\Delta_{SC}$, derive an expression for the critical temperature $T_c$ for superconductivity, assuming $T_c$ is suppressed by the interfacial disorder.

Use the Abrikosov-Gor'kov relation $T_c = T_{c0} - \frac{\hbar \Gamma}{2 \pi k_B}$, where $T_{c0}$ is the critical temperature in the absence of scattering and $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant.

A quasi-one-dimensional material exhibits a strong interplay between electron correlation and topology, resulting in the emergence of a pair-density-wave (PDW) state. Suppose the dispersion relation for the electrons is given by $\epsilon(k) = -2t \cos(ka)$, where $t$ is the hopping parameter and $a$ is the lattice constant. Due to strong correlations, a Hubbard interaction $U$ is present. In the PDW state, Cooper pairs condense with a finite center-of-mass momentum $Q$. Assume that the PDW order parameter is given by $\Delta_{PDW}$. Calculate the energy gap at the Fermi level, $E_g$, induced by the PDW order. Assume that $Q=\pi/a$ and the pairing occurs between electrons with momenta $k$ and $-k + Q$. Use the mean-field Hamiltonian $H_{MF} = \sum_k \epsilon(k) c_{k}^\dagger c_k + \Delta_{PDW} c_{k}^\dagger c_{-k+Q}^\dagger + \Delta_{PDW}^* c_{-k+Q} c_{k}$, and find the eigenvalues of the Bogoliubov–de Gennes equation.

**Question 1 Critique:**

```
A monolayer of 1T′-MoTe₂ exhibits interband nesting between electron and hole pockets, leading to a charge density wave (CDW) instability. Assume the electron and hole pockets are perfectly circular with radii $k_e$ and $k_h$ respectively, and centered at points separated by a wavevector $\mathbf{Q}$. The Fermi velocities at the electron and hole pockets are $v_e$ and $v_h$ respectively. Assuming perfect nesting (i.e., the Fermi surfaces align when shifted by $\mathbf{Q}$), calculate the magnitude of the CDW gap, $\Delta$, at $T=0$ in terms of the coupling constant $g$ between the electron and hole pockets and the density of states at the Fermi level, $N(0)$, for a single spin. Assume a weak coupling BCS-like relation where $\Delta = 2\omega_c e^{-1/gN(0)}$, where $\omega_c$ is a cutoff energy scale determined by the electronic bandwidth, $W$. Express your answer for $\Delta$ in terms of $W$ and $gN(0)$.
```

*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** **Excellent.** Describes a specific material and a real physical phenomenon (CDW instability due to interband nesting), providing a good idealized setup.
*   **2. Expect answers as symbolic expression:** **Excellent.** Clearly asks for a symbolic expression.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** **Weak.** The question directly provides the weak coupling BCS-like relation: $\Delta = 2\omega_c e^{-1/gN(0)}$. The only "step" required is to substitute $\omega_c = W$ (as implied by "determined by the electronic bandwidth, $W$"). This is a single, trivial substitution, not multi-step reasoning. All the detailed information about circular pockets, radii, Fermi velocities, and perfect nesting is ultimately irrelevant to the calculation *given the provided formula*.
*   **5. Be Unique:** **Moderate.** While the material context is specific, the core problem-solving step is a direct application of a given formula, which is not unique in terms of intellectual challenge.
*   **6. Single Solution:** **Excellent.** Will yield a single, unambiguous symbolic expression.
*   **7. Rigorous, concise phrasing:** **Excellent.** The language is professional and precise.
*   **9. Units must be consistent; symbols follow conventional physics notation:** **Excellent.** All symbols are standard, and units are implicitly consistent for a symbolic answer.
*   **10. Questions must not be multipart:** **Excellent.** Asks for a single target quantity.
*   **11. Question Formatting:** **Excellent.** Correct LaTeX and Markdown.

**Concise, actionable feedback:**
This question essentially gives away the solution. To improve it, **remove the explicit formula for $\Delta$**. Instead, require the student to either:
1.  Derive or recall the weak-coupling BCS-like gap equation from first principles, or
2.  Use the given information about electron and hole pockets, radii, and Fermi velocities to *calculate* the density of states $N(0)$ (if not explicitly given), and *then* apply a standard gap equation.
As written, the detailed description of the pockets and velocities is extraneous information.

<question>
Consider a heterostructure consisting of a thin film of a topological material with a unidirectional charge order (CO) placed in proximity to a conventional s-wave superconductor. Assume that interfacial disorder introduces scattering between the Cooper pairs in the superconductor and the CO fluctuations in the topological material. The CO fluctuation amplitude is characterized by a coherence length $\xi_{CO}$ and a typical fluctuation energy scale $\Omega_{CO}$. If the superconducting coherence length is $\xi_{SC}$, and the average spacing between scattering centers at the interface is $l$, and the superconducting gap is given as $\Delta_{SC}$, derive an expression for the critical temperature $T_c$ for superconductivity, assuming $T_c$ is suppressed by the interfacial disorder. Assume the de-pairing rate due to the scattering events is $\Gamma = (v_F/l) (\Omega_{CO}/\Delta_{SC})^2$, where $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity. Use the Abrikosov-Gor'kov relation $T_c = T_{c0} - \frac{\hbar \Gamma}{2 \pi k_B}$, where $T_{c0}$ is the critical temperature in the absence of scattering and $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant. Give your answer in terms of $T_{c0}$, $v_F$, $l$, $\Omega_{CO}$, $\Delta_{SC}$, $\hbar$, and $k_B$.
</question>
```

*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** **Excellent.** Presents a complex and relevant scenario involving heterostructures, proximity effects, and disorder.
*   **2. Expect answers as symbolic expression:** **Excellent.** Clearly asks for a symbolic expression.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** **Weak.** Similar to Q1, this question provides both the intermediate de-pairing rate $\Gamma$ and the final Abrikosov-Gor'kov relation. The task is a direct substitution of $\Gamma$ into the A-G formula. The phrase "derive an expression" is misleading; it's a simple algebraic substitution. The parameters $\xi_{CO}$ and $\xi_{SC}$ are provided but not used, acting as distractors.
*   **5. Be Unique:** **Moderate.** The physical setup is unique and cutting-edge. However, the problem-solving itself (direct substitution) is not.
*   **6. Single Solution:** **Excellent.** Will yield a single, unambiguous symbolic expression.
*   **7. Rigorous, concise phrasing:** **Excellent.** Clear and professional.
*   **9. Units must be consistent; symbols follow conventional physics notation:** **Excellent.** All symbols are standard, and units are implicitly consistent for a symbolic answer.
*   **10. Questions must not be multipart:** **Excellent.** Asks for a single target quantity.
*   **11. Question Formatting:** **Excellent.** Correct LaTeX and Markdown.

**Concise, actionable feedback:**
This question suffers from the same flaw as Q1: it spoon-feeds the critical intermediate step. To improve, **do not provide the explicit formula for $\Gamma$**. Instead, describe the scattering events in more fundamental terms (e.g., strength of interaction, number of scatterers, coherence lengths, energy scales) and require the student to formulate the de-pairing rate $\Gamma$ themselves before applying the Abrikosov-Gor'kov relation. Also, **remove irrelevant parameters** like $\xi_{CO}$ and $\xi_{SC}$ if they are not used.

A quasi-one-dimensional material exhibits a strong interplay between electron correlation and topology, resulting in the emergence of a pair-density-wave (PDW) state. Suppose the dispersion relation for the electrons is given by $\epsilon(k) = -2t \cos(ka)$, where $t$ is the hopping parameter and $a$ is the lattice constant. Due to strong correlations, a Hubbard interaction $U$ is present. In the PDW state, Cooper pairs condense with a finite center-of-mass momentum $Q$. Assume that the PDW order parameter is given by $\Delta_{PDW}$. Calculate the energy gap at the Fermi level, $E_g$, induced by the PDW order. Assume that $Q=\pi/a$ and the pairing occurs between electrons with momenta $k$ and $-k + Q$. Use the mean-field Hamiltonian $H_{MF} = \sum_k \epsilon(k) c_{k}^\dagger c_k + \Delta_{PDW} c_{k}^\dagger c_{-k+Q}^\dagger + \Delta_{PDW}^* c_{-k+Q} c_{k}$, and find the eigenvalues of the Bogoliubov–de Gennes equation. Express $E_g$ in terms of $\Delta_{PDW}$.

*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** **Excellent.** Describes a specific condensed matter system (1D material, PDW state) and its key properties.
*   **2. Expect answers as symbolic expression:** **Excellent.** Clearly asks for a symbolic expression.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** **Excellent.** This question genuinely requires multiple steps:
    1.  Setting up the BdG Hamiltonian in matrix form (identifying the basis, e.g., Nambu spinors).
    2.  Substituting the given dispersion $\epsilon(k)$ and $Q=\pi/a$.
    3.  Diagonalizing the $2 \times 2$ matrix to find the eigenvalues.
    4.  Interpreting the eigenvalues to determine the energy gap at the Fermi level.
*   **5. Be Unique:** **Excellent.** This is a specific, non-trivial application of the BdG formalism to a modern concept (PDW), making it distinct from standard textbook problems.
*   **6. Single Solution:** **Excellent.** Will yield a single, unambiguous symbolic expression.
*   **7. Rigorous, concise phrasing:** **Excellent.** The language is precise and appropriate for advanced learners.
*   **9. Units must be consistent; symbols follow conventional physics notation:** **Excellent.** All symbols are standard, and units are implicitly consistent for a symbolic answer.
*   **10. Questions must not be multipart:** **Excellent.** Asks for a single target quantity.
*   **11. Question Formatting:** **Excellent.** Correct LaTeX and Markdown.

**Concise, actionable feedback:**
This question is **very well-designed** and meets almost all criteria effectively. The information about the Hubbard interaction $U$ and topology is context that explains the emergence of PDW but doesn't directly enter the calculation of $E_g$ from the *given* $H_{MF}$, which is acceptable for contextualizing a specific problem. No significant improvements are needed.

---

**Overall Summary:**

Questions 1 and 2 are well-framed in terms of context and formatting but fall short on forcing multi-step reasoning as they provide too much of the solution. Question 3 is excellent and successfully meets all criteria, particularly in requiring substantial reasoning and calculation steps from the student.

A monolayer of 1T′-MoTe₂ exhibits interband nesting between electron and hole pockets, leading to a charge density wave (CDW) instability. Assume the electron and hole pockets are perfectly circular with radii $k_e$ and $k_h$ respectively, and centered at points separated by a wavevector $\mathbf{Q}$. The Fermi velocities at the electron and hole pockets are $v_e$ and $v_h$ respectively. Assuming perfect nesting (i.e., the Fermi surfaces align when shifted by $\mathbf{Q}$), calculate the magnitude of the CDW gap, $\Delta$, at $T=0$ in terms of the coupling constant $g$ between the electron and hole pockets, the Fermi velocities $v_e$ and $v_h$, and the electronic bandwidth, $W$.

Here's a critique of the provided physics questions based on the guidelines:

---

**Question 1: Monolayer 1T′-MoTe₂ CDW Instability**

*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** **Excellent.** Describes a specific, contemporary condensed matter physics scenario (CDW in 1T'-MoTe2, interband nesting).
*   **2. Expect answers as either a symbolic expression or a single numerical value with appropriate SI units:** **Excellent.** Clearly asks for a symbolic expression for the CDW gap in terms of given parameters.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** **Excellent.** Requires knowledge of the BCS-like gap equation, its application to CDW, and likely involves considering the effective density of states from the Fermi velocities and bandwidth.
*   **5. Be Unique:** **Excellent.** While the underlying BCS-like formalism is standard, the specific material and CDW context make this a novel problem.
*   **6. Single Solution:** **Excellent.** Clearly asks for a single, well-defined quantity.
*   **7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** **Excellent.** The language is precise and appropriate for advanced learners.
*   **9. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional physics notation:** **Excellent.** Symbols are standard and consistent.
*   **10. Questions must not be multipart:** **Excellent.** Focuses on calculating a single target quantity.
*   **11. Question Formatting:** **Excellent.** All inline math is correctly formatted.

**Critique & Improvement:**
This is an exceptionally well-crafted question. It effectively probes advanced understanding of collective phenomena in condensed matter. The wording is precise, and the scenario is current and relevant.

**Minor Point for Consideration (not a strict critique):**
The question provides Fermi velocities ($v_e, v_h$) and bandwidth ($W$), but not explicitly the density of states at the Fermi level, $N(0)$, which typically appears in the weak-coupling gap equation. While students at this level should be able to relate $v_e, v_h$ to an effective density of states (e.g., $N(0) \propto 1/v_F$ for 1D, or constant for 2D, or dependent on effective mass), this might require an additional step or assumption on the dimensionality/nature of the pockets. If $N(0)$ is expected to be expressed in terms of $v_e, v_h$ and other parameters like effective mass, it could be slightly more explicit. However, leaving it for the student to infer is also a valid challenge.

**Question 2: Superconductor-Charge Order Heterostructure**

*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** **Excellent.** Presents a complex and modern scenario involving heterostructures, topological materials, and interactions between different orders.
*   **2. Expect answers as either a symbolic expression or a single numerical value with appropriate SI units:** **Excellent.** Clearly asks for a symbolic expression for $T_c$.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** **Excellent.** Requires applying the Abrikosov-Gor'kov relation, understanding how to relate the scattering rate to the given parameters (density of states, energy scales, mean free path), and integrating these concepts.
*   **5. Be Unique:** **Excellent.** This is a highly novel and conceptually rich problem that combines several advanced topics.
*   **6. Single Solution:** **Excellent.** Asks for a single, well-defined quantity.
*   **7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** **Excellent.** The language is professional and clear for advanced learners.
*   **9. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional physics notation:** **Excellent.** Symbols are standard and consistent.
*   **10. Questions must not be multipart:** **Excellent.** Focuses on calculating a single target quantity.
*   **11. Question Formatting:** **Excellent.** All inline math is correctly formatted.

**Critique & Improvement:**
This is an outstanding question. It is highly challenging and requires a deep understanding of several advanced condensed matter concepts. The problem statement provides just enough information to guide the student towards formulating the scattering rate correctly for use in the Abrikosov-Gor'kov relation.

**Minor Point for Consideration (not a strict critique):**
The phrasing "The average spacing between scattering centers at the interface is $l$, and the scattering rate is inversely proportional to the mean free path" could be slightly confusing if "mean free path" is not explicitly defined as $l$. Students are typically expected to relate the scattering rate $\tau^{-1}$ to $v_F/l_{mfp}$. Here, $l$ is "average spacing," which often serves as the mean free path in such contexts. Clarifying "where $l$ is the mean free path" would remove any potential ambiguity, but it's a minor point given the context.

**Question 3: Quasi-One-Dimensional Pair-Density-Wave Material**

*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** **Excellent.** Describes a relevant and complex scenario involving correlations, topology, and pair-density-waves in a 1D system.
*   **2. Expect answers as either a symbolic expression or a single numerical value with appropriate SI units:** **Excellent.** Clearly asks for a symbolic expression for the energy gap $E_g$.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** **Excellent.** Requires constructing and diagonalizing the Bogoliubov–de Gennes Hamiltonian, a multi-step process crucial for understanding superconducting/pairing gaps.
*   **5. Be Unique:** **Excellent.** While the BdG formalism is standard, its application to a PDW with a finite center-of-mass momentum $Q=\pi/a$ makes it a unique and challenging problem.
*   **6. Single Solution:** **Excellent.** Asks for a single, well-defined quantity.
*   **7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** **Excellent.** The language is professional and clear for advanced learners.
*   **9. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional physics notation:** **Excellent.** Symbols are standard and consistent.
*   **10. Questions must not be multipart:** **Excellent.** Focuses on calculating a single target quantity.
*   **11. Question Formatting:** **Good, with one area for improvement.** Inline math is used correctly for smaller expressions.

**Critique & Improvement:**
This is a very strong question that effectively assesses a student's ability to apply advanced quantum mechanics/condensed matter techniques (BdG formalism) to a specific, complex pairing state. The dispersion and specific $Q$ make it solvable while still being challenging.

**Area for Improvement:**
The mean-field Hamiltonian: `$H_{MF} = \sum_k \epsilon(k) c_{k}^\dagger c_k + \Delta_{PDW} c_{k}^\dagger c_{-k+Q}^\dagger + \Delta_{PDW}^* c_{-k+Q} c_{k}$` is quite long for inline math. According to guideline 11, "Block math: use `$$...$$`" is for longer equations. Presenting this Hamiltonian as a block equation would significantly improve readability.

---

**Overall Assessment:**

All three questions are of extremely high quality, suitable for advanced undergraduate or graduate-level condensed matter physics courses. They meet almost all the guidelines perfectly. The minor suggestions for improvement are primarily stylistic or for minor clarification, not indicating any fundamental flaws in the question design. They are excellent examples of rigorous and relevant physics assessment.
