Consider a three-dimensional topological superconductor described by a Bogoliubov–de Gennes Hamiltonian with uranium impurity scattering modeled by a potential $V_{\mathrm{imp}}(\mathbf{r}) = U \sum_i \delta(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i)$. Assuming the clean system exhibits an $A_u$ fully gapped pairing symmetry analogous to the B phase of superfluid ${}^3\mathrm{He}$ with gap amplitude $\Delta_0$, derive the impurity-averaged quasiparticle density of states $N(E)$ at energy $E$ within the self-consistent Born approximation. Then, express the critical disorder strength $U_c$ at which the gap closes and the system transitions to a gapless phase in terms of $\Delta_0$ and the normal state density of states $N_0$ at the Fermi level.

In the heavy fermion superconductor $\mathrm{UTe}_2$, suppose the introduction of uranium defects induces a subdominant $B_{3u}$ pairing channel with order parameter amplitude $\Delta_{B_{3u}}$ that coexists with a dominant fully gapped $A_u$ state of amplitude $\Delta_{A_u}$. Given that the total gap function is $\Delta(\mathbf{k}) = \Delta_{A_u} + \alpha \Delta_{B_{3u}} f(\mathbf{k})$ where $f(\mathbf{k})$ is an odd parity function vanishing on certain symmetry planes, determine the minimal impurity concentration $n_{\mathrm{imp}}$ required so that the effective gap zeros appear on the Fermi surface.

Consider a three-dimensional topological superconductor described by a Bogoliubov–de Gennes Hamiltonian with uranium impurity scattering modeled by a potential $V_{\mathrm{imp}}(\mathbf{r}) = U \sum_i \delta(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i)$. Assuming the clean system exhibits an $A_u$ fully gapped pairing symmetry analogous to the B phase of superfluid ${}^3\mathrm{He}$ with gap amplitude $\Delta_0$, derive the impurity-averaged quasiparticle density of states $N(E)$ at energy $E$ within the self-consistent Born approximation. Then, express the critical disorder strength $U_c$ at which the gap closes and the system transitions to a gapless phase in terms of $\Delta_0$ and the normal state density of states $N_0$ at the Fermi level.  
</question>

**Feedback:**
- **Strengths:**  
  - Clearly models an advanced condensed matter scenario (Guideline 1).
  - Expects symbolic answers ($N(E)$ and $U_c$), satisfying Guideline 2.
  - Requires multi-step reasoning (impurity averaging, density of states, gap-closing condition) (Guideline 3).
  - No unnecessary variables included (Guideline 4).
  - Not a standard textbook problem, promoting uniqueness (Guideline 5).
- **Issues:**  
  - **Multipart violation:** Asks for both $N(E)$ and $U_c$ (Guideline 10). Each question must require only one target answer.
  - **Clarity:** The phrase “derive… then, express…” explicitly indicates two tasks.
  - **Formatting:** LaTeX syntax inside markdown is correct, and variables are well defined (Guidelines 7, 9).
- **Action:** Split into two separate questions: one for $N(E)$, one for $U_c$. Revise question to focus on a single target quantity.

<question>  
In the heavy fermion superconductor $\mathrm{UTe}_2$, suppose the introduction of uranium defects induces a subdominant $B_{3u}$ pairing channel with order parameter amplitude $\Delta_{B_{3u}}$ that coexists with a dominant fully gapped $A_u$ state of amplitude $\Delta_{A_u}$. Given that the total gap function is $\Delta(\mathbf{k}) = \Delta_{A_u} + \alpha \Delta_{B_{3u}} f(\mathbf{k})$ where $f(\mathbf{k})$ is an odd parity function vanishing on certain symmetry planes, determine the minimal impurity concentration $n_{\mathrm{imp}}$ required so that the effective gap zeros appear on the Fermi surface. Express $n_{\mathrm{imp}}$ in terms of the coefficients $\alpha$, $\Delta_{A_u}$, and the functional form of $f(\mathbf{k})$ on the Fermi surface, assuming a linear relation between impurity concentration and $\Delta_{B_{3u}}$.  
</question>

**Feedback:**
- **Strengths:**
  - Models a realistic, advanced physical scenario (Guideline 1).
  - Requests a single symbolic answer for $n_{\mathrm{imp}}$ (Guideline 2).
  - Multi-step reasoning: superposition of order parameters, conditions for gap zeros, impurity effects (Guideline 3).
  - Variables are all necessary and relevant (Guideline 4).
- **Issues:**
  - **Ambiguity:** “Functional form of $f(\mathbf{k})$ on the Fermi surface” is imprecise—should clarify exactly how $f(\mathbf{k})$ is to be used in the answer (Guideline 8).
  - **Units:** $n_{\mathrm{imp}}$ should be specified as a concentration, i.e., per unit volume, for clarity (Guideline 9).
- **Action:** State explicitly how $f(\mathbf{k})$ is to be used/evaluated. For example: “…express $n_{\mathrm{imp}}$ in terms of $\alpha$, $\Delta_{A_u}$, and the maximum/minimum value of $|f(\mathbf{k})|$ on the Fermi surface…”  
  Also, specify units for $n_{\mathrm{imp}}$ where appropriate.

<question>  
Assuming $\mathrm{UTe}_2$ exhibits a fully gapped $A_u$ superconducting state, model the temperature dependence of the London penetration depth $\lambda(T)$ in the presence of weak uranium impurity scattering characterized by a mean free path $\ell_{\mathrm{imp}}$. Given the pristine zero-temperature penetration depth $\lambda_0$ and superconducting gap $\Delta_0$, derive an expression for $\lambda(T)$ to leading order in $T \ll T_c$ incorporating both impurity-induced pairbreaking and thermally activated quasiparticles. Express the low-temperature slope $d\lambda/dT$ in terms of $\Delta_0$, $\lambda_0$, and $\ell_{\mathrm{imp}}$.  
</question>

**Feedback:**
- **Strengths:**
  - Excellent scenario—conceptually rich and authentic (Guideline 1).
  - Requires symbolic answer for $d\lambda/dT$ (Guideline 2).
  - Solution requires use of multiple physical concepts (pairbreaking and thermal excitations) (Guideline 3).
  - All details included are necessary (Guideline 4).
  - Uniqueness and concise technical phrasing (Guidelines 5, 7, 8).
  - Consistent units and correct notation (Guideline 9).
- **Issues:**  
  - **Minor:** The problem first asks for an expression for $\lambda(T)$, then for the slope $d\lambda/dT$—this could be interpreted as two steps, violating the “single-solution” criterion (Guideline 10).
- **Action:** Focus directly on the derivative: “…derive the low-temperature slope $d\lambda/dT$ in terms of…” OR, only ask for $\lambda(T)$ to leading order if the intent is that this is sufficient for the slope. Clarify which to provide.

<question>  
For a non-Abelian topological superconductor with a dominant $A_u$ pairing symmetry, the presence of uranium impurities leads to localized bound states described by Yu-Shiba-Rusinov theory. Given the impurity potential strength $J$ and superconducting gap $\Delta_0$, calculate the energy $E_{\mathrm{BS}}$ of the midgap bound state induced by a single impurity in the unitary limit ($J \to \infty$). Express $E_{\mathrm{BS}}$ symbolically and discuss its evolution as $J$ varies from weak to strong coupling.  
</question>

**Feedback:**
- **Strengths:**
  - Models a sophisticated nontrivial scenario (Guideline 1).
  - Requests a symbolic expression for $E_{\mathrm{BS}}$ in a particular limit (Guideline 2).
  - Multi-step physical reasoning necessary (Guideline 3).
- **Issues:**
  - **Multipart violation:** Asks both for $E_{\mathrm{BS}}$ in the unitary limit and to “discuss its evolution as $J$ varies” (Guideline 10). Must focus on a single quantity.
  - **Ambiguity:** “Discuss” is not precise or suited to a formula-based answer (Guideline 8).
  - **Units:** $J$ should be clearly defined (exchange energy? dimensionless coupling?). Consider explicit unit requirements (Guideline 9).
- **Action:** Only ask for $E_{\mathrm{BS}}$ in the specified limit, or separately for a general $J$ if desired—but do not combine with a qualitative “discuss.” Specify what $J$ is (units).

<question>  
In $\mathrm{UTe}_2$, a fully gapped phase with $A_u$ symmetry can be described effectively by an isotropic gap $\Delta_0$. Impurities introduce quasiparticle scattering with rate $\Gamma = \hbar/(2\tau)$, where $\tau$ is the scattering time. Using the Abrikosov-Gor'kov formalism, find the critical scattering rate $\Gamma_c$ at which the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ is suppressed to zero. Express $\Gamma_c$ as a function of the clean-limit critical temperature $T_{c0}$.  
</question>

**Feedback:**
- **Strengths:**  
  - Well-posed real-world scenario (Guideline 1).
  - Symbolic solution for $\Gamma_c$ (Guideline 2).
  - Requires two physical principles—pairbreaking and transition temperature suppression (Guideline 3).
  - No unnecessary detail (Guideline 4).
  - Technically precise and unambiguous (Guidelines 5, 7, 8).
  - Clear, correct units and notation (Guideline 9).
  - Has only one answer (Guideline 10).
- **Issues:**  
  - None significant; this is an exemplary question.
- **Action:** No improvements needed.

---

### **Overall Recommendations**

- **Multipart Questions**: Revise any question that asks for more than one result (“find $X$ and then $Y$”; “derive $X$, then discuss $Y$”, etc.)—split into single-question prompts.
- **Target Quantity**: Ask for only one symbolic/numeric result per question.
- **Precision/Clarity**: Where functional dependencies or evaluation on surfaces is involved (e.g., $f(\mathbf{k})$), specify what is meant (e.g., min/max on Fermi surface).
- **Units/Definitions**: Always ensure each quantity’s physical nature and units are explicit.
- **Solution Formatting**: Maintain strict LaTeX for all math in markdown; continue to wrap questions in <question>...</question> tags.

**Summary**:  
Most questions show high technical merit and creativity. The only recurring issue is multipart phrasing—refocus each to one single answer per question. Otherwise, clarity, notation, and uniqueness are well met.

### Summary of Actionable Recommendations

1. **Trim Repetition:** Where possible, reference previous questions ("same system as above") to minimize repeated context.
2. **Display Math:** Use Markdown properly: Inline math with `$...$`, block math with `$$...$$`.
3. **Clarify Variable Dependencies:** If a parameter is proportional (e.g., $\Delta_{B_{3u}}$ to $n_{\mathrm{imp}}$), introduce or mention the proportionality constant explicitly.
4. **State Limiting Cases Up Front:** e.g., For low-temperature expansions, put “to leading order in $T \ll T_c$” at the beginning of the relevant sentence.
5. **Check for Hidden Variables:** Make sure all parameters needed for symbolic solution are defined or, if necessary, allow an undetermined proportionality constant.
6. **Precision in Wording:** Continue the already rigorous phrasing; very little to change here.

**Overall:**  
Your questions are excellent, especially for an advanced/graduate assessment in condensed matter physics. Only minor adjustments are recommended for maximum clarity and brevity. Your Markdown and LaTeX formatting are correct for the most part, but always double-check inline vs. block math usage.
