<question>
A modified theory of gravity postulates that the effective gravitational constant, $G_{eff}$, depends on the electromagnetic field strength, $F_{\mu\nu}$, according to the relation $G_{eff} = G_0 (1 + \alpha F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu})$, where $G_0$ is the standard gravitational constant and $\alpha$ is a coupling constant with dimensions $[\text{T}^{-2}\text{L}^{-2}\text{M}^{-1}]$. Consider a region of space near a neutron star where the magnetic field is uniform and has a magnitude $B = 10^8 \, \text{T}$. Assuming the electric field is negligible, determine the fractional change in the effective gravitational constant, $\frac{G_{eff} - G_0}{G_0}$, in this region if $\alpha = 10^{-50} \, \text{kg}^{-1}\text{m}^{-2}\text{s}^{2}$.

In a modified theory of electromagnetism, the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ and magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ are derived from a four-potential $A_\mu$ through a modified electromagnetic tensor $F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu + \xi (\partial^\alpha A_\alpha) g_{\mu\nu}$, where $\xi$ is a dimensionless constant and $g_{\mu\nu}$ is the Minkowski metric. Consider a scenario where the four-potential is given by $A_\mu = (0, 0, 0, ct)$, implying a constant electric potential. Calculate the electric field component $E_z$ resulting from this modified theory, given that $\xi = 0.1$ and $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$.

<question>
A black hole solution in a modified theory of gravity possesses an emergent metric with a structure function $f(r) = 1 - \frac{2M}{r} + \frac{Q^2}{r^2} + \beta r$, where $M$ is the mass of the black hole, $Q$ is a charge parameter, $r$ is the radial coordinate, and $\beta$ is a parameter quantifying the deviation from General Relativity with units of $[\text{L}^{-2}]$. For a black hole with $M = 10^{30} \, \text{kg}$ and $Q = 10^{20} \, \text{C}$, find the value of $\beta$ such that the radius of the event horizon (the largest real root of $f(r) = 0$) is equal to $3 \times 10^3 \, \text{m}$.
</question>

<question>
A modified gravity theory introduces a scalar field $\phi$ that couples to the Ricci scalar $R$ as $f(R, \phi) = R + \gamma \phi^2 R$, where $\gamma$ is a coupling constant with dimensions of $[\text{M}^{-2}\text{L}^4\text{T}^2]$. In a region of spacetime where the Ricci scalar is constant, $R = R_0$, and the scalar field has a spatial gradient given by $\nabla \phi = k \mathbf{\hat{r}}$, where $k$ is a constant with units $[\text{M}\text{L}^{-2}\text{T}^{-1}]$ and $\mathbf{\hat{r}}$ is the radial unit vector, determine the effective gravitational constant $G_{eff}$ if $G_{eff} = G_0 (1 + \gamma \phi^2) $, given that at a specific point $\phi = 10^{10} \, \text{kg/ms}$, $\gamma = 10^{-40} \, \text{kg}^ {-2} \text{m}^4 \text{s}^2$, and calculate the fractional change of the gravitational constant from the standard value, i.e. $(G_{eff} - G_0)/G_0$.
</question>

<question>
Consider a spacetime described by a metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$. A symmetry transformation is defined such that the metric remains invariant under this transformation, i.e., $x^\mu \rightarrow x'^\mu = x^\mu + \epsilon k^\mu(x)$, where $\epsilon$ is an infinitesimal parameter and $k^\mu(x)$ is a Killing vector field. If the electromagnetic field tensor transforms as $F'_{\mu\nu}(x') = F_{\mu\nu}(x) + \epsilon \mathcal{L}_k F_{\mu\nu}$, where $\mathcal{L}_k$ is the Lie derivative along $k^\mu$, and the condition for invariance of the electromagnetic field is $\mathcal{L}_k F_{\mu\nu} = 0$, determine the constraint on the components of the electromagnetic field tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$ if the Killing vector is $k^\mu = (0, 0, 1, 0)$ in Cartesian coordinates $(t, x, y, z)$, representing a translation along the y-axis. Express your answer in terms of a derivative of the components of $F_{\mu\nu}$.

A modified theory of gravity postulates that the effective gravitational constant, $G_{eff}$, depends on the electromagnetic field strength, $F_{\mu\nu}$, according to the relation $G_{eff} = G_0 (1 + \alpha F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu})$, where $G_0$ is the standard gravitational constant and $\alpha$ is a coupling constant with dimensions $[\text{T}^{-2}\text{L}^{-2}\text{M}^{-1}]$.

</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** The primary challenge here is interpreting $F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$ for a given magnetic field. While this involves recalling definitions, the core problem is bogged down by a severe dimensional inconsistency, preventing multi-step physical reasoning.
*   **Guideline 8 (Units must be consistent):** This is the major flaw. The provided units for $\alpha$ ($[\text{M}^{-1}\text{L}^{-2}\text{T}^{2}]$) are inconsistent with the standard interpretation of $F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$ (which typically has units of $[\text{T}^2]$ or proportional to $[\text{J}/\text{m}^3]$). For $\alpha F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$ to be dimensionless (as required for addition to 1), $F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$ would need to have units of $[\text{M}\text{L}^{2}\text{T}^{-2}]$. This is highly non-standard for the electromagnetic field tensor invariant. The question as stated is dimensionally inconsistent and thus un-solvable without further redefinition.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1.  **Resolve Dimensional Inconsistency:** Either explicitly define $F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$ as a quantity with units $[\text{M}\text{L}^{2}\text{T}^{-2}]$ (e.g., "where $F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$ is a scalar quantity numerically equal to $B^2$ but with units of energy"), or, more commonly, change the units of $\alpha$ to be consistent with the standard invariant (e.g., $T^{-2}$ or $(\text{J}/\text{m}^3)^{-1}$). This requires a clear statement of the chosen convention for $F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$ in SI units.
2.  **Clarify $F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$:** Specify the exact form of $F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$ in terms of $B$ and $E$ in SI units (e.g., $2(\mu_0 B^2 - \frac{1}{\mu_0 c^2} E^2)$ or similar conventions if not using energy density directly), including any necessary constants ($c, \mu_0, \epsilon_0$).

<question>
In a modified theory of electromagnetism, the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ and magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ are derived from a four-potential $A_\mu$ through a modified electromagnetic tensor $F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu + \xi (\partial^\alpha A_\alpha) g_{\mu\nu}$, where $\xi$ is a dimensionless constant and $g_{\mu\nu}$ is the Minkowski metric. Consider a scenario where the four-potential is given by $A_\mu = (0, 0, 0, ct)$, implying a constant electric potential. Calculate the electric field component $E_z$ resulting from this modified theory, given that $\xi = 0.1$ and $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$.
</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** The chosen four-potential $A_\mu = (0, 0, 0, ct)$ leads to $\partial^\alpha A_\alpha = 0$ (assuming standard Minkowski metric and coordinates $(t,x,y,z)$ where $A_3 = ct$). This makes the modified term $\xi (\partial^\alpha A_\alpha) g_{\mu\nu}$ vanish identically, rendering $\xi$ irrelevant and reducing the problem to a standard, basic electromagnetic tensor calculation. This does not fulfill the multi-step reasoning requirement for a "modified theory" problem.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, concise phrasing / No Hints):**
    *   The phrase "$A_\mu = (0, 0, 0, ct)$, implying a constant electric potential" is incorrect and misleading. A constant electric potential usually means $A_0$ is a non-zero constant. Here $A_0 = 0$.
    *   The choice of $A_\mu$ effectively makes $\xi$ a distractor, which goes against the "no hints" principle.
*   **Guideline 7 (All assumptions must be clearly stated):** The convention for extracting $E_z$ from $F_{\mu\nu}$ (e.g., $E_z = cF_{03}$ or $E_z = F_{03}$) should be explicitly stated, as it depends on whether the time coordinate is $t$ or $ct$. Assuming standard $(t,x,y,z)$ coordinates and $A_0 = \phi/c$, then $E_z = cF_{03}$.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1.  **Revise $A_\mu$:** Choose a four-potential (e.g., $A_\mu = (ct, 0, 0, 0)$ or a more complex one) such that $\partial^\alpha A_\alpha$ is non-zero, making the modified term relevant and forcing the student to engage with $\xi$.
2.  **Clarify $A_0$ and "Electric Potential":** Remove the misleading statement about "constant electric potential."
3.  **Specify EM Field Extraction:** Clearly state the convention for relating $E_i$ and $B_i$ to $F_{\mu\nu}$ components for the chosen coordinate system (e.g., $E_i = c F_{0i}$ in SI units for $x^0=t$).

<question>
A black hole solution in a modified theory of gravity possesses an emergent metric with a structure function $f(r) = 1 - \frac{2M}{r} + \frac{Q^2}{r^2} + \beta r$, where $M$ is the mass of the black hole, $Q$ is a charge parameter, $r$ is the radial coordinate, and $\beta$ is a parameter quantifying the deviation from General Relativity with units of $[\text{L}^{-2}]$. For a black hole with $M = 10^{30} \, \text{kg}$ and $Q = 10^{20} \, \text{C}$, find the value of $\beta$ such that the radius of the event horizon (the largest real root of $f(r) = 0$) is equal to $3 \times 10^3 \, \text{m}$.
</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** This question is primarily an algebraic substitution problem. Once $f(r)=0$ is set, solving for $\beta$ is a direct rearrangement: $\beta = -\frac{1}{r} + \frac{2M}{r^2} - \frac{Q^2}{r^3}$. This lacks significant multi-step *physical* reasoning, although it tests algebraic competence. The "largest real root" part is a distractor given that $r$ is provided.
*   **Guideline 8 (Units must be consistent):** This is a critical dimensional inconsistency. If $M$ is in $[\text{kg}]$ and $Q$ is in $[\text{C}]$ (SI units), then for $f(r)$ to be dimensionless (as it should be in a metric component), the terms $\frac{2M}{r}$ and $\frac{Q^2}{r^2}$ are dimensionally incorrect. For example, the Schwarzschild term is $\frac{2GM}{c^2r}$ and the Reissner-Nordstrom term is $\frac{GQ^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 c^4 r^2}$. The question implicitly assumes $G$ and $c$ are unity or absorbed into $M$ and $Q$, which must be stated explicitly. Without this, the problem is physically ill-posed in SI units.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1.  **Resolve Dimensional Inconsistency:** Explicitly state that $M$ and $Q$ are effective parameters in geometrized units, or include the fundamental constants $G$ and $c$ in the terms (e.g., $1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2r} + \frac{GQ^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 c^4 r^2}$). Providing $M$ in kg and $Q$ in C necessitates this clarification.
2.  **Enhance Multi-Step Reasoning:** To make it more challenging, one could provide $\beta$ and ask for the conditions on $M$ or $Q$ for the existence of horizons, or ask for the properties of the black hole (e.g., temperature) requiring further physical principles.

<question>
A modified gravity theory introduces a scalar field $\phi$ that couples to the Ricci scalar $R$ as $f(R, \phi) = R + \gamma \phi^2 R$, where $\gamma$ is a coupling constant with dimensions of $[\text{M}^{-2}\text{L}^4\text{T}^2]$. In a region of spacetime where the Ricci scalar is constant, $R = R_0$, and the scalar field has a spatial gradient given by $\nabla \phi = k \mathbf{\hat{r}}$, where $k$ is a constant with units $[\text{M}\text{L}^{-2}\text{T}^{-1}]$ and $\mathbf{\hat{r}}$ is the radial unit vector, determine the effective gravitational constant $G_{eff}$ if $G_{eff} = G_0 (1 + \gamma \phi^2) $, given that at a specific point $\phi = 10^{10} \, \text{kg/ms}$, $\gamma = 10^{-40} \, \text{kg}^ {-2} \text{m}^4 \text{s}^2$, and calculate the fractional change of the gravitational constant from the standard value, i.e. $(G_{eff} - G_0)/G_0$.
</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** The question directly provides the formula for $G_{eff}$ and all necessary numerical values. Calculating $G_{eff}$ and then the fractional change is a direct, single-step substitution. This does not meet the "multi-step reasoning" requirement.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, concise phrasing / No Hints):** The information about the Ricci scalar ($R=R_0$) and the scalar field's spatial gradient ($\nabla \phi = k \mathbf{\hat{r}}$, with $k$ and its units defined) is entirely irrelevant to the calculation of $G_{eff}$ as given. This serves as a distractor, violating the principle of conciseness and avoiding hints.
*   **Guideline 8 (Units must be consistent):** This is a fatal dimensional inconsistency.
    *   Units of $\gamma$: $[\text{M}^{-2}\text{L}^4\text{T}^2]$
    *   Units of $\phi$: $[\text{kg/ms}] = [\text{M}\text{L}^{-1}\text{T}^{-1}]$
    *   Units of $\gamma \phi^2$: $[\text{M}^{-2}\text{L}^4\text{T}^2] \cdot ([\text{M}\text{L}^{-1}\text{T}^{-1}])^2 = [\text{M}^{-2}\text{L}^4\text{T}^2] \cdot [\text{M}^{2}\text{L}^{-2}\text{T}^{-2}] = [\text{L}^2]$.
    *   For the term $(1 + \gamma \phi^2)$ to be meaningful, $\gamma \phi^2$ must be dimensionless. The current units yield $[\text{L}^2]$. This makes the expression $G_{eff} = G_0 (1 + \gamma \phi^2)$ dimensionally incorrect and unsolvable as a physical problem.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1.  **Resolve Dimensional Inconsistency:** Correct the units of $\gamma$ (or $\phi$) so that the product $\gamma \phi^2$ is dimensionless. For example, if $\phi$ is truly a field with units of $\text{kg/ms}$, then $\gamma$ would need units of $\text{m}^2\text{s}^2/\text{kg}^2$ (i.e., $[\text{M}^{-2}\text{L}^2\text{T}^2]$) for $\gamma \phi^2$ to be dimensionless.
2.  **Remove Irrelevant Information:** Eliminate all information not directly used in solving for the target quantity ($R_0$, $\nabla \phi$, $k$).
3.  **Enhance Multi-Step Reasoning:** Instead of directly giving $G_{eff}$, provide a more fundamental relation (e.g., related to the scalar field's dynamics or background spacetime geometry) from which $G_{eff}$ must be derived, requiring more analytical steps.

<question>
Consider a spacetime described by a metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$. A symmetry transformation is defined such that the metric remains invariant under this transformation, i.e., $x^\mu \rightarrow x'^\mu = x^\mu + \epsilon k^\mu(x)$, where $\epsilon$ is an infinitesimal parameter and $k^\mu(x)$ is a Killing vector field. If the electromagnetic field tensor transforms as $F'_{\mu\nu}(x') = F_{\mu\nu}(x) + \epsilon \mathcal{L}_k F_{\mu\nu}$, where $\mathcal{L}_k$ is the Lie derivative along $k^\mu$, and the condition for invariance of the electromagnetic field is $\mathcal{L}_k F_{\mu\nu} = 0$, determine the constraint on the components of the electromagnetic field tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$ if the Killing vector is $k^\mu = (0, 0, 1, 0)$ in Cartesian coordinates $(t, x, y, z)$, representing a translation along the y-axis. Express your answer in terms of a derivative of the components of $F_{\mu\nu}$.
</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** This question requires knowledge of the Lie derivative formula and its application. However, the choice of a constant Killing vector field $k^\mu = (0,0,1,0)$ significantly simplifies the Lie derivative. Since $\partial_\rho k^\mu = 0$ for all $\rho, \mu$, two of the three terms in the standard Lie derivative formula ($\mathcal{L}_k F_{\mu\nu} = k^\rho \partial_\rho F_{\mu\nu} + (\partial_\mu k^\rho) F_{\rho\nu} + (\partial_\nu k^\rho) F_{\mu\rho}$) vanish. This reduces the problem to $\mathcal{L}_k F_{\mu\nu} = k^\rho \partial_\rho F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_y F_{\mu\nu}$. While this tests knowledge of the definition, it doesn't force engagement with the more complex parts of the formula.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1.  **Enhance Multi-Step Reasoning:** To better fulfill the "multi-step reasoning" guideline, choose a non-constant Killing vector field (e.g., for boosts or rotations). This would require the student to calculate and incorporate the $\partial k$ terms, making the application of the Lie derivative formula more involved. For instance, a Killing vector representing a rotation in the x-y plane would be $k^\mu = (0, -y, x, 0)$.

    In a modified theory of electromagnetism, the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ and magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ are derived from a four-potential $A_\mu$ through a modified electromagnetic tensor $F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu + \xi (\partial^\alpha A_\alpha) g_{\mu\nu}$, where $\xi$ is a dimensionless constant and $g_{\mu\nu}$ is the Minkowski metric. Assume the metric signature is (+,-,-,-). Consider a scenario where the four-potential is given by $A_\mu = (c_0 t, 0, 0, 0)$, where $c_0$ is the standard speed of light. If the electric field components are defined as $E_i = c_0 F_{0i}$ in SI units, calculate the electric field component $E_x$ resulting from this modified theory, given that $\xi = 0.1$ and $c_0 = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$.
    </question>
    ```

    **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 8 (Units Consistency):** This is the **major flaw** in the original question.
        *   If $A_0 = ct$ (or $c_0 t$), then $A_0$ has units of length (meters).
        *   Consequently, $\partial_\mu A_\nu$ would be dimensionless (e.g., $\partial_0 A_0 = \partial_t(c_0 t) = c_0$ (dimensionless if $t$ is in length units and $c_0$ is dimensionless 1, but here $t$ is time and $c_0$ is speed)). More correctly, $\partial_t(c_0 t)$ yields $c_0$, which is a speed in SI units. If $A_\mu$ were in units of $V \cdot s / m$, then $F_{\mu\nu}$ would be in $V/m$.
        *   However, if $A_0 = c_0 t$ has units of $m$, then $\partial_0 A_0$ is dimensionless. If $F_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless, then $E_i = c_0 F_{0i}$ implies $E_i$ has units of speed (m/s), not electric field (V/m).
        *   This unit inconsistency makes the problem unsolvable in SI units as stated.
    *   **Actionable Feedback:** The definition of $A_\mu$ (e.g., units of $A_\mu$) and the relation $E_i = c_0 F_{0i}$ must be made consistent with SI units for electric field.
        *   **Option 1 (Preferred for SI):** Redefine $A_\mu$. For instance, $A_0 = \Phi/c_0$ where $\Phi$ is scalar potential (Volts). Then $A_0$ has units of $\text{V} \cdot \text{s}/\text{m}$. Or set $A_0 = \Phi$ and use $F_{0i} = - \partial_0 A_i + \partial_i A_0 = \frac{E_i}{c}$ (depending on conventions).
        *   **Option 2 (Natural Units):** State that the problem is in natural units where $c_0=1$ and all quantities are dimensionless, or imply a system where $E_i$ emerges with consistent units. However, the requirement for SI units in the answer means this is not ideal.
    *   **Minor improvements:** Renamed $c$ to $c_0$ to avoid confusion with the actual speed of light if $c$ were to be treated as a conversion factor. Added "standard" to $c_0$. Moved "Assume the metric signature..." for better flow.

    *   **Guideline 10 (No Hints):** The original question explicitly included a hint: "*Hint: consider the discriminant of the cubic equation.*" This directly violates the guideline.
    *   **Actionable Feedback:** Remove the hint entirely. This is a problem for advanced learners who should be expected to identify the appropriate mathematical tools for solving such problems.
    *   **Overall:** A very challenging and unique problem. Removing the hint makes it an even stronger assessment of a student's problem-solving skills.

    <question>
    A modified gravity theory introduces a scalar field $\phi$ that couples to the Ricci scalar $R$ as $f(R, \phi) = R + \gamma \phi^2 R$, where $\gamma$ is a coupling constant with dimensions of $[\text{M}^{-2}\text{L}^2\text{T}^2]$. In a region of spacetime, the effective gravitational constant is given by $G_{eff} = G_0 (1 + \gamma \phi^2) $. Suppose the scalar field evolves according to the equation $\Box \phi = \lambda \phi R$, where $\Box$ is the d'Alembertian operator and $\lambda$ is a dimensionless constant. Assuming a static, spherically symmetric spacetime with a constant Ricci scalar $R = R_0$ and a scalar field profile $\phi(r) = A e^{-r/L}$, where $A$ and $L$ are constants, and neglecting time derivatives, find the value of $L$ (in meters) in terms of $R_0$, $\lambda$, and $c$ (the speed of light).
    </question>
    ```

    **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions/Variables):** The term "d'Alembertian operator" usually implies $\Box = \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2$. While "neglecting time derivatives" simplifies this to $-\nabla^2$, students might need to explicitly know the form of the Laplacian in spherical coordinates for a general spacetime to solve it rigorously. For advanced learners, this might be assumed knowledge. The implied units of $\phi$ (mass*time) are unusual but self-consistent within the given equations.
    *   **Overall:** This is a very good, complex problem. No critical issues, just minor points of clarity if aiming for extreme precision regarding the assumed form of operators or field units.

    Consider a spacetime described by a metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$. A symmetry transformation is defined such that the metric remains invariant under this transformation, i.e., $x^\mu \rightarrow x'^\mu = x^\mu + \epsilon k^\mu(x)$, where $\epsilon$ is an infinitesimal parameter and $k^\mu(x)$ is a Killing vector field. If the electromagnetic field tensor transforms as $F'_{\mu\nu}(x') = F_{\mu\nu}(x) + \epsilon \mathcal{L}_k F_{\mu\nu}$, where $\mathcal{L}_k$ is the Lie derivative along $k^\mu$, and the condition for invariance of the electromagnetic field is $\mathcal{L}_k F_{\mu\nu} = 0$, determine the constraint on the components of the electromagnetic field tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$ if the Killing vector is $k^\mu = (0, -y, x, 0)$ in Cartesian coordinates $(t, x, y, z)$, representing a rotation in the x-y plane. Express your answer in terms of derivatives of the components of $F_{\mu\nu}$.

    **Critique:**
    *   **Overall:** This is an **excellent** question. It is highly unique, requires multi-step reasoning involving advanced concepts (Killing vectors, Lie derivatives, tensor calculus), expects a symbolic solution, is rigorously phrased, and has no hints. All guidelines are met.

A modified theory of gravity postulates that the effective gravitational constant, $G_{eff}$, depends on the electromagnetic field strength, $F_{\mu\nu}$, according to the relation $G_{eff} = G_0 (1 + \alpha F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu})$, where $G_0$ is the standard gravitational constant and $\alpha$ is a coupling constant. Consider a region of space near a magnetar where the magnetic field is uniform and has a magnitude $B = 10^{10} \, \text{T}$. Assuming the electric field is negligible, determine the fractional change in the effective gravitational constant, $\frac{G_{eff} - G_0}{G_0}$, in this region if $\alpha = 10^{-24} \, \text{T}^{-2}$. The term $F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$ is given in SI units by $2(\mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{B} - \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{E}/c^2)$, where $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$ is the speed of light.

In a modified theory of electromagnetism, the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ and magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ are derived from a four-potential $A_\mu$ through a modified electromagnetic tensor $F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu + \xi (\partial^\alpha A_\alpha) g_{\mu\nu}$, where $\xi$ is a dimensionless constant and $g_{\mu\nu}$ is the Minkowski metric. Assume the metric signature is (+,-,-,-). Consider a scenario where the four-potential is given by $A_\mu = (c_0 t, 0, 0, 0)$, where $c_0$ is the standard speed of light.

A black hole solution in a modified theory of gravity possesses an emergent metric with a structure function $f(r) = 1 - \frac{2M}{r} + \frac{Q^2}{r^2} + \beta r$, where $M$ is the mass of the black hole, $Q$ is a charge parameter, $r$ is the radial coordinate, and $\beta$ is a parameter quantifying the deviation from General Relativity with units of $[\text{L}^{-2}]$.
