Consider a uniaxial anisotropic crystal with its optical axis (OA) aligned along the z-axis. The permittivity tensor is given by $\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \begin{bmatrix} n_o^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & n_o^2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & n_e^2 \end{bmatrix}$, where $n_o$ and $n_e$ are the ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices, respectively. A linearly polarized light beam with wavelength $\lambda = 633 \, \mathrm{nm}$ propagates through the crystal along the y-axis.

<question>
An anisotropic metamaterial slab exhibits an in-plane anisotropy. Its permittivity tensor in the xy-plane is given by $\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}$. A transverse electric (TE) polarized wave at frequency $f = 100 \, \mathrm{THz}$ is incident normally on the slab. The slab thickness is $d = 500 \, \mathrm{nm}$. Calculate the effective refractive index experienced by the TE mode in this anisotropic material. Assume the relative permeability $\mu_r = 1$.
</question>

**Critique:**
This question has some ambiguities and redundant information.
*   **Models a Physics Scenario:** Yes, anisotropic metamaterial is a relevant scenario.
*   **Answers as Numerical Value with SI Units:** Yes.
*   **Forces Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes, requires understanding TE modes in anisotropic media, finding eigenvalues of the permittivity tensor, and relating them to refractive indices.
*   **Unique:** The specific tensor and metamaterial context are good.
*   **Single Solution:** **Problematic.** For a TE wave propagating normally (e.g., along z) in a medium with the given in-plane anisotropy, there will generally be *two* effective refractive indices corresponding to the two eigenmodes (polarizations) within the xy-plane. The question asks for "the effective refractive index," implying a single value. This is ambiguous. It either needs to specify the polarization of the incident TE wave or ask for the effective indices of the two eigenmodes.
*   **Rigorous, Concise Phrasing:** Mostly, but the "the effective refractive index" causes ambiguity.
*   **All Assumptions Stated, Variables Defined:** The 2x2 tensor for "in-plane anisotropy" needs to be more explicitly linked to propagation along z (i.e., this is the relevant sub-tensor for $E_x, E_y$ components with $E_z=0$).
*   **Units Consistent, Conventional Notation:** Yes.
*   **Not Multipart:** Aims for a single quantity, but its ambiguity could lead to multiple valid answers.
*   **Formatting:** Correct.
*   **Tags:** Correct.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Clarify Ambiguity:** Rephrase "the effective refractive index" to specify which one (e.g., "for an incident TE wave polarized along its fast axis") or ask for "the two effective refractive indices" to acknowledge both eigenmodes.
2.  **Remove Redundancy:** The frequency $f$ and slab thickness $d$ are not necessary for calculating *only* the effective refractive index. Remove them or modify the question to require a calculation where they are relevant (e.g., total phase delay, transmission/reflection).
3.  **Clarify Tensor Context:** Explicitly state that the given 2x2 tensor applies to the electric field components $E_x$ and $E_y$ for a wave propagating along the z-axis, which is the standard interpretation for a TE wave in this context.

<question>
A chiral material is characterized by a permittivity tensor with off-diagonal elements that introduce optical activity. The permittivity tensor is approximated as $\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \begin{bmatrix} n^2 & i\delta \\ -i\delta & n^2 \end{bmatrix}$, where $n = 1.5$ is the average refractive index and $\delta = 0.01$ represents the chirality parameter. A linearly polarized light beam with intensity $I_0$ at wavelength $\lambda = 532 \, \mathrm{nm}$ is incident on a slab of this material with thickness $d = 1 \, \mathrm{mm}$. Calculate the angle of rotation $\theta$ (in degrees) of the polarization direction of the light after passing through the chiral material.
</question>

**Critique:**
This question is mostly good, with one minor point.
*   **Models a Physics Scenario:** Yes, optical activity in chiral materials is a standard scenario.
*   **Answers as Numerical Value with SI Units:** Yes, angle in degrees.
*   **Forces Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes, involves finding the refractive indices for the two circularly polarized eigenmodes from the tensor, calculating their difference, and then using the optical rotation formula.
*   **Unique:** The specific form of the permittivity tensor is a good way to introduce this concept from a matrix perspective.
*   **Single Solution:** Yes.
*   **Rigorous, Concise Phrasing:** Yes.
*   **All Assumptions Stated, Variables Defined:** Yes, tensor form, parameters, light properties, and material thickness are defined. Implicitly normal incidence is assumed, which is standard.
*   **Units Consistent, Conventional Notation:** Yes.
*   **Not Multipart:** Solves for a single quantity.
*   **Formatting:** Correct.
*   **Tags:** Correct.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Remove Redundancy:** The incident intensity $I_0$ is given but not used in the calculation of the rotation angle. While a minor distractor, it's good practice to ensure all provided numerical values are relevant to the solution path for advanced learners.

<question>
Consider an anisotropic crystal with a tilted optical axis. The crystal's permittivity tensor in the principal coordinate system is given by $\epsilon' = \epsilon_0 \begin{bmatrix} n_x^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & n_y^2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & n_z^2 \end{bmatrix}$, where $n_x = 1.5$, $n_y = 1.6$, and $n_z = 1.7$. The crystal is rotated by an angle $\theta = 30^\circ$ about the y-axis. A light beam propagates along the z-axis in the original coordinate system. Determine the $x'z'$ component of the permittivity tensor ($\epsilon_{x'z'}$) in the rotated coordinate system.
</question>

**Critique:**
This question has significant issues with phrasing, clarity, and redundant information.
*   **Models a Physics Scenario:** Yes, tensor transformation due to crystal rotation is a valid physics scenario.
*   **Answers as Numerical Value with SI Units:** Yes.
*   **Forces Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes, requires knowledge of tensor transformation and rotation matrices.
*   **Unique:** Sufficiently unique.
*   **Single Solution:** Yes, assuming correct interpretation.
*   **Rigorous, Concise Phrasing:** **Problematic.**
    *   "anisotropic crystal with a tilted optical axis": This phrasing usually implies the principal axes are *already* not aligned with the (x,y,z) coordinate system. However, the subsequent sentence "The crystal's permittivity tensor in the principal coordinate system is given by $\epsilon' = \dots$" immediately follows, implying the given diagonal tensor *is* in a principal system, which is then *rotated*. This is confusing. The prime notation $\epsilon'$ typically denotes the *rotated* tensor, not the *original* principal one.
    *   It should be explicitly stated: "Consider an anisotropic crystal whose principal axes are initially aligned with the x, y, and z axes. Its permittivity tensor in this principal coordinate system is given by $\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \begin{bmatrix} n_x^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & n_y^2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & n_z^2 \end{bmatrix}$..." and then ask for $\epsilon'_{x'z'}$ in the *new* coordinate system.
*   **All Assumptions Stated, Variables Defined:** The coordinate system setup is unclear due to the phrasing.
*   **Units Consistent, Conventional Notation:** The question asks for $\epsilon_{x'z'}$. Since the input tensor is $\epsilon_0 \times \mathrm{values}$, the answer should also be in terms of $\epsilon_0$ or a numerical value in SI units ($\mathrm{F/m}$). The prompt requires "numerical value with appropriate SI units." So, the final answer should include $\epsilon_0$ multiplied by the calculated numerical value.
*   **Not Multipart:** Solves for a single quantity.
*   **Formatting:** Correct.
*   **Tags:** Correct.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Clarify Initial Setup:** Rephrase the introductory sentences to clearly distinguish between the initial (principal) coordinate system and the new (rotated) coordinate system. For example: "Consider an anisotropic crystal whose principal axes are initially aligned with the x, y, and z axes. Its permittivity tensor in this original principal coordinate system is given by $\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \mathrm{diag}(n_x^2, n_y^2, n_z^2)$..." (remove the prime from the initial tensor).
2.  **Remove Redundancy:** The sentence "A light beam propagates along the z-axis in the original coordinate system" is completely irrelevant to the task of determining a component of the permittivity tensor in a rotated coordinate system. Remove it.
3.  **Specify Answer Units:** Explicitly state whether the answer should be in terms of $\epsilon_0$ (e.g., "$X \cdot \epsilon_0$") or a numerical value in $\mathrm{F/m}$. Given the guidelines, $\mathrm{F/m}$ is preferred.

<question>
A vortex beam with a topological charge of $l=1$ is incident on an anisotropic material. The material's permittivity tensor introduces a phase retardation of $\Delta \phi = \pi/2$ between the x and y components of the electric field. The initial electric field of the vortex beam is given by $E = E_0 (x + iy)e^{-r^2/w_0^2}$, where $E_0$ is the amplitude, $r$ is the radial distance, and $w_0$ is the beam waist. After passing through the anisotropic material, what is the new topological charge $l'$ of the modified vortex beam?
</question>

**Critique:**
This question suffers from a fundamental conceptual inconsistency, making it poorly defined or trivially simple.
*   **Models a Physics Scenario:** Attempts to, by combining vortex beams and anisotropic materials.
*   **Answers as Numerical Value with SI Units:** Yes.
*   **Forces Multi-Step Reasoning:** **Problematic.** The question is ill-posed conceptually.
*   **Unique:** The combination is somewhat unique, but its execution is flawed.
*   **Single Solution:** **Problematic.** Due to ambiguity, the intended answer is unclear. If interpreted literally, the answer is trivial.
*   **Rigorous, Concise Phrasing:** **Problematic.**
    *   "The initial electric field...is given by $E = E_0 (x + iy)e^{-r^2/w_0^2}$": This expression defines a *scalar* field whose phase dependence is $e^{i\phi_{azimuthal}}$ (since $x+iy = r e^{i\phi_{azimuthal}}$), clearly indicating a topological charge $l=1$.
    *   "...introduces a phase retardation of $\Delta \phi = \pi/2$ between the x and y components of the electric field": This refers to the *polarization* state (vector nature) of the electric field. A scalar field ($E$) does not have distinct "x and y components of the electric field" in this context. This is a fundamental inconsistency.
    *   If the initial $E$ *is* meant to be one component (e.g., $E_x$), then there's no initial $E_y$ to be phase-shifted, unless it's implicitly zero, in which case the problem makes little sense for determining $l'$.
    *   If the incident light is a vector field $\vec{E} = E_0 (x+iy) \hat{e} e^{-r^2/w_0^2}$ (where $\hat{e}$ is a constant polarization vector), then the anisotropic material (acting as a waveplate) only modifies the polarization state $\hat{e}$, not the spatial phase winding $(x+iy)$. Thus, the topological charge $l$ would remain $1$. This makes the problem either trivial (if the expected answer is $l'=1$) or the "phase retardation" information is a distractor, which violates the "multi-step reasoning" guideline.
    *   To alter the topological charge ($l$) using an anisotropic material, a more complex interaction is required, such as a q-plate (which couples polarization spin to orbital angular momentum), not a simple phase retardation from a standard linear birefringent material.
*   **All Assumptions Stated, Variables Defined:** The definition of the electric field is contradictory.
*   **Units Consistent, Conventional Notation:** Yes.
*   **Not Multipart:** Solves for a single quantity.
*   **Formatting:** Correct.
*   **Tags:** Correct.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Redefine Electric Field:** Clarify the nature of the initial electric field. If it's a vector field, specify its components, e.g., $\vec{E}(x,y) = E_0 (x+iy) \hat{x} e^{-r^2/w_0^2} + E_0 (x+iy) \hat{y} e^{-r^2/w_0^2}$.
2.  **Ensure Conceptual Consistency:** If the intent is for the topological charge to change, the interaction with the anisotropic material must be specified to be one that actually *converts* orbital angular momentum or couples spin angular momentum to orbital angular momentum (e.g., using a q-plate or non-linear effects), rather than a simple phase retardation (which only changes polarization). As currently phrased, a standard birefringent material would not change $l$.
3.  **Avoid Triviality or Ambiguity:** If the question intends a change in $l$, it needs a more complex, well-defined interaction. If $l$ is not supposed to change, the problem becomes trivial for advanced learners, and the $\Delta\phi$ information is a distractor without a clear reason for its inclusion.

The crystal is then rotated by an angle $\theta = 30^\circ$ about the y-axis.

<question>
A uniaxial anisotropic crystal with its optical axis (OA) aligned along the z-axis has ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices of $n_o = 1.5$ and $n_e = 1.7$, respectively. A linearly polarized light beam with wavelength $\lambda = 633 \, \mathrm{nm}$ propagates through the crystal along the y-axis. The incident light is polarized at 45 degrees with respect to the z-axis.

</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Excellent. A classic setup of birefringence in an anisotropic crystal.
*   **Guideline 2 (Expect answers as symbolic/numerical):** Excellent. Expects a single numerical value with units.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Good. Requires identifying ordinary/extraordinary modes for the given propagation direction, calculating effective refractive indices for these modes, determining the optical path difference, and converting to phase difference.
*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** Good. While the concept is standard, the specific geometry (y-propagation, 45-degree polarization) and numerical values create a unique problem.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** Excellent. Yields a single correct numerical answer.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Good. Clear and professional.
*   **Guideline 7 (All assumptions/variables defined):** Good. All parameters are clearly defined.
*   **Guideline 8 (Units consistent, conventional notation):** Excellent. Units are consistent, and notation is standard.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not multipart):** Excellent. Focuses on a single target quantity.
*   **Guideline 10 (Formatting):** Excellent. Correct LaTeX with Markdown and `<question>` tags.

**Actionable Feedback:**

*   **Redundancy:** The explicit inclusion of the permittivity tensor $\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \begin{bmatrix} n_o^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & n_o^2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & n_e^2 \end{bmatrix}$ is redundant. The problem statement "uniaxial anisotropic crystal with its optical axis (OA) aligned along the z-axis has ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices of $n_o = 1.5$ and $n_e = 1.7$" already implicitly defines this tensor and its components. Providing the tensor gives away a conceptual step where the student should deduce the principal refractive indices from the crystal's description.

**Improvement:** Remove the last sentence stating the permittivity tensor. The current description is sufficient.

An anisotropic metamaterial slab exhibits in-plane anisotropy in the xy-plane. The permittivity tensor describing the response to electric fields in the xy plane for a wave propagating along the z-axis is given by $\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}$. A transverse electric (TE) polarized wave is incident normally on the slab. Calculate the two effective refractive indices experienced by the two polarization eigenmodes of the TE mode in this anisotropic material. Assume the relative permeability $\mu_r = 1$.
</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Excellent. A modern scenario involving metamaterials and anisotropic propagation.
*   **Guideline 2 (Expect answers as symbolic/numerical):** Excellent. Expects two numerical values.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Excellent. Requires diagonalizing the given permittivity tensor, finding the eigenvalues (which correspond to squared effective refractive indices), and then taking the square root to find the refractive indices.
*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** Excellent. The specific tensor and context make it a novel problem.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** Excellent. Yields two specific numerical values.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Good. Clear and professional.
*   **Guideline 7 (All assumptions/variables defined):** Good. The tensor and $\mu_r$ are defined. "TE polarized wave" is clear in context of z-propagation.
*   **Guideline 8 (Units consistent, conventional notation):** Excellent. Refractive indices are dimensionless, and notation is standard.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not multipart):** Excellent. Focuses on a single target quantity (the two refractive indices).
*   **Guideline 10 (Formatting):** Excellent. Correct LaTeX with Markdown and `<question>` tags.

**Actionable Feedback:**

*   **Clarity of Tensor Context:** The phrase "The permittivity tensor describing the response to electric fields in the xy plane for a wave propagating along the z-axis is given by..." is slightly verbose. While correct, it implies that this $2 \times 2$ matrix is a sub-block of a larger $3 \times 3$ tensor. For clarity and conciseness, you can rephrase it.

**Improvement:** Rephrase the sentence describing the permittivity tensor: "For a wave propagating along the z-axis in an anisotropic metamaterial, the relevant permittivity tensor for the electric field components in the xy-plane is given by $\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}$."

A chiral material is characterized by a permittivity tensor with off-diagonal elements that introduce optical activity. The permittivity tensor is approximated as $\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \begin{bmatrix} n^2 & i\delta \\ -i\delta & n^2 \end{bmatrix}$, where $n = 1.5$ is the average refractive index and $\delta = 0.01$ represents the chirality parameter. A linearly polarized light beam with wavelength $\lambda = 532 \, \mathrm{nm}$ is incident on a slab of this material with thickness $d = 1 \, \mathrm{mm}$. Calculate the angle of rotation $\theta$ (in degrees) of the polarization direction of the light after passing through the chiral material.
</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Excellent. A good scenario for optical activity.
*   **Guideline 2 (Expect answers as symbolic/numerical):** Excellent. Expects a single numerical value with units.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Good. Requires finding the eigenvalues of the tensor (which correspond to effective refractive indices for circular polarizations), calculating the phase difference between these modes, and then relating it to the rotation angle.
*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** Good. The specific tensor form for a chiral material is a good way to test understanding of optical activity.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** Excellent. Yields a single numerical answer.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Good. Clear and professional.
*   **Guideline 7 (All assumptions/variables defined):** Good. All parameters are clearly defined.
*   **Guideline 8 (Units consistent, conventional notation):** Excellent. Units are consistent, and notation is standard.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not multipart):** Excellent. Focuses on a single target quantity.
*   **Guideline 10 (Formatting):** Excellent. Correct LaTeX with Markdown and `<question>` tags.

**Actionable Feedback:**

*   **Missing Information (Propagation Direction):** This is a critical omission. The given $2 \times 2$ permittivity tensor for "chiral material" implies it's relevant for electric field components in a specific plane transverse to the propagation direction. Without stating the propagation direction (e.g., along the z-axis), the student cannot correctly set up the eigenvalue problem or relate the tensor to the ordinary/extraordinary modes. For optical activity, light typically propagates along an axis where the transverse plane response is described by such a tensor.

**Improvement:** Explicitly state the propagation direction. For example: "A linearly polarized light beam with wavelength $\lambda = 532 \, \mathrm{nm}$ propagates along the z-axis and is incident normally on a slab of this material with thickness $d = 1 \, \mathrm{mm}$."

Determine the $x'z'$ component of the permittivity tensor ($\epsilon_{x'z'}$) in the rotated coordinate system, expressed in units of Farads per meter (F/m).

A q-plate is an anisotropic material that couples the polarization spin of light to its orbital angular momentum. Consider a q-plate designed to convert an incident vortex beam with a topological charge of $l = 1$ and right-circular polarization (RCP) into a beam with left-circular polarization (LCP). After passing through the q-plate, what is the new topological charge $l'$ of the modified vortex beam? (Hint: a q-plate swaps the spin and orbital angular momentum.)
</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Excellent. A modern and conceptually advanced scenario involving light's angular momentum.
*   **Guideline 2 (Expect answers as symbolic/numerical):** Excellent. Expects a single numerical value.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Good. Requires understanding spin angular momentum for circular polarizations, interpreting the q-plate's action, and applying the hint.
*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** Excellent. The q-plate context makes this problem highly unique and relevant to modern optics.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** Potentially problematic due to contradiction in hint.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Good, but the hint introduces an issue.
*   **Guideline 7 (All assumptions/variables defined):** Good. All parameters are defined.
*   **Guideline 8 (Units consistent, conventional notation):** Excellent. Topological charge is dimensionless, and notation is standard.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not multipart):** Excellent. Focuses on a single target quantity.
*   **Guideline 10 (Formatting):** Excellent. Correct LaTeX with Markdown and `<question>` tags.

**Actionable Feedback:**

*   **Contradictory Hint:** The most significant flaw is the hint: "(Hint: a q-plate swaps the spin and orbital angular momentum.)" This hint, when applied literally, contradicts the explicit polarization change stated in the problem.
    *   Initial state: $l_{in} = 1$, $S_{in} = +1$ (for RCP, in units of $\hbar$).
    *   Final state: $S_{out} = -1$ (for LCP).
    *   If the q-plate "swaps" the values, then $l_{out}$ would be $S_{in} = +1$, and $S_{out}$ would be $l_{in} = +1$. However, the problem explicitly states $S_{out} = -1$. This inconsistency makes the problem unsolvable as stated, as the hint guides to a solution that contradicts the given output polarization.
    *   A typical q-plate of charge $q$ transforms $l \rightarrow l \pm 2q$ and flips the polarization. For an RCP input ($S=+1$) converting to LCP ($S=-1$), the OAM usually changes by $\Delta l = +2q$. To solve this problem, one would need to know the q-plate's charge ($q$) or have a consistent mechanism described. The current "swap" hint is problematic.

**Improvement:** Either remove the hint entirely and specify the q-plate's charge $q$ (e.g., "a q-plate with $q=1/2$"), or precisely redefine the "swapping" mechanism so it is consistent with the given input/output polarization states. For example, "A q-plate converts the initial spin angular momentum to orbital angular momentum, and flips the sign of the spin angular momentum, where its magnitude is determined by the initial orbital angular momentum." (This is still a non-standard description, but at least consistent). The simplest fix is to remove the hint and provide $q$.

A uniaxial anisotropic crystal with its optical axis (OA) aligned along the z-axis has ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices of $n_o = 1.5$ and $n_e = 1.7$, respectively. A linearly polarized light beam with wavelength $\lambda = 633 \, \mathrm{nm}$ propagates through the crystal along the y-axis. The incident light is polarized at 45 degrees with respect to the z-axis. If the crystal thickness is $d = 10 \, \mu\mathrm{m}$, determine the phase difference $\Delta \phi$ (in radians) between the ordinary and extraordinary waves after traversing the crystal.

For a wave propagating along the z-axis in an anisotropic metamaterial, the relevant permittivity tensor for the electric field components in the xy-plane is given by $\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}$. A transverse electric (TE) polarized wave is incident normally on the metamaterial. Calculate the two effective refractive indices experienced by the two polarization eigenmodes of the TE mode in this anisotropic material. Assume the relative permeability $\mu_r = 1$.

A chiral material is characterized by a permittivity tensor with off-diagonal elements that introduce optical activity. The permittivity tensor is approximated as $\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \begin{bmatrix} n^2 & i\delta \\ -i\delta & n^2 \end{bmatrix}$, where $n = 1.5$ is the average refractive index and $\delta = 0.01$ represents the chirality parameter. A linearly polarized light beam with wavelength $\lambda = 532 \, \mathrm{nm}$ propagates along the z-axis and is incident normally on a slab of this material with thickness $d = 1 \, \mathrm{mm}$. Calculate the angle of rotation $\theta$ (in degrees) of the polarization direction of the light after passing through the chiral material.

Consider an anisotropic crystal whose principal axes are initially aligned with the x, y, and z axes. Its permittivity tensor in this original principal coordinate system is given by $\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \begin{bmatrix} n_x^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & n_y^2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & n_z^2 \end{bmatrix}$, where $n_x = 1.5$, $n_y = 1.6$, and $n_z = 1.7$. The crystal is then rotated by an angle $\theta = 30^\circ$ about the y-axis. Determine the $x'z'$ component of the permittivity tensor ($\epsilon_{x'z'}$) in the rotated coordinate system, expressed in units of Farads per meter (F/m).
