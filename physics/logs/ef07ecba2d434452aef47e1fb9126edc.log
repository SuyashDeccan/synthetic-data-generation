Consider an interferometer employing NOON states to measure an unknown phase shift $\phi$. The input state is a NOON state of the form $|\psi_{in}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|N,0\rangle + |0,N\rangle)$, where $N$ represents the number of photons. Due to imperfections in the optical elements, each photon experiences a probability $p = 0.1$ of being lost before reaching the detector. Assuming the loss affects each photon independently and that the phase shift $\phi$ is introduced in one arm of the interferometer before detection, calculate the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) for estimating $\phi$ in the presence of this photon loss, given $N=4$. Express your answer as a numerical value.

An interferometer is used to estimate a phase shift $\phi$ with an entangled coherent state (ECS) input. The ECS is prepared as $|\psi\rangle = \mathcal{N}(|\alpha\rangle_A|\alpha\rangle_B + |-\alpha\rangle_A|-\alpha\rangle_B)$, where $|\alpha\rangle$ represents a coherent state with amplitude $\alpha$, $A$ and $B$ denote the two arms of the interferometer, and $\mathcal{N}$ is a normalization factor.  Assume that due to atmospheric turbulence, a random phase fluctuation $\theta$ is introduced, which is uniformly distributed between $-\Delta\theta/2$ and $+\Delta\theta/2$ in both arms of the interferometer. Considering that the average phase estimation $\langle \phi \rangle$ is now affected by the shared random phase, calculate the reduction factor in the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) for estimating $\phi$ after averaging over the random phase $\theta$, relative to the QFI without phase averaging. Assume $\alpha = 2$ and $\Delta\theta = \pi/4$. Give the reduction factor as a numerical value.

Here's a critique of each question based on the provided guidelines:

---

**Question 1 Critique:**

*   **2. Expect answers as symbolic or numerical:** A numerical value is requested, which is appropriate for a specific calculation.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes. Calculating QFI for a NOON state with independent photon loss involves transforming the pure state into a mixed state (density matrix), then applying the QFI formula for mixed states. This requires several steps of quantum mechanics and information theory.
*   **4. Be Unique:** While NOON states and photon loss are standard topics, the specific parameters and the nature of the loss (independent loss for each photon) make this problem distinct from typical textbook examples.
*   **5. Single Solution:** Yes, the QFI will yield a single numerical value.
*   **6. Rigorous, Concise Phrasing:** The phrasing is clear, professional, and free of hints.
*   **7. All assumptions clearly stated, all variables defined:** The input state, $N$, photon loss probability $p$, independence of loss, and location of phase shift are all clearly stated.
    *   *Minor Improvement:* For absolute clarity, one could specify that $N$ represents the *total* number of photons in the NOON state, though this is conventionally understood.
*   **8. Units consistent; numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional physics notation:** QFI is dimensionless, so no SI units are applicable for the answer. All symbols ($N, p, \phi$) are standard.
*   **9. Questions must not be multipart:** It asks for a single quantity (QFI).
*   **10. Question Formatting:**
    *   The use of inline math (`$\phi$`, `$|\psi_{in}\rangle$`, etc.) is correct.
    *   However, numerical values like `0.1` and `4` are *not* enclosed in dollar signs as per the strict interpretation of guideline 11 ("all inline math, numbers, variables are enclosed by $...$").

**Actionable Feedback:**
*   **Formatting:** Enclose all numerical values (e.g., $0.1$, $4$) in dollar signs, even when they appear as standalone numbers or in assignments (e.g., `probability $p = 0.1$` and `given $N=4$`).

*   **4. Be Unique:** Entangled coherent states are less common than NOON states in introductory contexts, and adding shared random phase noise makes this a novel and challenging problem.
*   **5. Single Solution:** Yes, a single numerical reduction factor.
*   **6. Rigorous, Concise Phrasing:** The phrasing is professional and clear.
    *   *Minor Improvement:* The sentence "Considering that the average phase estimation $\langle \phi \rangle$ is now affected by the shared random phase" could be removed for maximum conciseness, as it's somewhat explanatory and potentially a minor hint. The core task is clear without it.
*   **7. All assumptions clearly stated, all variables defined:** The input state, normalization factor, coherent state definition, random phase $\theta$ distribution, and location of noise are all defined.
*   **8. Units consistent; numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional physics notation:** The reduction factor is dimensionless. All symbols ($\phi, \alpha, \theta, \Delta\theta$) are standard.
*   **9. Questions must not be multipart:** It asks for a single quantity (reduction factor).
*   **10. Question Formatting:**
    *   All math and variables are correctly formatted using dollar signs.
    *   However, the numerical value `2` in `$\alpha = 2$` should also be enclosed in dollar signs separately if it were a standalone number, but here it is part of an equation which is already in math mode, so it's acceptable.

<question>
An interferometer employing coherent states is used for estimating an unknown phase $\phi$. The input state to the interferometer is a two-mode coherent state $|\alpha, \alpha\rangle$, where each mode has an average photon number $|\alpha|^2$. However, one of the arms of the interferometer suffers from photon loss described by a beamsplitter with transmittance $T = $0.75$. Calculate the Quantum Cram√©r-Rao bound on the variance of the phase estimation, $\Delta\phi^2$, assuming $|\alpha|^2 = $4$ and using Quantum Fisher Information as the figure of merit. Present the result as a numerical value.
