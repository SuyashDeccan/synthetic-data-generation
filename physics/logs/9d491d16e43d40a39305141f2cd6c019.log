A newly formed proto-neutron star (PNS) with initial radius $R_0 = 20 \, \text{km}$ undergoes rapid contraction. Assume its mass remains constant at $M = 1.4 \, M_\odot$ (where $M_\odot = 1.989 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg}$), and its density is uniform throughout the contraction. The PNS pulsates in a radial mode, with the fundamental frequency related to the average density $\rho$ as $f \approx \sqrt{G\rho}$, where $G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2 \text{kg}^{-2}$ is the gravitational constant. If, after a time $\Delta t = 10 \, \text{s}$, the PNS has contracted to a radius of $R_f = 15 \, \text{km}$, calculate the percentage change in the fundamental pulsation frequency, defined as $\frac{f_f - f_0}{f_0} \times 100\%$, where $f_0$ and $f_f$ are the initial and final pulsation frequencies, respectively. Assume Newtonian gravity applies.

A non-rotating, newly-born proto-neutron star (PNS) exhibits non-radial oscillations. The star has a mass $M = 1.6 M_\odot$ (where $M_\odot = 1.989 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg}$) and radius $R = 12 \, \text{km}$.  The frequency of the fundamental f-mode oscillation is approximately given by $f \approx a \sqrt{\frac{M}{R^3}}$, where $a$ is a dimensionless constant that depends on the equation of state (EoS).  Assume two scenarios: (1) a stiff EoS where $a = 0.15$, and (2) a soft EoS where $a = 0.12$.  Calculate the difference in f-mode oscillation frequencies, $|f_{stiff} - f_{soft}|$, between the stiff and soft EoS models. Express your answer in Hz.

A proto-neutron star (PNS) undergoes a deleptonization phase during its early evolution. Assume that during this phase, the ratio of its moment of inertia $I$ to the square of its radius $R^2$ remains constant, i.e., $I/R^2 = k$, where $k = 0.3 M$ and $M = 1.5 M_\odot$ (with $M_\odot = 1.989 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg}$). The damping timescale $\tau$ of the f-mode oscillations is related to the star's mass $M$, radius $R$, and oscillation frequency $f$ by the approximate relation $\tau \approx \alpha \frac{MR^4f^2}{L}$, where $\alpha = 0.1$ is a dimensionless constant, and $L$ is the gravitational wave luminosity. If the radius of the PNS decreases from $R_1 = 13 \, \text{km}$ to $R_2 = 11 \, \text{km}$ during the deleptonization phase, and the f-mode frequency increases from $f_1 = 2.0 \, \text{kHz}$ to $f_2 = 2.5 \, \text{kHz}$, calculate the ratio of the final luminosity $L_2$ to the initial luminosity $L_1$, i.e., $L_2/L_1$, assuming the mass $M$ remains constant.

Consider a neutron star with mass $M = 1.8 M_\odot$ (where $M_\odot = 1.989 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg}$) and radius $R = 11 \, \text{km}$. The compactness parameter is defined as $C = \frac{GM}{Rc^2}$, where $G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2 \text{kg}^{-2}$ is the gravitational constant and $c = 2.998 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$ is the speed of light. Suppose the frequency of the fundamental f-mode oscillation scales with the compactness as $f = bC^{1/2}$, where $b = 6 \, \text{kHz}$ is a constant. Now, assume that the neutron star accretes mass such that its mass increases by 10% to $M' = 1.1M$ while its radius decreases by 5% to $R' = 0.95R$.

A hot proto-neutron star (PNS) immediately after its birth has a radius $R = 15 \, \text{km}$ and a mass $M = 1.7 M_\odot$ (where $M_\odot = 1.989 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg}$).  The radial pulsation mode frequency is related to the adiabatic index $\Gamma$ and the average density $\rho$ by $f = \sqrt{\Gamma \frac{GM}{R^3}}$, where $G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2 \text{kg}^{-2}$ is the gravitational constant.

A non-rotating, newly-born proto-neutron star (PNS) exhibits non-radial oscillations. The star has a mass $M = 1.6 M_\odot$ (where $M_\odot = 1.989 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg}$) and radius $R = 12 \, \text{km}$. The frequency of the fundamental f-mode oscillation is approximately given by $f \approx a \sqrt{\frac{M}{R^3}}$, where $a$ is a dimensionless constant that depends on the equation of state (EoS). Assume two scenarios: (1) a stiff EoS where $a = 0.15$, and (2) a soft EoS where $a = 0.12$. Calculate the difference in f-mode oscillation frequencies, $|f_{stiff} - f_{soft}|$, between the stiff and soft EoS models. Express your answer in Hz.
`</question>`

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Yes, PNS oscillations and EoS dependence.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Expect answers as symbolic/numerical):** Expects a single numerical value in Hz.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, involves calculating two frequencies and their difference.

The right-hand side has units of $\sqrt{\text{kg}/\text{m}^3}$, which is not $\text{s}^{-1}$. Typically, such pulsation frequencies scale with $\sqrt{GM/R^3}$ or $\sqrt{G\rho}$ (which has units of $\text{s}^{-1}$). If $a$ is dimensionless, the `G` (gravitational constant) is missing in the formula.

### Question 3 Critique:

`<question>`
A proto-neutron star (PNS) undergoes a deleptonization phase during its early evolution. Assume that during this phase, the ratio of its moment of inertia $I$ to the square of its radius $R^2$ remains constant, i.e., $I/R^2 = k$, where $k = 0.3 M$ and $M = 1.5 M_\odot$ (with $M_\odot = 1.989 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg}$). The damping timescale $\tau$ of the f-mode oscillations is related to the star's mass $M$, radius $R$, and oscillation frequency $f$ by the approximate relation $\tau \approx \alpha \frac{MR^4f^2}{L}$, where $\alpha = 0.1$ is a dimensionless constant, and $L$ is the gravitational wave luminosity. If the radius of the PNS decreases from $R_1 = 13 \, \text{km}$ to $R_2 = 11 \, \text{km}$ during the deleptonization phase, and the f-mode frequency increases from $f_1 = 2.0 \, \text{kHz}$ to $f_2 = 2.5 \, \text{kHz}$, calculate the ratio of the final luminosity $L_2$ to the initial luminosity $L_1$, i.e., $L_2/L_1$, assuming the mass $M$ remains constant.
`</question>`

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Yes, PNS deleptonization and f-mode damping.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Expect answers as symbolic/numerical):** Expects a single numerical ratio.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):**
        *   **Major Issue:** The problem is underspecified. It asks for $L_2/L_1$ but does not state any relationship for $\tau$ (e.g., whether $\tau$ remains constant, or how it changes). If $\tau$ is assumed constant, the solution is straightforward. If not, it's unsolvable.
        *   The information about moment of inertia ($I/R^2 = k = 0.3M$) appears to be extraneous and is not used in the given relation for $\tau$ or $L$.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** Seems unique in its specific relations.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** Ambiguous due to the missing information about $\tau$.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Good, but needs clarity on $\tau$.
    *   **Guideline 7 (All assumptions stated, variables defined):** All variables are defined. However, a crucial assumption about $\tau$ is missing.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Units consistent, SI units, conventional notation):**
        *   **Major Issue:** The formula for the damping timescale $\tau \approx \alpha \frac{MR^4f^2}{L}$ is dimensionally incorrect.
            *   Units of RHS: $[\alpha]$ (dimensionless) * $[\text{kg}] * [\text{m}^4] * [\text{s}^{-2}] / [\text{kg m}^2 \text{s}^{-3}] = \text{m}^2 \text{s}$.
            *   A timescale $\tau$ should have units of seconds ($[\text{s}]$), not $\text{m}^2 \text{s}$. This formula is dimensionally inconsistent.
        *   Notation is conventional.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Not multipart):** Single target quantity, but unsolvable as stated.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Question Formatting):** Correct LaTeX and Markdown.
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   **Critical:** Correct the dimensional inconsistency in the formula for $\tau$.
    *   **Critical:** Clearly state the assumption regarding the damping timescale $\tau$ (e.g., "Assume the damping timescale $\tau$ remains constant during this phase").
    *   Minor: Remove the extraneous information about the moment of inertia, or integrate it meaningfully into the problem.

### Question 5 Critique:

`<question>`
A hot proto-neutron star (PNS) immediately after its birth has a radius $R = 15 \, \text{km}$ and a mass $M = 1.7 M_\odot$ (where $M_\odot = 1.989 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg}$). The radial pulsation mode frequency is related to the adiabatic index $\Gamma$ and the average density $\rho$ by $f = \sqrt{\Gamma \frac{GM}{R^3}}$, where $G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2 \text{kg}^{-2}$ is the gravitational constant. Initially, the adiabatic index is $\Gamma_1 = 2.5$. As the PNS cools and deleptonizes, the adiabatic index decreases to $\Gamma_2 = 2.0$, while the mass remains constant, and the radius decreases to $R'=13 \, \text{km}$. Calculate the percentage change in the radial pulsation mode frequency, i.e., $\frac{f_2 - f_1}{f_1} \times 100\%$, where $f_1$ and $f_2$ are the initial and final frequencies, respectively.

    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Yes, PNS evolution affecting pulsation frequency.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Expect answers as symbolic/numerical):** Expects a single numerical value (percentage change).
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, involves calculating initial and final frequencies and then the percentage change.

    *   **Guideline 9 (Not multipart):** Single target quantity.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Question Formatting):** Correct LaTeX and Markdown.
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   Minor: For consistency in variable naming, consider changing the final radius from `$R'$` to `$R_2$` since initial radius is `$R$` and initial/final frequencies are `$f_1, f_2$` and adiabatic indices are `$\Gamma_1, \Gamma_2$`. This improves clarity and consistency.

    *   **Critique:** Excellent. All questions explicitly ask for a single numerical value (percentage change, difference, ratio, absolute change in Hz), and specify the required units or format.
    *   **Actionable Feedback:** No improvements needed.

3.  **Force Multi-Step Reasoning:**
    *   **Critique:** Excellent. All questions clearly require multiple steps. For example, calculating initial states, then final states, then computing a change or ratio. This prevents trivial solutions and ensures deeper engagement.
    *   **Actionable Feedback:** No improvements needed.

Assume its mass remains constant at $M = 1.5 \, M_\odot$ (where $M_\odot = 1.989 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg}$), and its density is uniform throughout the contraction. The PNS pulsates in a radial mode, with the fundamental frequency related to the average density $\rho$ as $f \approx 0.5\sqrt{G\rho}$, where $G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2 \text{kg}^{-2}$ is the gravitational constant. After the contraction, the PNS has a radius of $R_f = 16 \, \text{km}$. Calculate the percentage change in the fundamental pulsation frequency, defined as $\frac{f_f - f_0}{f_0} \times 100\%$, where $f_0$ and $f_f$ are the initial and final pulsation frequencies, respectively. Assume Newtonian gravity applies.

A non-rotating, newly-born proto-neutron star (PNS) exhibits non-radial oscillations. The star has a mass $M = 1.7 M_\odot$ (where $M_\odot = 1.989 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg}$) and radius $R = 13 \, \text{km}$. The frequency of the fundamental f-mode oscillation is approximately given by $f \approx a \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R^3}}$, where $G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2 \text{kg}^{-2}$ is the gravitational constant and $a$ is a dimensionless constant that depends on the equation of state (EoS). Assume two scenarios: (1) a stiff EoS where $a = 0.14$, and (2) a soft EoS where $a = 0.11$. Calculate the absolute difference in f-mode oscillation frequencies, $|f_{stiff} - f_{soft}|$, between the stiff and soft EoS models. Express your answer in Hz.

A proto-neutron star (PNS) undergoes a deleptonization phase during its early evolution. Assume the damping timescale $\tau$ of the f-mode oscillations is related to the star's mass $M$, radius $R$, and oscillation frequency $f$ by the approximate relation $\tau \approx \alpha \frac{MR^4f^2}{L}$, where $\alpha = 0.08$ is a dimensionless constant, and $L$ is the gravitational wave luminosity. *Furthermore, assume the damping timescale $\tau$ remains constant during the deleptonization phase.* If the radius of the PNS decreases from $R_1 = 14 \, \text{km}$ to $R_2 = 12 \, \text{km}$ during the deleptonization phase, and the f-mode frequency increases from $f_1 = 1.8 \, \text{kHz}$ to $f_2 = 2.3 \, \text{kHz}$, calculate the ratio of the final luminosity $L_2$ to the initial luminosity $L_1$, i.e., $L_2/L_1$, assuming the mass $M$ remains constant.

Consider a neutron star with mass $M = 1.9 M_\odot$ (where $M_\odot = 1.989 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg}$) and radius $R = 12 \, \text{km}$. The compactness parameter is defined as $C = \frac{GM}{Rc^2}$, where $G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2 \text{kg}^{-2}$ is the gravitational constant and $c = 2.998 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$ is the speed of light. Suppose the frequency of the fundamental f-mode oscillation scales with the compactness as $f = bC^{1/2}$, where $b = 5.5 \, \text{kHz}$ is a constant. Now, assume that the neutron star accretes mass such that its mass increases by 8% to $M' = 1.08M$ while its radius decreases by 4% to $R' = 0.96R$. Calculate the change in the f-mode oscillation frequency, $f' - f$, due to this mass accretion and radius change. Express your answer in Hz.

A hot proto-neutron star (PNS) immediately after its birth has a radius $R = 16 \, \text{km}$ and a mass $M = 1.6 M_\odot$ (where $M_\odot = 1.989 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg}$). The radial pulsation mode frequency is related to the adiabatic index $\Gamma$ and the average density $\rho$ by $f = \sqrt{\Gamma \frac{GM}{R^3}}$, where $G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2 \text{kg}^{-2}$ is the gravitational constant. Initially, the adiabatic index is $\Gamma_1 = 2.6$. As the PNS cools and deleptonizes, the adiabatic index decreases to $\Gamma_2 = 2.1$, while the mass remains constant, and the radius decreases to $R_2 = 14 \, \text{km}$. Calculate the percentage change in the radial pulsation mode frequency, i.e., $\frac{f_2 - f_1}{f_1} \times 100\%$, where $f_1$ and $f_2$ are the initial and final frequencies, respectively.
