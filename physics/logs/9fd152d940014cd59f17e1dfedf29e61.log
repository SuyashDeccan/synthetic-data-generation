Consider Higgs boson pair production at the LHC. The amplitude for a particular Feynman diagram contributing to this process contains a form factor $F(s, m_H, m_t)$, where $s$ is the center-of-mass energy squared, $m_H$ is the Higgs boson mass ($125 \, \text{GeV}$), and $m_t$ is the top quark mass ($173 \, \text{GeV}$). Assume that after decomposition using computer algebra tools, this form factor can be expressed as a linear combination of multiple polylogarithms (MPLs) and transcendental constants. Specifically, the leading term in the large $m_t$ expansion is given by:
$$F(s, m_H, m_t) \approx A \cdot \text{Li}_2\left(-\frac{s}{m_H^2}\right) + B \cdot \ln^2\left(\frac{s}{m_H^2}\right) + C \cdot \zeta_2$$,
where $\text{Li}_2(x)$ is the dilogarithm function, $\ln(x)$ is the natural logarithm, $\zeta_2 = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$, and $A, B, C$ are numerical coefficients obtained after fitting the DiffExp result with the polylogarithmic representation. If $A = 0.5$, $B = -0.25$, and $C = 0.1$, and $s = (500 \, \text{GeV})^2$, numerically evaluate $F(s, m_H, m_t)$ (the approximate expression). Give your answer as a complex number.

A two-loop scattering amplitude in a quantum field theory calculation involves a divergent integral that can be regularized using dimensional regularization. After applying integration-by-parts (IBP) reduction using computer algebra tools like Kira, the amplitude can be expressed in terms of a set of master integrals. Suppose one of the master integrals, $I(\epsilon)$, has a Laurent expansion in the dimensional regularization parameter $\epsilon$ of the form:
$$I(\epsilon) = \frac{a_{-2}}{\epsilon^2} + \frac{a_{-1}}{\epsilon} + a_0 + a_1 \epsilon + a_2 \epsilon^2 + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^3)$$,
where the coefficients $a_i$ are combinations of transcendental numbers and kinematic variables.  Specifically, let $a_{-2} = 1$, $a_{-1} = \gamma_E - \ln(4\pi)$, where $\gamma_E$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant ($\approx 0.57721$), and $a_0 = \zeta_2$. Evaluate $I(\epsilon)$ numerically for $\epsilon = 0.01$.

Consider a specific form factor, $G(s,t,m^2)$, appearing in the calculation of electroweak corrections to Higgs boson pair production. This form factor is a function of Mandelstam variables $s$ and $t$, and the mass $m$. Assume that the form factor admits a representation in terms of multiple polylogarithms. After using computer algebra tools (e.g., FireFly, LiteRed), the form factor can be expressed as:
$$G(s,t,m^2) = c_1 \cdot \text{Li}_2\left(\frac{s}{m^2}\right) + c_2 \cdot \text{Li}_2\left(\frac{t}{m^2}\right) + c_3 \cdot \ln\left(-\frac{s}{m^2}\right)\ln\left(-\frac{t}{m^2}\right) + c_4$$,

<question>
Consider Higgs boson pair production at the LHC. The amplitude for a particular Feynman diagram contributing to this process contains a form factor $F(s, m_H, m_t)$, where $s$ is the center-of-mass energy squared, $m_H$ is the Higgs boson mass ($125 \, \text{GeV}$), and $m_t$ is the top quark mass ($173 \, \text{GeV}$). Assume that after decomposition using computer algebra tools, this form factor can be expressed as a linear combination of multiple polylogarithms (MPLs) and transcendental constants. Specifically, the leading term in the large $m_t$ expansion is given by:

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** While the scenario is highly specific to advanced particle physics, the question primarily tests numerical evaluation of a given mathematical expression, not conceptual understanding or physical reasoning *about the scenario*. It lacks a physics problem that requires interpreting the meaning of the form factor or its expansion.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Expects a numerical value, which is fine. However, "Give your answer as a complex number" is a hint.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** This is a single-step calculation: substitute numerical values into a formula and evaluate. It does not combine multiple physical principles.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** The phrase "Give your answer as a complex number" acts as a hint, telling the student about the nature of the result (likely due to negative arguments in logs/polylogs).
*   **Guideline 8 (Units & Notation):** The form factor $F$ is typically dimensionless. The question asks for a numerical value but doesn't explicitly state that the answer should be dimensionless or have no units.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1.  **Enhance Physical Reasoning (G1, G3):** Instead of just numerical evaluation, ask a question that requires interpreting the form factor. For instance, "Discuss the physical significance of the 'large $m_t$ expansion' in the context of Higgs boson pair production." or "How would the behavior of $F$ change if $s$ approached $m_H^2$?" This would require conceptual understanding beyond calculation.
2.  **Remove Hints (G6):** Delete "Give your answer as a complex number." Let the student determine if the result is complex based on the evaluation.
3.  **Clarify Units (G8):** Add a note that the form factor $F$ is dimensionless and the answer should be a pure number.

A two-loop scattering amplitude in a quantum field theory calculation involves a divergent integral that can be regularized using dimensional regularization. After applying integration-by-parts (IBP) reduction using computer algebra tools like Kira, the amplitude can be expressed in terms of a set of master integrals. Suppose one of the master integrals, $I(\epsilon)$, has a Laurent expansion in the dimensional regularization parameter $\epsilon$ of the form:
$$I(\epsilon) = \frac{a_{-2}}{\epsilon^2} + \frac{a_{-1}}{\epsilon} + a_0 + a_1 \epsilon + a_2 \epsilon^2 + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^3)$$,
where the coefficients $a_i$ are combinations of transcendental numbers and kinematic variables. Specifically, let $a_{-2} = 1$, $a_{-1} = \gamma_E - \ln(4\pi)$, where $\gamma_E$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant ($\approx 0.57721$), and $a_0 = \zeta_2$. Evaluate $I(\epsilon)$ numerically for $\epsilon = 0.01$.
</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Similar to Q1, the scenario is authentic to advanced QFT, but the task is purely numerical substitution. It doesn't ask for any physical interpretation of the divergences, regularization, or the master integral itself.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** This is a direct substitution and calculation. It doesn't involve multiple physical principles or analytical steps beyond arithmetic.
*   **Guideline 8 (Units & Notation):** The master integral $I(\epsilon)$ typically has a specific mass dimension depending on its origin, or it can be dimensionless. The question doesn't specify this, though for numerical evaluation with dimensionless $\epsilon$, the result will be a pure number.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1.  **Enhance Physical Reasoning (G1, G3):** To make it a physics question, ask about the *physical significance* of the divergent terms ($a_{-2}/\epsilon^2$, $a_{-1}/\epsilon$). For example: "In the context of renormalization, what role do the $\epsilon^{-2}$ and $\epsilon^{-1}$ terms play in ensuring that physical observables are finite?" This tests understanding of renormalization principles.
2.  **Clarify Dimensionality (G8):** Briefly state whether $I(\epsilon)$ is a dimensionless quantity or has specific dimensions, e.g., "Assume $I(\epsilon)$ is a dimensionless quantity."

### **Critique of Question 3**

<question>
Consider a specific form factor, $G(s,t,m^2)$, appearing in the calculation of electroweak corrections to Higgs boson pair production. This form factor is a function of Mandelstam variables $s$ and $t$, and the mass $m$. Assume that the form factor admits a representation in terms of multiple polylogarithms. After using computer algebra tools (e.g., FireFly, LiteRed), the form factor can be expressed as:
$$G(s,t,m^2) = c_1 \cdot \text{Li}_2\left(\frac{s}{m^2}\right) + c_2 \cdot \text{Li}_2\left(\frac{t}{m^2}\right) + c_3 \cdot \ln\left(-\frac{s}{m^2}\right)\ln\left(-\frac{t}{m^2}\right) + c_4$$,
where $\text{Li}_2(x)$ is the dilogarithm function, $\ln(x)$ is the natural logarithm, and $c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4$ are rational coefficients. Let $c_1 = 1$, $c_2 = -1$, $c_3 = 0.5$, and $c_4 = 2$. Given that $s = -4m^2$ and $t = -m^2$, where $m = 100 \, \text{GeV}$, numerically evaluate $G(s,t,m^2)$.
</question>
```

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** This question, like the others, sets a highly specialized physics context but reduces the task to a simple numerical substitution into a provided formula. No conceptual understanding of form factors, Mandelstam variables, or electroweak corrections is tested.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** This is a single-step calculation: plug numbers into a formula and compute. It does not involve multiple physical principles or steps.
*   **Guideline 8 (Units & Notation):** The form factor $G$ is typically dimensionless. The question asks for a numerical value but doesn't explicitly state that the answer should be dimensionless.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1.  **Enhance Physical Reasoning (G1, G3):** Instead of just numerical evaluation, ask about the physical behavior of the form factor. For example: "Discuss the implications of the argument of the logarithm/dilogarithm becoming positive (i.e., $s > 0$ or $t > 0$) in terms of physical cuts or thresholds in the scattering process." This would test understanding of kinematics and analytical properties relevant to form factors.
2.  **Clarify Units (G8):** Add a note that the form factor $G$ is dimensionless and the answer should be a pure number.

### **General Feedback for All Questions:**

*   **Lack of Core Physics Assessment:** All three questions excel at formatting and defining variables. However, they consistently fail to meet the guidelines of requiring multi-step *physical* reasoning, testing conceptual understanding, or offering unique problems that go beyond numerical plug-and-chug. They use advanced physics *context* but reduce the problem to basic arithmetic and function evaluation, which could be assessed in a mathematics course.
*   **"Computer Algebra Tools" Context:** While realistic, the mentions of specific computer algebra tools are flavor text for the student's task. They don't integrate into the problem-solving process.
*   **Improvement Focus:** To genuinely improve these questions as *physics* assessments, modify them to require:
    *   **Interpretation of results:** What do the calculated numbers *mean* physically?
    *   **Analysis of physical limits/regions:** How does the expression behave in different kinematic regions (e.g., near thresholds, high energy limits)?
    *   **Connection to underlying physical principles:** How do these mathematical forms relate to conservation laws, symmetries, or quantum field theory axioms?
    *   **Derivation/Manipulation (even simplified):** Instead of providing the exact formula, ask for a simplified form or a step in its derivation given some physical constraints.

The current questions are excellent for checking if a student can accurately use a numerical computation tool or library for special functions, but they do not assess deeper physics knowledge or problem-solving skills.

Consider Higgs boson pair production at the LHC. The amplitude for a particular Feynman diagram contributing to this process contains a form factor $F(s, m_H, m_t)$, where $s$ is the center-of-mass energy squared, $m_H$ is the Higgs boson mass ($125 \, \text{GeV}$), and $m_t$ is the top quark mass ($173 \, \text{GeV}$).
