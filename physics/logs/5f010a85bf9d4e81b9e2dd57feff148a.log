Calculate the $\chi^2$ value for this single data point comparison, assuming Gaussian uncertainties.</question>

<question>A volunteer computing project is used to generate $10^{10}$ events using the Pythia 8 Monte Carlo event generator to simulate top quark pair production at the Tevatron ($p\bar{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 1.96 \, \mathrm{TeV}$). After event generation, a cut is applied requiring at least one $b$-jet with $p_T > 20 \, \mathrm{GeV}$ and $|\eta| < 2.5$. This cut reduces the number of events passing the selection to $N_{passed} = 3 \times 10^9$. The average time taken to generate a single event on a volunteer's computer is $t_{event} = 0.5 \, \mathrm{s}$. Estimate the total CPU time (in years) used by the volunteer computing project for event generation before the $b$-jet selection cut.</question>

<question>The Herwig 7 Monte Carlo event generator is used to simulate the production of Higgs bosons at the LHC. After a complex detector simulation, the Higgs mass is reconstructed from its decay products. Due to detector resolution effects, the reconstructed Higgs mass, $m_H^{reco}$, follows a Gaussian distribution with a mean equal to the true Higgs mass ($m_H = 125 \, \mathrm{GeV}$) and a standard deviation of $\sigma = 3 \, \mathrm{GeV}$. An analysis requires $m_H^{reco}$ to be within $\pm 2\sigma$ of the true Higgs mass. What fraction of events are expected to pass this mass window cut, assuming a perfect detector simulation aside from the mass resolution effect?</question>

<question>Sherpa is used to simulate the production of $W$ bosons in proton-proton collisions. The simulation predicts a $W$ boson transverse momentum ($p_T$) distribution. To validate this prediction, the simulation is compared to experimental data from the CMS experiment. The experimental data gives a number of events, $N_{data}=100$, within a specific $p_T$ bin. The Sherpa simulation, after being scaled by the integrated luminosity, predicts $N_{MC}=120$ events in the same bin. The total uncertainty on the experimental data is $\Delta N_{data} = \sqrt{N_{data}}$. The uncertainty on the Monte Carlo prediction due to limited statistics is $\Delta N_{MC} = \sqrt{N_{MC}}$. Calculate the $\chi^2$ value for this single bin comparison.</question>

The question is wrapped in `<question>...</question>` tags.

**Overall Feedback:** Excellent. This question provides a good variation of the $\chi^2$ calculation problem, specifically for event counts where uncertainties are often treated as Poissonian.
