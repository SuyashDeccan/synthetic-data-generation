Here are some novel undergraduate-level physics questions based on your criteria:

<question>A hypothetical universe is governed by modified electromagnetism where the force between two static charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ is given by $$F = \frac{q_1 q_2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r^2} \left(1 + \alpha e^{-\lambda r}\right),$$ where $r$ is the distance between the charges, $\alpha$ is a dimensionless constant, and $\lambda$ has units of inverse meters. Consider a spherically symmetric galaxy with a uniform charge density $\rho$ within a radius $R$. Determine the total electric flux through a Gaussian surface of radius $2R$ centered on the galaxy, expressing your answer in terms of $\rho$, $R$, $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and fundamental constants. </question>

<question>A rapidly rotating neutron star with radius $R = 10^4 \, \mathrm{m}$ and mass $M = 2 \times 10^{30} \, \mathrm{kg}$ is emitting gravitational waves. Due to frame-dragging effects near the neutron star, the effective angular momentum $L$ of a test particle in a circular orbit of radius $r$ is modified. Assuming a weak-field approximation where the spacetime metric is described by the Kerr metric to first order in $a/r$ (where $a = J/Mc$ is the Kerr parameter and $J$ is the angular momentum of the neutron star), and considering the neutron star's angular frequency is $\omega$. Calculate the shift $\Delta \Omega$ in the orbital angular frequency $\Omega = \sqrt{GM/r^3}$ of the test particle at a distance $r = 3R$ from the neutron star’s center, due to the neutron star’s rotation. Express your answer in terms of $G$, $M$, $R$, $\omega$, and $c$. Assume that the neutron star is a uniform sphere.</question>

<question>Consider a scalar field $\phi(x)$ with a potential $V(\phi) = \frac{1}{2}m^2 \phi^2 + \frac{\lambda}{4!} \phi^4$ in a de Sitter space with a Hubble parameter $H$. The scalar field undergoes quantum fluctuations during inflation. Assuming the field is initially at $\phi = 0$, and using the stochastic inflation formalism, estimate the variance $\langle \phi^2 \rangle$ of the scalar field after a long period of inflation, when it reaches a statistical equilibrium. Express your answer in terms of $H$ and $m$ (the mass of the scalar field), assuming $m^2 \ll H^2$.</question>

<question>In a strong magnetic field regime, the energy levels of an electron are quantized into Landau levels. Consider an electron confined to a two-dimensional plane in a uniform magnetic field $B$ perpendicular to the plane. The electron has a charge $-e$ and mass $m$. Calculate the density of states $D(E)$ (number of states per unit energy per unit area) for the Landau levels, considering only the lowest Landau level (LLL). Express your answer in terms of $e$, $B$, $h$ (Planck's constant), and fundamental constants.</question>

<question>A modified gravity theory proposes that the effective gravitational constant $G_{eff}$ depends on the local energy density $\rho$ as $G_{eff} = G_0 \left(1 + \beta \frac{\rho}{\rho_c}\right)$, where $G_0$ is the Newtonian gravitational constant, $\beta$ is a dimensionless constant, and $\rho_c$ is a critical density. Consider a galaxy cluster with a mass $M$ and radius $R$ with a uniform mass density. Using the virial theorem, $2K + U = 0$, where $K$ is the kinetic energy and $U$ is the potential energy, estimate the typical velocity $v$ of a galaxy within the cluster, taking into account the modified gravitational constant. Express your answer in terms of $G_0$, $M$, $R$, $\beta$, and $\rho_c$.</question>

<question>A hypothetical universe is governed by modified electromagnetism where the force between two static charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ is given by $$F = \frac{q_1 q_2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r^2} \left(1 + \alpha e^{-\lambda r}\right),$$ where $r$ is the distance between the charges, $\alpha$ is a dimensionless constant, and $\lambda$ has units of inverse meters. Consider a spherically symmetric galaxy with a uniform charge density $\rho$ within a radius $R$. Determine the total electric flux through a Gaussian surface of radius $2R$ centered on the galaxy, expressing your answer in terms of $\rho$, $R$, $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and fundamental constants. </question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Model Physics Scenario):** Satisfied. A clear, hypothetical scenario.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Format):** Satisfied. Symbolic expression expected.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Partially satisfied, but ambiguous. The core issue is the interpretation of "electric flux" and Gauss's Law in a modified electromagnetism. If the force law is modified, the standard form of Gauss's Law ($\Phi = Q_{enc}/\epsilon_0$) *does not directly hold* as it's a consequence of the $1/r^2$ nature of Coulomb's Law. If the student is expected to derive the electric field $\vec{E}$ from this modified force and then calculate $\int \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A}$, it becomes a significantly more complex integral (possibly beyond undergraduate scope without specific techniques). If the intent is for the student to realize the standard Gauss's Law *doesn't* apply, what calculation *is* expected? This ambiguity is the primary flaw.
*   **Guideline 5 (Uniqueness/Novelty):** Satisfied. A novel modification.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Not satisfied. Ambiguous due to the interpretation of Gauss's Law.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing/No Hints):** Phrasing is concise, no obvious hints.
*   **Guideline 8 (Assumptions/Variable Definition):** Satisfied. All variables defined, assumptions stated.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units/Notation):** Satisfied. Units consistent, notation conventional.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not Multipart/Single Target):** Satisfied. Single target quantity.
*   **Guideline 11 (Formatting):** Satisfied. LaTeX syntax correct.

**Actionable Feedback:**
Clarify how students should approach calculating the electric flux given the modified force law. Explicitly state whether they should assume the divergence of the electric field is still proportional to charge density (which would make the non-$1/r^2$ term irrelevant for flux outside the source, an unsatisfying outcome given the problem's setup), or if they are expected to calculate the integral $\int \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A}$ by deriving $\vec{E}$ from the modified force (which is significantly harder). For example: "Assuming the electric field $\vec{E}$ is related to the force on a test charge $q_0$ by $\vec{F} = q_0 \vec{E}$, determine the total electric flux..." This would guide them to calculate $\vec{E}$ first.

<question>A rapidly rotating neutron star with radius $R = 10^4 \, \mathrm{m}$ and mass $M = 2 \times 10^{30} \, \mathrm{kg}$ is emitting gravitational waves. Due to frame-dragging effects near the neutron star, the effective angular momentum $L$ of a test particle in a circular orbit of radius $r$ is modified. Assuming a weak-field approximation where the spacetime metric is described by the Kerr metric to first order in $a/r$ (where $a = J/Mc$ is the Kerr parameter and $J$ is the angular momentum of the neutron star), and considering the neutron star's angular frequency is $\omega$. Calculate the shift $\Delta \Omega$ in the orbital angular frequency $\Omega = \sqrt{GM/r^3}$ of the test particle at a distance $r = 3R$ from the neutron star’s center, due to the neutron star’s rotation. Express your answer in terms of $G$, $M$, $R$, $\omega$, and $c$. Assume that the neutron star is a uniform sphere.</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Model Physics Scenario):** Satisfied. A complex but clear GR scenario. Potentially too advanced for many undergraduate curricula, but suitable for specialized courses.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Format):** Satisfied. Symbolic expression expected.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Satisfied. Requires knowledge of GR, Kerr metric, frame dragging, and orbital mechanics.
*   **Guideline 5 (Uniqueness/Novelty):** Satisfied. A unique application.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Satisfied.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing/No Hints):** Not satisfied. The question contains two significant hints:
    *   "Assuming a weak-field approximation where the spacetime metric is described by the Kerr metric to first order in $a/r$" – This explicitly tells the student the approximation to use, which should ideally be part of their problem-solving strategy or knowledge.
    *   "orbital angular frequency $\Omega = \sqrt{GM/r^3}$" – This provides the unperturbed (Newtonian) orbital frequency, which should be a known value or derived as part of the problem.
*   **Guideline 8 (Assumptions/Variable Definition):** Satisfied. All variables defined and assumptions stated.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units/Notation):** Satisfied. Units consistent, notation conventional.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not Multipart/Single Target):** Partially satisfied. Single target, but the hints violate the "no hints" rule.
*   **Guideline 11 (Formatting):** Satisfied. LaTeX syntax correct.

**Actionable Feedback:**
Remove the explicit hints:
1.  Instead of "Assuming a weak-field approximation where the spacetime metric is described by the Kerr metric to first order in $a/r$", simply state "Assuming a weak-field approximation for the Kerr metric."
2.  Remove "$\Omega = \sqrt{GM/r^3}$". The student should be expected to know or derive the unperturbed Keplerian frequency.

<question>Consider a scalar field $\phi(x)$ with a potential $V(\phi) = \frac{1}{2}m^2 \phi^2 + \frac{\lambda}{4!} \phi^4$ in a de Sitter space with a Hubble parameter $H$. The scalar field undergoes quantum fluctuations during inflation. Assuming the field is initially at $\phi = 0$, and using the stochastic inflation formalism, estimate the variance $\langle \phi^2 \rangle$ of the scalar field after a long period of inflation, when it reaches a statistical equilibrium. Express your answer in terms of $H$ and $m$ (the mass of the scalar field), assuming $m^2 \ll H^2$.</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Model Physics Scenario):** Satisfied. A theoretical cosmology/QFT scenario. This is an extremely advanced topic, typically found in graduate-level courses in QFT in curved spacetime or cosmology. While it fits the "model a scenario" criteria, it's likely beyond the scope of a typical undergraduate physics curriculum. Assuming it's for a very specialized, advanced undergraduate course, it's well-posed.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Format):** Satisfied. Symbolic expression expected.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Satisfied. Requires significant theoretical understanding of quantum field theory in curved spacetime and stochastic inflation.
*   **Guideline 5 (Uniqueness/Novelty):** Satisfied. A unique application of the formalism.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Satisfied.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing/No Hints):** Satisfied. Phrasing is concise and specific, "using the stochastic inflation formalism" indicates the required framework, not a hint.
*   **Guideline 8 (Assumptions/Variable Definition):** Satisfied. All variables defined and assumptions stated.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units/Notation):** Satisfied. Units consistent, notation conventional.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not Multipart/Single Target):** Satisfied. Single target quantity.
*   **Guideline 11 (Formatting):** Satisfied. LaTeX syntax correct.

**Actionable Feedback:**
No specific improvements needed for the question itself, *assuming* the target audience is extremely advanced undergraduates (e.g., a capstone course in theoretical cosmology/QFT). If the target is a general undergraduate physics student, this question is likely too difficult and should be replaced with a more accessible topic.

<question>In a strong magnetic field regime, the energy levels of an electron are quantized into Landau levels. Consider an electron confined to a two-dimensional plane in a uniform magnetic field $B$ perpendicular to the plane. The electron has a charge $-e$ and mass $m$. Calculate the density of states $D(E)$ (number of states per unit energy per unit area) for the Landau levels, considering only the lowest Landau level (LLL). Express your answer in terms of $e$, $B$, $h$ (Planck's constant), and fundamental constants.</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Model Physics Scenario):** Satisfied. A clear quantum mechanics/condensed matter scenario.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Format):** Satisfied. Symbolic expression expected.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Satisfied. Involves calculating the degeneracy of a Landau level and then understanding how this contributes to the density of states.
*   **Guideline 5 (Uniqueness/Novelty):** Not satisfied. Calculating the density of states for Landau levels (especially the degeneracy of a single level) is a *very standard textbook derivation* in quantum mechanics and condensed matter physics. This violates the "Be Unique" criterion.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Satisfied.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing/No Hints):** Satisfied. Phrasing is concise and no hints are given.
*   **Guideline 8 (Assumptions/Variable Definition):** Satisfied. All variables defined and assumptions stated.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units/Notation):** Satisfied. Units consistent, notation conventional.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not Multipart/Single Target):** Satisfied. Single target quantity.
*   **Guideline 11 (Formatting):** Satisfied. LaTeX syntax correct.

**Actionable Feedback:**
To meet the "Be Unique" criterion, modify the scenario. For example, consider:
*   A time-dependent magnetic field (adiabatic approximation).
*   A spatially non-uniform magnetic field (e.g., $B(x)$).
*   The effects of a weak electric field in addition to the magnetic field.
*   Calculating the density of states for *all* Landau levels, including spin, up to a certain energy.
*   Consider a 1D electron gas in a magnetic field or a different geometry.

<question>A modified gravity theory proposes that the effective gravitational constant $G_{eff}$ depends on the local energy density $\rho$ as $G_{eff} = G_0 \left(1 + \beta \frac{\rho}{\rho_c}\right)$, where $G_0$ is the Newtonian gravitational constant, $\beta$ is a dimensionless constant, and $\rho_c$ is a critical density. Consider a galaxy cluster with a mass $M$ and radius $R$ with a uniform mass density. Using the virial theorem, $2K + U = 0$, where $K$ is the kinetic energy and $U$ is the potential energy, estimate the typical velocity $v$ of a galaxy within the cluster, taking into account the modified gravitational constant. Express your answer in terms of $G_0$, $M$, $R$, $\beta$, and $\rho_c$.</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Model Physics Scenario):** Satisfied. A clear, hypothetical scenario.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Format):** Satisfied. Symbolic expression expected.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Satisfied. Requires calculating potential energy with modified G, relating it to kinetic energy, and using the virial theorem.
*   **Guideline 5 (Uniqueness/Novelty):** Satisfied. A novel application of the virial theorem.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Satisfied.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing/No Hints):** Not satisfied. The question explicitly provides the form of the virial theorem ("$2K + U = 0$"). This is a hint.
*   **Guideline 8 (Assumptions/Variable Definition):** Satisfied. All variables defined and assumptions stated.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units/Notation):** Satisfied. Units consistent, notation conventional.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not Multipart/Single Target):** Partially satisfied. Single target, but the hint violates the "no hints" rule.
*   **Guideline 11 (Formatting):** Satisfied. LaTeX syntax correct.

**Actionable Feedback:**
Remove the explicit statement of the virial theorem's form. Instead of "Using the virial theorem, $2K + U = 0$", simply state "Using the virial theorem, estimate the typical velocity $v$..." Students should be expected to know or recall the appropriate form of the virial theorem.
