<question>Consider a quantum system described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian $H = H_0 + \lambda V$, where $H_0$ is the unperturbed Hermitian Hamiltonian with known eigenvalues $E_n^{(0)}$ and eigenvectors $|\psi_n^{(0)}\rangle$, and $V$ is a non-Hermitian perturbation. Suppose we want to calculate the energy eigenvalues to second order in $\lambda$. Due to the non-Hermitian nature of $V$, the right and left eigenvectors of $H$ are not the same. Assuming the right eigenvectors are orthonormalized, derive an expression for the second-order energy correction $E_n^{(2)}$ in terms of the right and left eigenvectors of the unperturbed Hamiltonian $H_0$ and the perturbation $V$. Express your answer symbolically.</question>

<question>A particle of mass $m$ is confined within a one-dimensional infinite potential well of width $L$, described by $V(x) = 0$ for $0 < x < L$ and $V(x) = \infty$ otherwise.  A weak, position-dependent perturbation $V(x) = \lambda x^3$ is applied, where $\lambda$ is a small parameter. Calculate the first-order energy correction to the ground state energy using perturbation theory.  Express your answer symbolically in terms of $m$, $L$, $\lambda$, and fundamental constants.</question>

<question>A researcher is studying the dynamics of a complex fluid using Molecular Dynamics simulations. The interatomic potential energy function is given by a high-dimensional multivariate polynomial. The force on each atom needs to be calculated at every time step by taking the gradient of the potential energy with respect to the atomic positions. Given that the simulation involves $N = 10^6$ atoms and the potential energy function consists of $M = 10^3$ terms, each involving up to fifth order polynomials of atomic coordinates, estimate the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for force calculation in one time step using a naive algorithm. Express your answer in scientific notation.</question>

<question>Consider a system described by the Hamiltonian $H = H_0 + \lambda V$, where $H_0$ has a doubly degenerate energy level $E_0$. The perturbation $V$ is given by the matrix $V = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ b & c \end{pmatrix}$ in the degenerate subspace, where $a, b, c$ are real constants. If the perturbation is strong such that the energy levels cross (avoided crossing), and we expand the energy eigenvalues as a Puiseux series in powers of $\lambda$, determine the leading order term in the Puiseux series expansion of the *difference* between the two energy eigenvalues in the limit $\lambda \to 0$. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $a, b, c,$ and $\lambda$.</question>

<question>A researcher uses a finite difference method to solve the one-dimensional time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation for a particle in a potential $V(x)$. The domain is discretized into $N$ equally spaced points with spacing $h$. The resulting eigenvalue problem is represented by a sparse matrix equation $Ax = Ex$, where $A$ is a tri-diagonal matrix derived from the finite difference approximation of the second derivative. If $N = 10^5$, and the researcher uses the power iteration method to find the lowest eigenvalue, and if each iteration requires a matrix-vector multiplication, and if the algorithm converges after $K = 500$ iterations, estimate the total number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) required to determine the ground state energy. Express your answer in scientific notation.</question>
