Consider a one-dimensional non-Hermitian tight-binding lattice with $N$ sites, where the hopping amplitude from site $i$ to $i+1$ is $t_R = t + \gamma$ and from site $i$ to $i-1$ is $t_L = t - \gamma$, with $t$ being the usual hopping and $\gamma$ being a non-reciprocal parameter. Assume open boundary conditions. Due to the non-reciprocal hopping, all eigenstates are exponentially localized at one edge (skin effect).

Calculate the localization length $\xi$ of the skin mode, defined as the inverse of the absolute value of the imaginary part of the complex momentum $k$ (i.e., $\xi = 1/|\text{Im}(k)|$), for a state with energy $E = 2t$, in the limit of small non-reciprocity, $\gamma \ll t$.  Assume that the lattice constant $a=1$.

A one-dimensional non-Hermitian system is described by a Hamiltonian with a spatially varying gain/loss profile. The Hamiltonian is given by $H = p^2/2m - i\gamma(x)$, where $p$ is the momentum operator, $m$ is the mass, and $\gamma(x) = \gamma_0 \text{sech}^2(x/L)$, with $\gamma_0 > 0$ representing the maximum gain/loss strength and $L$ the characteristic length of the gain/loss region.  Assume that the system is initially in its ground state in the absence of gain/loss ($\gamma_0 = 0$).

Suddenly the gain/loss is switched on to a value of $\gamma_0$. The system is then allowed to evolve for a long time $T$. Due to the non-Hermiticity, the norm of the wave function changes in time. Find the late-time survival probability $| \langle \psi(0) | \psi(T) \rangle |^2$ where $|\psi(0)\rangle$ is the initial ground state and $|\psi(T)\rangle$ is the state after a long time $T$, in the limit $T \rightarrow \infty$, assuming that the lowest energy eigenstate of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is non-orthogonal to the initial ground state and the norm of this eigenstate is stable. Express your answer in terms of the complex energy $E_0$ of the lowest energy eigenstate of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, and the initial ground state energy $E_g$. Note that $| \langle \psi(0) | \psi(T) \rangle |^2 \propto e^{-2 \text{Im}(E_0) T}$.

Consider a non-Hermitian quantum system with a Hamiltonian $H = H_0 + iW$, where $H_0$ is a Hermitian Hamiltonian describing a free particle in a one-dimensional box of length $L$ with periodic boundary conditions, and $W$ is a non-Hermitian perturbation given by $W = \gamma \sum_n |n\rangle \langle n|$, where $\gamma$ is a real number, and $|n\rangle$ represents the position basis states.

Suppose we discretize the position space into $N$ equally spaced points. The initial state is a superposition of the first two eigenstates of $H_0$ with equal amplitudes. We want to study the dynamics of this system numerically using both the standard Crank-Nicolson method and a Chebyshev polynomial expansion method. The Crank-Nicolson method gives the time-evolved state $|\psi(t+\Delta t)\rangle$ by solving the equation: $(1 + i \Delta t H / 2) |\psi(t+\Delta t)\rangle = (1 - i \Delta t H / 2) |\psi(t)\rangle$.

After a time $t=t_f$, we observe that the norm of the wave function is significantly reduced due to the non-Hermitian term. It is known that the numerical error for the Crank-Nicolson method scales as $O(\Delta t^2)$, while the error for the Chebyshev polynomial method can be controlled to be exponentially small, provided sufficiently high polynomial order.

Given $H_0 = \frac{p^2}{2m} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$, $L = 1$, $N=100$, $\hbar=1$, $m=1$, $\gamma = 0.1$, and $t_f = 10$, determine a reasonable maximum value for the time step $\Delta t$ such that the relative error in the norm of the wave function obtained using the Crank-Nicolson method is less than 10%.

Consider a 2D non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model on a square lattice. The Hamiltonian in momentum space is given by:

$$H(\mathbf{k}) = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & t_1 + t_2 e^{-i k_x} + t_3 e^{-i k_y} & 0 & 0 \\
t_1 + t_2 e^{i k_x} + t_3 e^{i k_y} & 0 & \gamma_1 + \gamma_2 e^{-i k_x} + \gamma_3 e^{-i k_y} & 0 \\
0 & \gamma_1 + \gamma_2 e^{i k_x} + \gamma_3 e^{i k_y} & 0 & t_1 + t_2 e^{-i k_x} + t_3 e^{-i k_y} \\
0 & 0 & t_1 + t_2 e^{i k_x} + t_3 e^{i k_y} & 0
\end{pmatrix}$$

where $t_i$ are the Hermitian hopping terms, and $\gamma_i$ are the non-Hermitian hopping terms. Assume that $t_1 = 1, t_2 = 0.5, t_3 = 0.3, \gamma_1 = 0.2, \gamma_2 = 0.1, \gamma_3 = 0.05$.  Calculate the total Zak phase $\Theta$ in the $k_x$ direction ($\Theta = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} A_{k_x} dk_x$, where $A_{k_x} = i \langle u(k_x) | \frac{\partial}{\partial k_x} | u(k_x) \rangle$ is the Berry connection, and $|u(k_x)\rangle$ is the right eigenvector corresponding to the lowest energy band), at $k_y = 0$. Note: In this case, the Zak phase is quantized to be either 0 or $\pi$. You may numerically compute the Berry connection and integrate it.

A system of interacting bosons is described by the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian on a one-dimensional lattice of $L$ sites:

$$H = -t \sum_{i=1}^{L-1} (a_i^\dagger a_{i+1} + a_{i+1}^\dagger a_i) + \frac{U}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{L} n_i(n_i - 1) - \mu \sum_{i=1}^{L} n_i$$

where $a_i^\dagger$ and $a_i$ are the creation and annihilation operators for a boson on site $i$, $n_i = a_i^\dagger a_i$ is the number operator, $t$ is the hopping amplitude, $U$ is the on-site interaction strength, and $\mu$ is the chemical potential.

The system is initialized in a Mott insulator state with one boson per site ($n_i = 1$ for all $i$). A quantum quench is performed by suddenly changing the chemical potential from $\mu_0$ to $\mu_f$. After the quench, the system evolves unitarily according to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation.

Using the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) method with a matrix product state (MPS) representation, we want to investigate the real-time dynamics. For the TEBD algorithm, one typically decomposes the time evolution operator $e^{-i H \Delta t}$ into a product of two-site gates using a Suzuki-Trotter decomposition. Suppose the system has parameters $L = 10$, $t = 1$, $U = 5$, $\mu_0 = 4$, $\mu_f = 2$. Determine the bond dimension $\chi$ required in the MPS representation to ensure that the truncation error in the singular value decomposition (SVD) at each TEBD step is less than $10^{-6}$, after evolving for a time $t = 1$ with a time step $\Delta t = 0.01$. Provide your answer as a numerical value representing the minimum required bond dimension.

### Question 2 Critique

<question>
A one-dimensional non-Hermitian system is described by a Hamiltonian with a spatially varying gain/loss profile. The Hamiltonian is given by $H = p^2/2m - i\gamma(x)$, where $p$ is the momentum operator, $m$ is the mass, and $\gamma(x) = \gamma_0 \text{sech}^2(x/L)$, with $\gamma_0 > 0$ representing the maximum gain/loss strength and $L$ the characteristic length of the gain/loss region. Assume that the system is initially in its ground state in the absence of gain/loss ($\gamma_0 = 0$).

Suddenly the gain/loss is switched on to a value of $\gamma_0$. The system is then allowed to evolve for a long time $T$. Due to the non-Hermiticity, the norm of the wave function changes in time. Find the late-time survival probability $| \langle \psi(0) | \psi(T) \rangle |^2$ where $|\psi(0)\rangle$ is the initial ground state and $|\psi(T)\rangle$ is the state after a long time $T$, in the limit $T \rightarrow \infty$, assuming that the lowest energy eigenstate of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is non-orthogonal to the initial ground state and the norm of this eigenstate is stable. Express your answer in terms of the complex energy $E_0$ of the lowest energy eigenstate of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, and the initial ground state energy $E_g$. Note that $| \langle \psi(0) | \psi(T) \rangle |^2 \propto e^{-2 \text{Im}(E_0) T}$.

**Critique:**

*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** **PASS.** A relevant scenario involving a non-Hermitian quantum quench.
*   **2. Expect answers as either a symbolic expression or a single numerical value:** **PASS.** Asks for a symbolic expression.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** **PASS.** Requires understanding time evolution in non-Hermitian systems, expansion of initial states into non-Hermitian eigenstates, and identification of the dominant long-time component.
*   **4. Be Unique:** **PASS.** The specific form of the gain/loss profile and the quench scenario are unique.
*   **5. Single Solution:** **FAIL.** The question contains a logical contradiction and ambiguity.
    *   **Contradiction:** It states "the norm of the wave function changes in time" and provides a hint with $e^{-2 \text{Im}(E_0) T}$ (implying $\text{Im}(E_0) \neq 0$), but then states "the norm of this eigenstate is stable." If the norm of an eigenstate is stable, it means $\text{Im}(E_0) = 0$, which contradicts the rest of the problem. This makes the premise inconsistent.
    *   **Ambiguity:** "Lowest energy eigenstate" for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with complex energies is ambiguous (e.g., smallest real part? smallest magnitude? smallest imaginary part?). This needs explicit clarification for a unique solution.
    *   The requirement to express the answer in terms of $E_g$ is problematic, as $E_g$ (the initial ground state energy) does not naturally appear in the exponent. It would only appear in the prefactor related to overlaps, which the proportionality hint seems to downplay.
*   **6. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** **FAIL.** The phrasing "the norm of this eigenstate is stable" is imprecise and directly contradicts the problem's context.
*   **7. All assumptions must be clearly stated, and all variables must be defined:** **PARTIAL PASS.** Most variables are defined. However, the problematic assumption about the "stable norm" and the ambiguity of "lowest energy eigenstate" render crucial parts of the problem ill-defined.
*   **8. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional physics notation:** **PASS.** No numerical answer. Units and notation are consistent.
*   **9. Questions must not be multipart:** **PASS.** Asks for a single quantity.
*   **10. Question Formatting:** **PASS.** Correct LaTeX/Markdown formatting.

**Actionable Feedback for Question 2:**
1.  **Resolve Contradiction:** Remove the phrase "and the norm of this eigenstate is stable." If the intent was that the *eigenstate itself* is normalized, clarify that, but this phrasing is misleading regarding its time evolution.
2.  **Clarify "Lowest Energy Eigenstate":** Specify how to order complex energies (e.g., "the eigenstate with the smallest real part of energy whose imaginary part is positive and minimal").
3.  **Clarify Answer Format:** If the prefactor involving overlaps is *not* expected, state that clearly (e.g., "Find the time-dependent factor of the survival probability"). If it *is* expected, then ensure the information needed to calculate it is available (e.g., specifying reliance on right vs. left eigenstates for expansion). The inclusion of $E_g$ suggests it should appear in the answer, but it's not immediately clear how it would beyond defining the initial state.

### Question 3 Critique

```xml
<question>
Consider a non-Hermitian quantum system with a Hamiltonian $H = H_0 + iW$, where $H_0$ is a Hermitian Hamiltonian describing a free particle in a one-dimensional box of length $L$ with periodic boundary conditions, and $W$ is a non-Hermitian perturbation given by $W = \gamma \sum_n |n\rangle \langle n|$, where $\gamma$ is a real number, and $|n\rangle$ represents the position basis states.

Suppose we discretize the position space into $N$ equally spaced points. The initial state is a superposition of the first two eigenstates of $H_0$ with equal amplitudes. We want to study the dynamics of this system numerically using both the standard Crank-Nicolson method and a Chebyshev polynomial expansion method. The Crank-Nicolson method gives the time-evolved state $|\psi(t+\Delta t)\rangle$ by solving the equation: $(1 + i \Delta t H / 2) |\psi(t+\Delta t)\rangle = (1 - i \Delta t H / 2) |\psi(t)\rangle$.

After a time $t=t_f$, we observe that the norm of the wave function is significantly reduced due to the non-Hermitian term. It is known that the numerical error for the Crank-Nicolson method scales as $O(\Delta t^2)$, while the error for the Chebyshev polynomial method can be controlled to be exponentially small, provided sufficiently high polynomial order.

Given $H_0 = \frac{p^2}{2m} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$, $L = 1$, $N=100$, $\hbar=1$, $m=1$, $\gamma = 0.1$, and $t_f = 10$, determine a reasonable maximum value for the time step $\Delta t$ such that the relative error in the norm of the wave function obtained using the Crank-Nicolson method is less than 10%.
</question>
```

**Critique:**

*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** **PASS.** A relevant computational physics scenario involving numerical time evolution of a non-Hermitian system.
*   **2. Expect answers as either a symbolic expression or a single numerical value:** **PASS.** Expects a single numerical value for $\Delta t$.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** **PASS.** Requires: (1) Understanding the Hamiltonian and its non-Hermitian part, (2) Knowing the exact time evolution of the norm for this specific non-Hermitian term (which is $|\psi(t)|^2 = |\psi(0)|^2 e^{-2\gamma t}$), (3) Understanding Crank-Nicolson numerical error accumulation.
*   **4. Be Unique:** **PASS.** Combines non-Hermitian QM with specific numerical methods and error analysis, making it unique.
*   **5. Single Solution:** **FAIL.** The question asks for a specific numerical value for $\Delta t$ but provides only the scaling behavior of the error ($O(\Delta t^2)$), not the proportionality constant. Without this constant (which depends on the specific Hamiltonian and state), it's impossible to determine a unique numerical maximum value for $\Delta t$. A student can only estimate this order of magnitude based on general stability criteria, which is not precise enough for a "single numerical result".
*   **6. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** **PARTIAL PASS.** While the phrasing is clear, the missing error coefficient makes the question unsolvable for a specific numerical answer.
*   **7. All assumptions must be clearly stated, and all variables must be defined:** **FAIL.** All variables are defined, and the scaling is given, but the crucial proportionality constant for the error in the norm is missing.
*   **8. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional physics notation:** **PASS.** Natural units are used, and consistency is maintained. $\Delta t$ will be in units of time.
*   **9. Questions must not be multipart:** **PASS.** Asks for a single quantity: $\Delta t$.
*   **10. Question Formatting:** **PASS.** Correct LaTeX/Markdown formatting.

**Actionable Feedback for Question 3:**
1.  **Provide Error Coefficient:** To make it solvable for a specific numerical answer, provide an explicit formula for the relative error in the norm, including a proportionality constant. For example: "The relative error in the norm of the wave function obtained using the Crank-Nicolson method is approximately $C \cdot t_f \cdot (\Delta t)^2$, where $C$ is a numerical constant (e.g., $C = 0.5 \cdot E_{max}^2$, assuming maximum energy $E_{max}$ can be estimated from system parameters)."
2.  **Reframe as Conceptual/Estimative:** If a precise numerical answer isn't the goal, reframe the question to ask for a symbolic expression for $\Delta t$ in terms of an unknown error constant, or ask for a discussion of how one would determine a reasonable $\Delta t$.

### Question 4 Critique

Consider a 2D non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model on a square lattice. The Hamiltonian in momentum space is given by:

$$H(\mathbf{k}) = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & t_1 + t_2 e^{-i k_x} + t_3 e^{-i k_y} & 0 & 0 \\
t_1 + t_2 e^{i k_x} + t_3 e^{i k_y} & 0 & \gamma_1 + \gamma_2 e^{-i k_x} + \gamma_3 e^{-i k_y} & 0 \\
0 & \gamma_1 + \gamma_2 e^{i k_x} + \gamma_3 e^{i k_y} & 0 & t_1 + t_2 e^{-i k_x} + t_3 e^{-i k_y} \\
0 & 0 & t_1 + t_2 e^{i k_x} + t_3 e^{i k_y} & 0
\end{pmatrix}$$

where $t_i$ are the Hermitian hopping terms, and $\gamma_i$ are the non-Hermitian hopping terms. Assume that $t_1 = 1, t_2 = 0.5, t_3 = 0.3, \gamma_1 = 0.2, \gamma_2 = 0.1, \gamma_3 = 0.05$. Calculate the total Zak phase $\Theta$ in the $k_x$ direction ($\Theta = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} A_{k_x} dk_x$, where $A_{k_x} = i \langle u(k_x) | \frac{\partial}{\partial k_x} | u(k_x) \rangle$ is the Berry connection, and $|u(k_x)\rangle$ is the right eigenvector corresponding to the lowest energy band), at $k_y = 0$. Note: In this case, the Zak phase is quantized to be either 0 or $\pi$. You may numerically compute the Berry connection and integrate it.
</question>
```

**Critique:**

*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** **PASS.** A highly specialized and current research-level scenario in non-Hermitian topological phases.
*   **2. Expect answers as either a symbolic expression or a single numerical value:** **PASS.** Expects a numerical value (0 or $\pi$).
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** **PASS.** Requires multiple complex steps: (1) Setting $k_y=0$, (2) Numerically diagonalizing the $4 \times 4$ complex Hamiltonian matrix for many $k_x$ values, (3) Identifying the "lowest energy band" (problematic, see below), (4) Numerically computing the derivative of the eigenvector with respect to $k_x$, (5) Calculating the Berry connection, (6) Numerically integrating it.
*   **4. Be Unique:** **PASS.** A very specific 2D non-Hermitian SSH model makes this highly unique.
*   **5. Single Solution:** **FAIL.** The ambiguity of "lowest energy band" in a non-Hermitian system with potentially complex eigenvalues prevents a unique solution. For non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, eigenvalues are generally complex, and ordering them by "energy" (real part, imaginary part, magnitude?) is not standard or necessarily unique.
*   **6. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** **PARTIAL PASS.** While mostly rigorous, the critical phrase "lowest energy band" is ambiguous in this context.
*   **7. All assumptions must be clearly stated, and all variables must be defined:** **PARTIAL PASS.** All variables are defined. However, the interpretation of "lowest energy band" for a non-Hermitian system's complex spectrum is a crucial implicit assumption that needs explicit clarification. The note that the Zak phase is quantized to 0 or $\pi$ also implies that the eigenvalues of the relevant band are real, or that the Berry connection is real, which should ideally be stated or explained.
*   **8. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional physics notation:** **PASS.** Dimensionless quantities, consistent notation.
*   **9. Questions must not be multipart:** **PASS.** Asks for a single quantity: Zak phase $\Theta$.
*   **10. Question Formatting:** **PASS.** Correct LaTeX/Markdown formatting.

**Actionable Feedback for Question 4:**
1.  **Clarify "Lowest Energy Band":** Explicitly state how to order the complex eigenvalues to define the "lowest energy band." For example, "the eigenstate with the smallest real part of its complex energy," or "the eigenstate whose real part is minimal and whose imaginary part is zero."
2.  **Confirm Realness of Berry Connection/Zak Phase:** Given the quantization to 0 or $\pi$, it implies a real Berry connection. This should be stated or guaranteed by the problem setup (e.g., specifying PT symmetry in the relevant band).

### Question 5 Critique

```xml
<question>
A system of interacting bosons is described by the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian on a one-dimensional lattice of $L$ sites:

$$H = -t \sum_{i=1}^{L-1} (a_i^\dagger a_{i+1} + a_{i+1}^\dagger a_i) + \frac{U}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{L} n_i(n_i - 1) - \mu \sum_{i=1}^{L} n_i$$

where $a_i^\dagger$ and $a_i$ are the creation and annihilation operators for a boson on site $i$, $n_i = a_i^\dagger a_i$ is the number operator, $t$ is the hopping amplitude, $U$ is the on-site interaction strength, and $\mu$ is the chemical potential.

The system is initialized in a Mott insulator state with one boson per site ($n_i = 1$ for all $i$). A quantum quench is performed by suddenly changing the chemical potential from $\mu_0$ to $\mu_f$. After the quench, the system evolves unitarily according to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation.

Using the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) method with a matrix product state (MPS) representation, we want to investigate the real-time dynamics. For the TEBD algorithm, one typically decomposes the time evolution operator $e^{-i H \Delta t}$ into a product of two-site gates using a Suzuki-Trotter decomposition. Suppose the system has parameters $L = 10$, $t = 1$, $U = 5$, $\mu_0 = 4$, $\mu_f = 2$. Determine the bond dimension $\chi$ required in the MPS representation to ensure that the truncation error in the singular value decomposition (SVD) at each TEBD step is less than $10^{-6}$, after evolving for a time $t = 1$ with a time step $\Delta t = 0.01$. Provide your answer as a numerical value representing the minimum required bond dimension.
</question>
```

**Critique:**

*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** **PASS.** A highly complex and specific scenario in computational many-body physics, combining the Bose-Hubbard model, quantum quenches, and advanced numerical methods (TEBD/MPS).
*   **2. Expect answers as either a symbolic expression or a single numerical value:** **PASS.** Expects a single numerical value for $\chi$.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** **PASS (conceptually).** It implies understanding of all the concepts mentioned (Bose-Hubbard, quench, TEBD, MPS, SVD truncation error).
*   **4. Be Unique:** **PASS.** Very specific and unique, reflecting current research topics.
*   **5. Single Solution:** **FAIL.** The required bond dimension $\chi$ for a given SVD truncation error in a real-time quantum quench cannot be determined analytically or even easily estimated without running a full numerical simulation. The entanglement entropy of the evolved state, which dictates the necessary $\chi$, is highly state-dependent and grows dynamically during a quench. Asking for a specific numerical value for $\chi$ from the given parameters is equivalent to asking the student to perform a full, non-trivial numerical simulation.
*   **6. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** **PASS.** The phrasing is technically accurate and concise within the field.
*   **7. All assumptions must be clearly stated, and all variables must be defined:** **FAIL.** All given variables are defined. However, the implicit assumption that $\chi$ can be determined from these input parameters is fundamentally flawed.
*   **8. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional physics notation:** **PASS.** Bond dimension $\chi$ is dimensionless. Notation is standard.
*   **9. Questions must not be multipart:** **PASS.** Asks for a single quantity: $\chi$.
*   **10. Question Formatting:** **PASS.** Correct LaTeX/Markdown formatting.

**Actionable Feedback for Question 5:**
1.  **Reframe the Question:** Instead of asking for a specific numerical value, ask for a conceptual discussion about the factors influencing the bond dimension $\chi$ during a quench, or how one would *determine* the required $\chi$ in practice (e.g., by monitoring entanglement or error during a pilot simulation).
2.  **Provide Necessary Data (If Numerical Answer is Essential):** If a numerical answer for $\chi$ is truly desired, the question would need to provide pre-computed data (e.g., a graph of entanglement entropy or bond dimension vs. time for the specific quench) from which the student could extract the value. This, however, goes beyond typical assessment question design.

A one-dimensional non-Hermitian system is described by a Hamiltonian with a spatially varying gain/loss profile. The Hamiltonian is given by $H = p^2/2m - i\gamma(x)$, where $p$ is the momentum operator, $m$ is the mass, and $\gamma(x) = \gamma_0 \text{sech}^2(x/L)$, with $\gamma_0 > 0$ representing the maximum gain/loss strength and $L$ the characteristic length of the gain/loss region. Assume that the system is initially in its ground state in the absence of gain/loss ($\gamma_0 = 0$).

Suddenly the gain/loss is switched on to a value of $\gamma_0$. The system is then allowed to evolve for a long time $T$. Due to the non-Hermiticity, the norm of the wave function changes in time. Find the time-dependent factor of the late-time survival probability $| \langle \psi(0) | \psi(T) \rangle |^2$ where $|\psi(0)\rangle$ is the initial ground state and $|\psi(T)\rangle$ is the state after a long time $T$, in the limit $T \rightarrow \infty$. Assume that the lowest energy eigenstate is defined as the eigenstate with the smallest real part of energy whose imaginary part is positive and minimal, and this eigenstate is non-orthogonal to the initial ground state.

Consider a non-Hermitian quantum system with a Hamiltonian $H = H_0 + iW$, where $H_0$ is a Hermitian Hamiltonian describing a free particle in a one-dimensional box of length $L$ with periodic boundary conditions, and $W$ is a non-Hermitian perturbation given by $W = \gamma \sum_n |n\rangle \langle n|$, where $\gamma$ is a real number, and $|n\rangle$ represents the position basis states.

Suppose we discretize the position space into $N$ equally spaced points. The initial state is a superposition of the first two eigenstates of $H_0$ with equal amplitudes. We want to study the dynamics of this system numerically using the standard Crank-Nicolson method. The Crank-Nicolson method gives the time-evolved state $|\psi(t+\Delta t)\rangle$ by solving the equation: $(1 + i \Delta t H / 2) |\psi(t+\Delta t)\rangle = (1 - i \Delta t H / 2) |\psi(t)\rangle$.

After a time $t=t_f$, we observe that the norm of the wave function is significantly reduced due to the non-Hermitian term. It is known that the relative error in the norm of the wave function obtained using the Crank-Nicolson method is approximately $C \cdot t_f \cdot (\Delta t)^2$, where $C = 0.5 \cdot E_{max}^2$, and $E_{max}$ represents a rough upper bound for the energy eigenvalues of $H$. Given $H_0 = \frac{p^2}{2m} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$, $L = 1$, $N=100$, $\hbar=1$, $m=1$, $\gamma = 0.1$, and $t_f = 10$, determine a reasonable maximum value for the time step $\Delta t$ such that the relative error in the norm of the wave function obtained using the Crank-Nicolson method is less than 10%.

Consider a 2D non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model on a square lattice. The Hamiltonian in momentum space is given by:

$$H(\mathbf{k}) = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & t_1 + t_2 e^{-i k_x} + t_3 e^{-i k_y} & 0 & 0 \\
t_1 + t_2 e^{i k_x} + t_3 e^{i k_y} & 0 & \gamma_1 + \gamma_2 e^{-i k_x} + \gamma_3 e^{-i k_y} & 0 \\
0 & \gamma_1 + \gamma_2 e^{i k_x} + \gamma_3 e^{i k_y} & 0 & t_1 + t_2 e^{-i k_x} + t_3 e^{i k_y} \\
0 & 0 & t_1 + t_2 e^{i k_x} + t_3 e^{i k_y} & 0
\end{pmatrix}$$

where $t_i$ are the Hermitian hopping terms, and $\gamma_i$ are the non-Hermitian hopping terms. Assume that $t_1 = 1, t_2 = 0.5, t_3 = 0.3, \gamma_1 = 0.2, \gamma_2 = 0.1, \gamma_3 = 0.05$. Calculate the total Zak phase $\Theta$ in the $k_x$ direction ($\Theta = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} A_{k_x} dk_x$, where $A_{k_x} = i \langle u(k_x) | \frac{\partial}{\partial k_x} | u(k_x) \rangle$ is the Berry connection, and $|u(k_x)\rangle$ is the right eigenvector corresponding to the eigenstate with the smallest real part of its complex energy), at $k_y = 0$. Assume the Berry connection is real. Note: In this case, the Zak phase is quantized to be either 0 or $\pi$. You may numerically compute the Berry connection and integrate it.

A system of interacting bosons is described by the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian on a one-dimensional lattice of $L$ sites:

$$H = -t \sum_{i=1}^{L-1} (a_i^\dagger a_{i+1} + a_{i+1}^\dagger a_i) + \frac{U}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{L} n_i(n_i - 1) - \mu \sum_{i=1}^{L} n_i$$

where $a_i^\dagger$ and $a_i$ are the creation and annihilation operators for a boson on site $i$, $n_i = a_i^\dagger a_i$ is the number operator, $t$ is the hopping amplitude, $U$ is the on-site interaction strength, and $\mu$ is the chemical potential.

The system is initialized in a Mott insulator state with one boson per site ($n_i = 1$ for all $i$). A quantum quench is performed by suddenly changing the chemical potential from $\mu_0$ to $\mu_f$. After the quench, the system evolves unitarily according to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation.

Using the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) method with a matrix product state (MPS) representation, we want to investigate the real-time dynamics. For the TEBD algorithm, one typically decomposes the time evolution operator $e^{-i H \Delta t}$ into a product of two-site gates using a Suzuki-Trotter decomposition. Suppose the system has parameters $L = 10$, $t = 1$, $U = 5$, $\mu_0 = 4$, $\mu_f = 2$. Discuss the key factors that influence the required bond dimension $\chi$ in the MPS representation to achieve a target accuracy when simulating the dynamics after the quench. How would you determine a suitable value for $\chi$ in practice?

Consider a one-dimensional non-Hermitian tight-binding lattice with $N$ sites, where the hopping amplitude from site $i$ to $i+1$ is $t_R = t + \gamma$ and from site $i$ to $i-1$ is $t_L = t - \gamma$, with $t$ being the usual hopping and $\gamma$ being a non-reciprocal parameter. Assume open boundary conditions. Due to the non-reciprocal hopping, all eigenstates are exponentially localized at one edge (skin effect).

Calculate the localization length $\xi$ of the skin mode, defined as the inverse of the absolute value of the imaginary part of the complex momentum $k$ (i.e., $\xi = 1/|\text{Im}(k)|$), for a state with energy $E = 2t$, in the limit of small non-reciprocity, $\gamma \ll t$.  Assume that the lattice constant $a=1$. Express your answer in terms of $t$ and $\gamma$.

**Question 2 Critique:**

<question>
A one-dimensional non-Hermitian system is described by a Hamiltonian with a spatially varying gain/loss profile. The Hamiltonian is given by $H = p^2/2m - i\gamma(x)$, where $p$ is the momentum operator, $m$ is the mass, and $\gamma(x) = \gamma_0 \text{sech}^2(x/L)$, with $\gamma_0 > 0$ representing the maximum gain/loss strength and $L$ the characteristic length of the gain/loss region. Assume that the system is initially in its ground state in the absence of gain/loss ($\gamma_0 = 0$).

Suddenly the gain/loss is switched on to a value of $\gamma_0$. The system is then allowed to evolve for a long time $T$. Due to the non-Hermiticity, the norm of the wave function changes in time. Find the time-dependent factor of the late-time survival probability $| \langle \psi(0) | \psi(T) \rangle |^2$ where $|\psi(0)\rangle$ is the initial ground state and $|\psi(T)\rangle$ is the state after a long time $T$, in the limit $T \rightarrow \infty$. Assume that the lowest energy eigenstate is defined as the eigenstate with the smallest real part of energy whose imaginary part is positive and minimal, and this eigenstate is non-orthogonal to the initial ground state. Express your answer as the exponential time dependence $e^{\alpha T}$, where $\alpha$ is an expression in terms of the complex energy $E_0$ of the lowest energy eigenstate.

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Excellent. A conceptually rich and advanced scenario involving non-Hermitian quantum mechanics.
*   **Guideline 2 (Expect symbolic/numerical answer):** Excellent. Expects a symbolic expression.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Excellent. Requires understanding non-Hermitian time evolution, eigenstate dominance, and properties of survival probability.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Excellent. This is a novel and highly specific problem.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** **Needs improvement.** The definition of the "lowest energy eigenstate" is problematic: "smallest real part of energy whose imaginary part is positive and minimal." In the limit $T \rightarrow \infty$, the survival probability (or any state evolving under a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian) will be dominated by the eigenstate with the *algebraically largest* imaginary part of its energy (fastest growing norm). If $\gamma_0 > 0$ implies gain, then "positive and minimal" means the *slowest growing* of the growing modes, which will *not* dominate in the long time limit. This ambiguity prevents a single, unambiguous solution.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Good, but the definition of the "lowest energy eigenstate" is confusing and potentially contradictory as noted above.
*   **Guideline 8 (Assumptions/Variables):** Good, but the key definition of $E_0$ (the dominant eigenstate) is unclear.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units/Notation):** Excellent.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):** Excellent.
*   **Guideline 11 (Question Formatting):** Excellent.

**Critique Summary & Actionable Feedback:**
This question is conceptually strong and unique but suffers from an ambiguous definition that is critical to finding the single correct answer.
*   **Action:** **Clarify the definition of the dominant eigenstate ($E_0$) for the long-time limit.** It should be the eigenstate with the *algebraically largest* (or maximal positive if gain) imaginary part of its energy, as this is the mode that dominates in the long-time limit. For example: "Assume that the lowest energy eigenstate is defined as the eigenstate with the smallest real part of energy whose imaginary part is algebraically maximal (i.e., the largest positive value, or the least negative value if all are negative), and this eigenstate is non-orthogonal to the initial ground state." This ensures that the state chosen is indeed the one that dominates the long-time evolution.

A strong, unique, and multi-step question. The only area for improvement is to remove any potential ambiguity in the definition of $E_{max}$.

where $t_i$ are the Hermitian hopping terms, and $\gamma_i$ are the non-Hermitian hopping terms. Assume that $t_1 = 1, t_2 = 0.5, t_3 = 0.3, \gamma_1 = 0.2, \gamma_2 = 0.1, \gamma_3 = 0.05$. Calculate the total Zak phase $\Theta$ in the $k_x$ direction ($\Theta = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} A_{k_x} dk_x$, where $A_{k_x} = i \langle u(k_x) | \frac{\partial}{\partial k_x} | u(k_x) \rangle$ is the Berry connection, and $|u(k_x)\rangle$ is the right eigenvector corresponding to the eigenstate with the smallest real part of its complex energy), at $k_y = 0$.

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Excellent. This models a highly advanced and current topic in non-Hermitian topological phases.
*   **Guideline 2 (Expect symbolic/numerical answer):** Excellent. Expects a single numerical value.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Excellent, but **excessively demanding for a single question.** This problem requires multiple stages of complex numerical computation:
    1.  Diagonalizing a complex $4 \times 4$ matrix at *many* $k_x$ points.
    2.  Carefully selecting the correct eigenvector (band tracking) based on complex energy values.
    3.  Numerically calculating the derivative of an eigenvector (which is highly non-trivial and prone to numerical instability if not handled carefully, e.g., using finite differences on eigenvectors requires proper gauge fixing).
    4.  Numerically integrating the Berry connection.
    This is typically a multi-day project, not a single assessment question.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Excellent. This is a cutting-edge and highly unique problem.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** **Needs improvement.** The definition of $|u(k_x)\rangle$ as "the right eigenvector corresponding to the eigenstate with the smallest real part of its complex energy" can be ambiguous. If two energy levels cross or have the same smallest real part but different imaginary parts, the choice is unclear, which is critical for band tracking in topological calculations. This could lead to different interpretations and results.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Good, but the phrasing implies a numerical burden too great for a single question. The ambiguity in eigenstate selection is also present.

*   **Guideline 9 (Units/Notation):** Excellent.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):** Excellent.
*   **Guideline 11 (Question Formatting):** Excellent.

**Critique Summary & Actionable Feedback:**
This question is brilliant in its uniqueness and relevance, but its practical implementation as a single assessment question is highly problematic due to extreme computational demands and a critical ambiguity.
*   **Action 1 (Most important): Drastically reduce the computational burden.** This question is better suited as a multi-part project or a conceptually-focused question. Instead of asking for a full numerical calculation, perhaps:
    *   Ask for a specific analytical limit where the calculation simplifies.
    *   Ask for the conditions under which a phase transition (and thus a change in Zak phase) occurs, without requiring the full integral.
    *   Provide pre-calculated values for $A_{k_x}$ at various $k_x$ and ask for the integration.
*   **Action 2: Clarify eigenstate selection.** If the numerical calculation is retained (e.g., for a project), explicitly state how to handle cases where multiple eigenstates have the smallest real part, and emphasize the importance of band tracking/continuity. For example: "Choose the eigenstate with the smallest real part of energy, and among those, the one with the smallest magnitude of its imaginary part, ensuring that the chosen band is continuous across the Brillouin zone."

A system of interacting bosons is described by the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian on a one-dimensional lattice of $L$ sites:

$$H = -t \sum_{i=1}^{L-1} (a_i^\dagger a_{i+1} + a_{i+1}^\dagger a_i) + \frac{U}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{L} n_i(n_i - 1) - \mu \sum_{i=1}^{L} n_i$$

where $a_i^\dagger$ and $a_i$ are the creation and annihilation operators for a boson on site $i$, $n_i = a_i^\dagger a_i$ is the number operator, $t$ is the hopping amplitude, $U$ is the on-site interaction strength, and $\mu$ is the chemical potential.

The system is initialized in a Mott insulator state with one boson per site ($n_i = 1$ for all $i$). A quantum quench is performed by suddenly changing the chemical potential from $\mu_0$ to $\mu_f$. After the quench, the system evolves unitarily according to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation.

Using the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) method with a matrix product state (MPS) representation, we want to investigate the real-time dynamics. For the TEBD algorithm, one typically decomposes the time evolution operator $e^{-i H \Delta t}$ into a product of two-site gates using a Suzuki-Trotter decomposition. Suppose the system has parameters $L = 10$, $t = 1$, $U = 5$, $\mu_0 = 4$, $\mu_f = 2$. Discuss the key factors that influence the required bond dimension $\chi$ in the MPS representation to achieve a target accuracy when simulating the dynamics after the quench.

**Critique Summary & Actionable Feedback:**
This is an excellent conceptual question for an advanced course, but it violates the fundamental requirement for a single symbolic/numerical answer.
*   **Action:** **Rephrase the question to ask for a calculable quantity or a precise numerical estimate.** For instance:
    *   "Estimate the maximum bond dimension $\chi_{max}$ expected during the simulation up to time $t_f = 10$ to achieve a truncation error below X (e.g., $10^{-4}$), given that the entanglement entropy grows linearly with time after the quench with a rate of $s$ (e.g., $s=0.5$)." (This might still be too complex for a direct calculation without prior knowledge/data).
    *   "Given a target accuracy, and typical growth rates of entanglement after a quench in the Bose-Hubbard model, provide a reasonable numerical estimate for the maximum bond dimension $\chi$ required for a simulation up to $t=10$ with parameters $L=10, t=1, U=5, \mu_0=4, \mu_f=2$." (This requires the student to recall or look up typical entanglement growth behavior).
    *   Alternatively, provide a table of simulation results with different $\chi$ values and ask the student to *select* the most suitable $\chi$ based on accuracy criteria, justifying their choice quantitatively. However, this moves it towards a multiple-choice or data-analysis style question, which might not be the intent.

The key is to transform the "discuss" prompt into a "calculate/determine" prompt.

Suppose we discretize the position space into $N$ equally spaced points. The initial state is a superposition of the first two eigenstates of $H_0$ with equal amplitudes.

where $t_i$ are the Hermitian hopping terms, and $\gamma_i$ are the non-Hermitian hopping terms. Assume that $t_1 = 1, t_2 = 0.5, t_3 = 0.3, \gamma_1 = 0.2, \gamma_2 = 0.1, \gamma_3 = 0.05$. Instead of calculating the full Zak phase, determine whether the Zak phase in the $k_x$ direction ($\Theta = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} A_{k_x} dk_x$, where $A_{k_x} = i \langle u(k_x) | \frac{\partial}{\partial k_x} | u(k_x) \rangle$ is the Berry connection, and $|u(k_x)\rangle$ is the right eigenvector corresponding to the eigenstate with the smallest real part of its complex energy), at $k_y = 0$, is equal to 0 or $\pi$, given that the Berry connection is real. You are given that at $k_x=0$, the Berry connection $A_{k_x}(0) = 0.1$ and at $k_x = \pi$, the Berry connection $A_{k_x}(\pi) = -0.1$. What is the Zak phase?

A system of interacting bosons is described by the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian on a one-dimensional lattice of $L$ sites:

$$H = -t \sum_{i=1}^{L-1} (a_i^\dagger a_{i+1} + a_{i+1}^\dagger a_i) + \frac{U}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{L} n_i(n_i - 1) - \mu \sum_{i=1}^{L} n_i$$

where $a_i^\dagger$ and $a_i$ are the creation and annihilation operators for a boson on site $i$, $n_i = a_i^\dagger a_i$ is the number operator, $t$ is the hopping amplitude, $U$ is the on-site interaction strength, and $\mu$ is the chemical potential.

The system is initialized in a Mott insulator state with one boson per site ($n_i = 1$ for all $i$). A quantum quench is performed by suddenly changing the chemical potential from $\mu_0$ to $\mu_f$. After the quench, the system evolves unitarily according to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation.

Using the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) method with a matrix product state (MPS) representation, we want to investigate the real-time dynamics. For the TEBD algorithm, one typically decomposes the time evolution operator $e^{-i H \Delta t}$ into a product of two-site gates using a Suzuki-Trotter decomposition. Suppose the system has parameters $L = 10$, $t = 1$, $U = 5$, $\mu_0 = 4$, $\mu_f = 2$. Given a target accuracy such that the truncation error after evolving for a time $t_f=10$ should be below $10^{-4}$, and knowing that the entanglement entropy after the quench grows linearly with a rate of approximately $s=0.5$, estimate the minimum required bond dimension $\chi$ for the MPS representation to achieve this accuracy. Assume that the bond dimension scales exponentially with the entanglement entropy.
