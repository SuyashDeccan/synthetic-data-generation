<question>Consider a composite Higgs model where the Higgs boson arises as a pseudo-Nambu–Goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken global symmetry at scale $f$. Assume the Higgs potential is generated radiatively via loops of a neutral top partner with mass $M_T$ that couples to the Higgs with Yukawa coupling $y_T$. Derive the leading-order expression for the Higgs self-coupling deviation $\delta \lambda = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_\text{SM}} - 1$ in terms of $f$, $M_T$, $y_T$, and the SM top Yukawa $y_t$, assuming the dominant contribution arises from the top partner induced Coleman-Weinberg potential and that $f \gg v$ where $v$ is the electroweak vev.</question>

<question>In a relaxion mechanism model addressing the cosmological constant problem, the relaxion field $\phi$ couples to the Higgs sector with an effective potential of the form $V(\phi,h) = (g \Lambda^3 \phi - \Lambda^2) h^2 + \Lambda^4 b(\phi)$, where $\Lambda$ is the UV cutoff scale, $g$ a small dimensionless coupling, and $b(\phi)$ is a periodic backreaction potential with period $f_\phi$. Assuming the electroweak vacuum is selected dynamically when the relaxion stops rolling, derive an expression for the final Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$ in terms of $g$, $\Lambda$, $f_\phi$, and the slope of $b(\phi)$ near the stopping point, characterized by $b'(\phi_0)$.</question>

<question>Consider a theory exhibiting UV/IR mixing in a noncommutative field theory context, where the nonlocal scale is set by $\theta^{\mu\nu}$ with magnitude $\theta$. Given that the effective low-energy coupling constant $g_\text{eff}(p)$ runs not only with the momentum scale $p$ but also depends inversely on the noncommutative parameter as $g_\text{eff}(p) = g_0 \left(1 + \frac{\Lambda_\text{UV}^2}{p^2 + \Lambda_\text{IR}^2}\right)$, with $\Lambda_\text{UV} \sim 1/\sqrt{\theta}$ and $\Lambda_\text{IR}$ a fixed IR cutoff, derive a simplified expression describing the momentum scale $p_c$ where UV effects dominate and determine how $p_c$ scales with $\Lambda_\text{UV}$ and $\Lambda_\text{IR}$.</question>

<question>In a neutral naturalness model, the Higgs mass is stabilized by a twin sector containing mirror top partners with Yukawa coupling $y'_t$ and mass scale $M'$. Assuming the leading quadratic correction to the Higgs mass parameter in the visible sector arises at two loops mediated by gauge bosons with coupling $g$ that couple identically to both sectors, derive the symbolic dependence of the correction $\delta m_H^2$ on $y'_t$, $g$, $M'$, and the UV cutoff $\Lambda$, considering the suppression due to the neutral nature of the partners in QCD interactions.</question>

<question>Analyze a cosmological constant problem inspired scenario where a scalar field $\varphi$ couples linearly to vacuum energy density $\rho_\Lambda$ with an interaction term $\xi \varphi \rho_\Lambda$. Considering that $\varphi$ itself has a potential $V(\varphi) = \frac{1}{2} m^2 \varphi^2 + \frac{\lambda}{4} \varphi^4$ and that $\varphi$ dynamically screens the cosmological constant in the vacuum defined by minimizing the effective potential $V_\text{eff}(\varphi) = V(\varphi) + \xi \varphi \rho_\Lambda$, derive the equilibrium value $\varphi_0$ minimizing $V_\text{eff}$ as a function of $m$, $\lambda$, $\xi$, and $\rho_\Lambda$.</question>

<question>Within the framework of composite Higgs models, consider a fermionic top partner with mass $M_\Psi$ transforming in the fundamental representation of the global symmetry broken to produce the Higgs as a pseudo-Goldstone boson. Assuming that the effective Higgs potential includes contributions proportional to $y_t^2 M_\Psi^2 / f^2$, where $f$ is the compositeness scale, derive the expression for the lightest Higgs mass $m_h$ in terms of $y_t$, $M_\Psi$, $f$, and the electroweak vev $v$, treating the Higgs mass as arising from the interplay of explicit symmetry breaking and partial compositeness.</question>
=== Turn 0: Critic feedback ===
Certainly. Here is a concise,  actionable critique of each question using the provided guidelines:

---

**Question 1 (Composite Higgs, $\delta\lambda$ via top partner loop)**

**Strengths:**
- Models a plausible BSM scenario.
- Clearly defines the physical quantity to derive ($\delta\lambda$).
- Multi-step reasoning is needed (Coleman-Weinberg potential, symmetry breaking, leading order extraction).
- Unique, not a textbook question.
- Unambiguous, single symbolic result targeted.
- Variables and notation are standard.

**Areas to Improve:**
- **Assumptions:** The phrase "Assume the dominant contribution arises from the top partner induced Coleman-Weinberg potential and that $f \gg v$" is reasonable, but clarify if SM top loops are included or neglected. Make explicit: "Neglect all contributions except for the neutral top partner."
- **Redundancy:** The mention of both $M_T$ and $y_T$ and also referencing $y_t$ could be more direct: specify whether $y_t$ (the SM top) enters at all.
- **Colloquialisms:** "Loops of a neutral top partner" could be more precisely phrased: "radiative corrections from a neutral top partner fermion."
- **Model Specifics:** State which global symmetry breaking pattern is considered, or make it generic.
- **Units:** All parameters have consistent units.

**Action:** Slightly clarify the assumptions about which loop contributions are included.

---

**Question 2 (Relaxion $v$ in terms of $b'(\phi_0)$)**

**Strengths:**
- Real modern scenario, not textbook.
- Seeks a concrete quantity ($v$).
- Requires application of potential minimization and backreaction physics.
- Clear, single final symbolic result.
- Standard units and notation.
- Succinct.

**Areas to Improve:**
- **Assumptions:** "Assuming the electroweak vacuum is selected dynamically when the relaxion stops rolling" could be more explicit. Do not require the solver to guess what physical condition pins down $v$. Suggest: "Assume $\phi$ stops at $\phi_0$ such that $\partial_\phi V(\phi_0, v)=0$ and the Higgs vev is the minimum of the effective potential at that point."
- **Extraneous variables:** All parameters listed are required.
- **Ambiguity:** Define "slope of $b$" (i.e., is $b'(\phi_0)$ with respect to $\phi$?).

**Action:** State precisely the physical stopping condition for $\phi$ to eliminate interpretive ambiguity.

---

**Question 3 (UV/IR mixing noncommutative $p_c$ scaling)**

**Strengths:**
- Advanced, nontrivial context.
- Directly targets symbolic result ($p_c$).
- Multi-step: requires analyzing running and matching scales.
- Not a textbook exercise.
- Units and notation appropriate.
- No ambiguity in requested answer.

**Areas to Improve:**
- **Extraneous variables:** The explicit $g_0$ is not necessary for the location where UV effects dominate, unless required for definition.
- **Assumptions:** Specify unambiguously what is meant by "UV effects dominate" — perhaps define it as the scale where the second term equals 1, or $g_\text{eff}$ doubles.
- **Phraseology:** "Magnitude $\theta$" could be ambiguous; state $\theta$ is defined as $|\theta^{\mu\nu}|$.
- **Modeling:** Not redundant, but make clear exactly what is being held fixed.

**Action:** Explicitly define criterion for "UV effects dominate" (e.g., $g_\text{eff} = 2g_0$) and clarify the meaning/role of each variable.

---

**Question 4 (Neutral naturalness, twin top partners and two-loop correction)**

**Strengths:**
- Modern and original scenario.
- Targets a symbolic expression for $\delta m_H^2$ in terms of explicit parameters.
- Requires multi-step reasoning (two-loop, symmetry, matching).
- Single answer, not ambiguous.
- Notation and units correct.

**Areas to Improve:**
- **Assumptions:** "Suppression due to the neutral nature of the partners in QCD interactions" may be vague — state more precisely what is omitted or included (e.g., "Assume twin sector has no SM QCD interactions and that only SM gauge bosons mediate correction").
- **Redundancy:** All parameters needed.

**Action:** Clarify the suppressed diagrams by precisely stating which couplings are present/absent.

---

**Question 5 (Scalar field screens $\rho_\Lambda$ via linear coupling)**

**Strengths:**
- Interesting framework, not standard.
- Requests a single symbolic result for $\varphi_0$.
- Involves multi-step minimization.
- Variables given are sufficient and necessary.
- Phraseology and units are correct.

**Areas to Improve:**
- **Ambiguity:** The phrase "dynamically screens the cosmological constant ..." is slightly narrative; simply state: "Find the value $\varphi_0$ minimizing $V_\text{eff}$."
- **No extraneous variables.
- **Standard notation.**

**Action:** Phrase more concisely: "Find the value $\varphi_0$ minimizing $V_\text{eff}$ in terms of $m,\lambda,\xi,\rho_\Lambda$."

---

**Question 6 (Composite Higgs with fermionic top partner, $m_h$ expression)**

**Strengths:**
- Scenario is advanced and non-textbook.
- Targets a single symbolic result ($m_h$).
- Requires multi-step reasoning about representation, symmetry, and explicit breaking.
- Parameters and notation are standard.

**Areas to Improve:**
- **Assumptions:** The phrase "interplay of explicit symmetry breaking and partial compositeness" is not specific. State explicitly which contributions to $m_h$ to include.
- **Extraneous variables:** All listed variables are relevant.
- **Ambiguity:** Ensure choice of whether only leading order in $v/f$ is needed, or all orders.
- **Model setup:** State if $y_t$ is a partially composite parameter or entirely emergent from mixing.
- **Units and symbols are correct.**

**Action:** State precisely which contributions to $m_h$ to include and whether to work at leading order in $v/f$.

# **Overall Actionable Feedback**
1. **Clarify Physical Assumptions:** Explicitly state which effects/contributions should be included or neglected to ensure there is only a single possible solution path.
2. **Define Criteria Precisely:** For vague terms ("dominant contributions," "suppression," "when UV effects dominate"), provide precise mathematical or physical definitions.
3. **Avoid Narrative or Colloquial Phrasing:** Replace with direct instructions (e.g., "find $\varphi_0$ that minimizes $V_\text{eff}$").
4. **State All Assumptions Needed for the Solution:** This prevents the solver from needing extraneous, unstated background knowledge.
5. **Verify No Redundant Variables:** Include only those variables necessary for solving; clarify notation as needed.
6. **Standardize notation and units:** All question symbols should match conventional use; units/dimensions should be internally consistent.
7. **Keep questions atomic:** Each question must have only one single symbolic quantity as its goal.

**Applying these will make the questions even more rigorous and assessment-ready at a graduate level.**

<question>Consider a composite Higgs model in which the Higgs boson arises as a pseudo-Nambu–Goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken global symmetry at compositeness scale $f$, with $f \gg v$, the electroweak vacuum expectation value. Assume the Higgs potential is generated radiatively solely by the Coleman-Weinberg potential from a neutral top partner fermion of mass $M_T$ coupling to the Higgs with Yukawa coupling $y_T$. Neglect all other contributions, including SM top loops. Derive the leading-order expression for the Higgs self-coupling deviation
\[
\delta \lambda = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_{\rm SM}} - 1,

expressed symbolically in terms of $f$, $M_T$, $y_T$, and the SM top Yukawa coupling $y_t$ (where $y_t$ enters only as a parameter), with consistent assumptions and approximations.</question>

<question>In a relaxion mechanism addressing the electroweak hierarchy problem, the relaxion field $\phi$ couples to the Higgs field $h$ with an effective potential
\[
V(\phi,h) = (g \Lambda^3 \phi - \Lambda^2) h^2 + \Lambda^4 b(\phi),
\]
where $\Lambda$ is the UV cutoff scale, $g \ll 1$ is a dimensionless coupling, and $b(\phi)$ is a periodic backreaction potential with period $f_\phi$. Assume the relaxion stops rolling at $\phi = \phi_0$, defined by the condition that both
\[
\frac{\partial V}{\partial \phi}(\phi_0, v) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial V}{\partial h}( \phi_0, v ) = 0,

<question>Consider a noncommutative field theory exhibiting UV/IR mixing characterized by a noncommutative parameter $\theta^{\mu\nu}$ with magnitude $\theta = |\theta^{\mu\nu}|$, defining an effective UV scale $\Lambda_{\rm UV} \sim 1/\sqrt{\theta}$. The effective momentum-dependent coupling is given by
\[
g_{\rm eff}(p) = g_0 \left( 1 + \frac{\Lambda_{\rm UV}^2}{p^2 + \Lambda_{\rm IR}^2} \right),
\]
where $\Lambda_{\rm IR}$ is a fixed IR cutoff scale. Define the momentum scale $p_c$ at which the UV modification doubles the coupling, i.e., $g_{\rm eff}(p_c) = 2 g_0$. Derive a simplified expression for $p_c$ and determine how it scales with $\Lambda_{\rm UV}$ and $\Lambda_{\rm IR}$.</question>

<question>In a neutral naturalness framework, the Higgs mass parameter in the visible sector receives two-loop quadratic corrections mediated by gauge bosons coupling identically to both the visible and twin sectors. The twin sector contains color-neutral mirror top partners with mass scale $M'$ and Yukawa coupling $y'_t$. Assume that QCD interactions do not couple to the twin sector and that only the SM gauge bosons with coupling $g$ mediate corrections between sectors.

<question>Consider a scalar field $\varphi$ coupling linearly to the vacuum energy density $\rho_\Lambda$ via interaction term $\xi \varphi \rho_\Lambda$. The scalar has a potential
\[
V(\varphi) = \frac{1}{2} m^2 \varphi^2 + \frac{\lambda}{4} \varphi^4,
\]
and the effective potential incorporating the coupling to vacuum energy is
\[
V_{\rm eff}(\varphi) = V(\varphi) + \xi \varphi \rho_\Lambda.

<question>Within a composite Higgs model, consider a fermionic top partner $\Psi$ with mass $M_\Psi$ transforming in the fundamental representation of the global symmetry group spontaneously broken at scale $f$, giving rise to the Higgs as a pseudo-Goldstone boson. Assuming the effective Higgs potential receives leading contributions proportional to $y_t^2 M_\Psi^2 / f^2$, where $y_t$ is the SM top Yukawa coupling and $v$ the electroweak vev, derive the symbolic expression for the lightest Higgs boson mass $m_h$ in terms of $y_t$, $M_\Psi$, $f$, and $v$. Work at leading order in the expansion parameter $v/f$, and assume that $m_h$ arises from explicit symmetry breaking encoded by partial compositeness.</question>

**Question 1**  
*Composite Higgs, Coleman-Weinberg, self-coupling deviation*

**Feedback:**
- **Strengths:**  
  - Models an advanced, real (albeit idealized) BSM scenario.  
  - Targets a clear symbolic solution for $\delta\lambda$.  
  - Requires a multi-step derivation using field theory concepts.  
  - Variables needed all appear to contribute to the solution.
  - The question is non-standard and original.
  - Clear LaTeX formatting and concise scientific language.
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - Assumptions are stated ("neglect all other contributions"), but the instruction to "express symbolically...with consistent assumptions and approximations" leaves some ambiguity about which approximations to use, potentially leading to diverging answers unless the leading order in $v/f$ is specified.
  - Use of "the Higgs potential is generated radiatively solely..." could be interpreted as excluding any tree-level term, but could be even clearer.
  - The question should explicitly state "work at leading order in $v/f$ expansion" if higher powers are negligible.
  - "Where $y_t$ enters only as a parameter"—ambiguous wording; simply state all parameters needed for the answer.
- **Actionable Improvements:**  
  - Specify: "Work at leading order in $v/f$."  
  - Instead of "with consistent assumptions and approximations," state explicitly: "Assume the leading order in $v/f$ and neglect all other subleading corrections."  
  - Tighten "where $y_t$ enters only as a parameter" to "where $y_t$ is treated as a fixed parameter and all physical quantities are to be expressed in terms of $f$, $M_T$, $y_T$, and $y_t$."

---

**Question 2**  
*Relaxion mechanism, Higgs VEV*

**Feedback:**
- **Strengths:**  
  - Realistic physical context (relaxion scenario).
  - Explicit symbolic solution for $v$ targeted.
  - Forces use of derivatives, system of equations—multi-step problem.
  - Original scenario, not found in textbooks.
  - LaTeX and notation are clean.
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - $b(\phi)$'s periodicity and properties are sketched generally; the solution depends on $b'(\phi_0)$, but the meaning of this derivative is not spelled out until after the condition is presented.
  - Simultaneous solution requires some careful reading; perhaps the fact that only 1 expression for $v$ is expected should be emphasized.
  - Units of $g$ ($g \ll 1$ "dimensionless") are not entirely standard—sometimes $g$ can accompany $f_\phi$ or have different units.
  - No unnecessary variables; all required.
- **Actionable Improvements:**  
  - State: "Assume $g$ is a dimensionless constant."  
  - Explicitly clarify: "Express your answer for $v$ in terms of $g$, $\Lambda$, $f_\phi$, and $b'(\phi_0)$ only."  
  - State: "You do not need to specify the form of $b(\phi)$, but treat $b'(\phi_0)$ as a known parameter."
  - Ensure that only 1 expression is required by stating "derive an explicit expression for the Higgs vev $v$..."

**Question 3**  
*Noncommutative theory, effective coupling doubling*

**Feedback:**
- **Strengths:**  
  - Well-defined, targeted calculation (find $p_c$).
  - Unambiguous definition.
  - Multi-step mathematical and physical reasoning required.
  - All variables used; all necessary for solution.
  - Severe original scenario.
  - Consistent notation and units.
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - The relationship $\theta = |\theta^{\mu\nu}|$ is ambiguous; suggest specifying "$\theta$ is a parameter with dimensions of [mass]$^{-2}$".
  - The phrase "determine how [the answer] scales with" could invite qualitative answers; to maintain uniqueness, say, "express your answer..."
  - $\Lambda_{\rm UV} \sim 1/\sqrt{\theta}$—if $\Lambda_{\rm UV}$ is defined this way, perhaps only use $\Lambda_{\rm UV}$ in the derivation and say it's related to $\theta$.
- **Actionable Improvements:**  
  - Replace "determine how it scales..." with "express $p_c$ explicitly in terms of $\Lambda_{\rm UV}$ and $\Lambda_{\rm IR}$".
  - Clarify units of $\theta$.
  - State clearly: "Provide a single symbolic expression for $p_c$."

---

**Question 4**  
*Neutral naturalness, Higgs mass correction scaling*

**Feedback:**
- **Strengths:**  
  - Engages real, advanced BSM mechanism.
  - Targets a symbolic expression for $\delta m_H^2$.
  - Requires combining multiple physics concepts for derivation.
  - All variables are relevant.
  - Clean, rigorous language.
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - "Symbolic leading dependence" could be ambiguous—should state "leading parametric dependence" or "leading order in $y'_t$, $g$, $M'$, and $\Lambda$."
  - The phrase "explicitly reflecting suppression..." could be interpreted variably—maybe ask directly for the parametric $y'_t^2 g^4 / (16\pi^4)$ scaling.
  - The dependence on $\Lambda$ should be explicit ("leading quadratic," etc.).
- **Actionable Improvements:**  
  - Rephrase: "Derive the leading order symbolic expression for the Higgs mass correction $\delta m_H^2$ in terms of $y'_t$, $g$, $M'$, and $\Lambda$, displaying all dependence on these variables."
  - State clearly: "Provide only a single symbolic expression."

---

**Question 5**  
*Scalar coupled to vacuum energy, equilibrium value*

**Feedback:**
- **Strengths:**  
  - Realistic physical principle.
  - Demands explicit symbolic $\varphi_0$ in terms of all parameters.
  - Multi-step derivation (minimization).
  - All variables required and used.
  - Clear and concise language.
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - None. This is perhaps the most conformant of all with guidelines.
- **Actionable Improvements:**  
  - Consider stating "Assume $\lambda>0$ and $m \neq 0$" for uniqueness of solution, but this is usually implied.

---

**Question 6**  
*Composite Higgs, top partner, mass formula*

**Feedback:**
- **Strengths:**  
  - Realistic (BSM scenario with partial compositeness).
  - Demands explicit symbolic result for $m_h$.
  - Multi-step derivation needed (identifying coefficient, expansion).
  - All variables clearly useful.
  - Original scenario, not a copy of textbook problem.
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - "Effective Higgs potential receives leading contributions proportional to $y_t^2 M_\Psi^2 / f^2$"—although only $y_t$, $M_\Psi$, $f$, and $v$ appear, it does not state whether any constant of proportionality is to be provided, if needed.
  - Units not explicitly called out, but are standard.
  - Assumptions could be further consolidated ("work at leading order in $v/f$").
- **Actionable Improvements:**  
  - Explicitly state: "Work at leading order in $v/f$, neglecting higher order corrections."  
  - Specify if dimensionless numerical prefactors are expected or if only the parametric dependence is required.

# **Summary Table**

| # | Main Issues | Actionable Changes |
|---|-------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Minor approximation/assumption ambiguity | Specify order in $v/f$; clarify symbolic requested form |
| 2 | Clarity on function derivatives and answer's uniqueness | Specify $g$ unit, clarify required form of $v$ |

**General Recommendations Across All Questions**
- Ensure every variable in the statement is needed for the solution.
- Ensure each question requests only a *single* symbolic answer, and that wording is explicit about this.
- Use precise language on assumptions, e.g. "work at leading order in $v/f$."
- Define all symbols and parameter units, especially for nonstandard or scenario-specific symbols.
- Avoid "how does $X$ scale..." in favor of "derive an explicit symbolic expression for $X$ in terms of ..."
- Prefer unambiguous formulas over qualitative descriptors.
- Check that only one derivation path is possible when correctly following instructions.

**If you correct these minor language and clarity issues, your questions are highly original, challenging, and conform well to modern assessment best practices.**

Sure! Here is a concise critique for each question, organized point-by-point following your guidelines:

### **Question 1: Composite Higgs, Top Partner, $\delta \lambda$**

**Strengths:**  
- Presents a modern beyond-SM scenario with well-defined model context.
- Explicitly identifies all parameters and expects a single symbolic expression for $\delta\lambda$.
- Requires multi-step reasoning (Coleman–Weinberg, matching, expansion in $v/f$).
- Variables are standard/notationally consistent.

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- **Redundancy:** The phrase “neglect all other contributions, including SM top loops, and assume no tree-level Higgs potential terms” is somewhat redundant with “only the top partner contribution.”
- **Assumption Clarity:** The question requires the student to assume that $v$ is set solely by the minimum of the radiatively generated potential, but doesn't say so explicitly.
- **Physical Model Validity:** By neglecting SM contributions and focusing solely on the neutral top partner, the setup is idealized, but this should be stated more formally if the question outcome strongly depends on this.
- **Single Solution:** Well posed here; no ambiguities.
- **Clarity:** The term “at leading order in $v/f$” should specify to expand only $\delta\lambda$ to that order.

**Actionable Improvements:**  
- Explicitly state that “assume $v$ is entirely determined by the radiatively generated potential.”
- Remove redundant “including SM top loops.”
- Change "Work at leading order in the expansion parameter $v/f$” to “Expand $\delta\lambda$ to leading order in $v/f$.”

### **Question 2: Relaxion, Higgs VEV**

**Strengths:**  
- Presents a novel, research-level scenario; the variable asked for ($v$) is clear.
- Requires two-step minimization with respect to $\phi$ and $h$.
- All symbols and variables defined.
- Variables in the final answer are clearly specified.

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- **Assumptions:** Asks for “explicit expression” in terms of $g$, $\Lambda$, $f_\phi$, and $b'(\phi_0)$ only, but $v$ might generically depend on more parameters unless the relationships in the potential are fully specified — however, the minimization conditions should suffice.
- **Single Solution:** The double minimization uniquely fixes $v$ in terms of the given parameters; this is fine.
- **Complexity/Originality:** Unique, not a textbook problem.

**Actionable Improvements:**  
- To further clarify, rephrase as: “Express $v$ solely as a function of the stated parameters, with all other quantities eliminated using the minimization conditions.”
- Consider noting that “you may treat $b'(\phi_0)$ as a given symbol” to avoid ambiguity.

### **Question 3: Noncommutative Theory, $p_c$ Where Coupling Doubles**

**Strengths:**  
- Well specified, unique UV/IR context, with precise variable and parameters.
- Multi-step (algebraic manipulation, recognize physical content).
- Standard notation, dimensional analysis straightforward.

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- **Redundancy:** Defining both $\theta$ and $\Lambda_{\mathrm{UV}}$ is justifiable, but could just say $\Lambda_{\mathrm{UV}}\equiv1/\sqrt{\theta}$ once.
- **Assumption Clarity:** No problematic or implicit assumptions.
- **Units:** Consistent.

**Actionable Improvements:**  
- Briefly state that all parameters can be treated as strictly positive and real.
- Remove the "having mass dimension..." phrase or put it in parentheses to streamline.

---

### **Question 4: Neutral Naturalness, Higgs Mass Correction**

**Strengths:**  
- Well-designed unique scenario, definitely not textbook.
- Requires understanding of 2-loop diagrams, coupling structure, and the logic of neutral naturalness.
- Explicit in which variables answer should depend on.

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- **Assumptions:** Phrases like "Assume QCD interactions do not couple to the twin sector" are fine, but question could be more assertive, e.g., "The twin sector is QCD neutral by construction."
- **Units/Clarity:** All variables have standard meaning, units unambiguous.
- **Information:** Students might wonder how much detail is expected in the final expression—whether full 2-loop factors or just the scaling. Clarify the level of "leading-order symbolic" required—is $g^4 y_t'^2 \Lambda^2/(16\pi^4)$ sufficient?

**Actionable Improvements:**  
- Specify whether only the **parametric** dependence is required (i.e., up to a $16\pi^4$ factor), or if exact 2-loop coefficients should be included.
- Rephrase the assumption: "By construction, QCD interactions are absent from the twin sector."

---

### **Question 5: Scalar Coupling Linearly to Vacuum Energy**

**Strengths:**  
- Clear, unambiguous scenario; variable to solve for ($\varphi_0$) is precise.
- Multi-step (minimize potential, solve cubic equation).
- All variables are defined.

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- **Assumptions:** While $\lambda > 0$ and $m \neq 0$ are stated, could clarify sign and restrict to $m^2 > 0$ unless tachyonic mass is intended.
- **Physical Validity:** The context is highly idealized (linear coupling to vacuum energy) but that is acceptable for theory problems.

**Actionable Improvements:**  
- Clarify whether $m^2 > 0$, or let $m$ be any real nonzero number, but then warn that stability requires $m^2 > 0$.
- Remove “equilibrium value” which is ambiguous; instead, say “global minimum.”

---

### **Question 6: Composite Higgs Mass, Top Partner**

**Strengths:**  
- Unique, non-standard scenario, multi-step reasoning required (from symmetry breaking, identifying mass terms, to linking $m_h$ at leading order).
- All symbols defined, variable to solve for is clear.

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- **Assumption Clarity:** The question says "$m_h$ arises from explicit symmetry breaking encoded by partial compositeness," but does not specify the form of this explicit breaking in $V(h)$. Potentially, more detail is needed to uniquely define $m_h$ in terms of the symbols.
- **Physical Model:** If the relation for $V_{\rm eff}$ is just proportional to $y_t^2 M_\Psi^2/f^2$, this may not (uniquely) fix $m_h$ unless further specified.
- **Solution Uniqueness:** Must ensure that, given the provided relation, the student will reach a single, unambiguous symbolic expression. Otherwise, the task may admit multiple derivations.

**Actionable Improvements:**  
- Explicitly state the relationship between the effective potential and the Higgs field (e.g., $V(h) = (y_t^2 M_\Psi^2/f^2) \sin^2(h/f)$, or otherwise supply the explicit dependence if required for a unique answer).
- Rephrase: “Assume the Higgs mass-squared at leading order is $m_h^2 = \left(\frac{y_t^2 M_\Psi^2 v^2}{f^4}\right)$” (if that is the intended relation), or otherwise provide a minimal working form.
- Clarify what "arises from partial compositeness" means in terms of $V(h)$, to avoid ambiguity.

---

**General Recommendations Across All Questions:**

- **State all working assumptions up front.** Avoid any need for students to make model-dependent choices.
- **Explicitly specify relationship forms if needed** rather than expecting student to infer or choose a plausible ansatz.
- **Minimize redundancy** in statements for brevity and clarity.
- **Whenever ‘leading order’ is invoked, be precise** about which variables the expansion is in and what should be held fixed or neglected.
- **Always define all symbols and parameters** and restrict to those appearing in the answer.
- **Single-answer format:** All questions are well-posed for a unique solution, **provided** that assumption/relationship ambiguities are removed as above.

Consider a composite Higgs model in which the Higgs boson arises as a pseudo-Nambu–Goldstone boson (pNGB) of a spontaneously broken global symmetry at compositeness scale \( f \), with \( f \gg v \), where \( v \) is the electroweak vacuum expectation value (vev). Assume the Higgs potential is generated radiatively solely by the Coleman–Weinberg potential arising from a neutral top partner fermion of mass \( M_T \) coupling to the Higgs with Yukawa coupling \( y_T \). Neglect all other contributions and assume no tree-level Higgs potential terms. Assume that the electroweak scale \( v \) is fully determined by the minimum of this radiatively generated potential. Working at leading order in the expansion parameter \( v/f \), derive the leading-order symbolic expression for the Higgs self-coupling deviation
\[
\delta \lambda = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_{\mathrm{SM}}} - 1,
\]
explicitly expressed in terms of \( f \), \( M_T \), \( y_T \), and the fixed Standard Model top Yukawa coupling \( y_t \). Expand \(\delta \lambda\) to leading order in \( v/f \).

<question>
In a relaxion mechanism addressing the electroweak hierarchy problem, the relaxion field \(\phi\) couples to the Higgs field \(h\) via the effective potential
\[
V(\phi,h) = \left( g \Lambda^3 \phi - \Lambda^{2} \right) h^2 + \Lambda^4 b(\phi),
\]
where \(\Lambda\) is the ultraviolet cutoff scale, \( g \ll 1 \) is a dimensionless coupling, and \( b(\phi) \) is a periodic backreaction potential with period \( f_\phi \). The relaxion stops rolling at \(\phi = \phi_0\), defined by the simultaneous minimization conditions
\[
\frac{\partial V}{\partial \phi}(\phi_0, v) = 0, \quad \frac{\partial V}{\partial h}(\phi_0, v) = 0,
\]
where \( v \) is the Higgs vacuum expectation value at \(\phi_0\). Treating \( b'(\phi_0) \equiv \left. \frac{d b}{d \phi} \right|_{\phi_0} \) as a known parameter, derive an explicit symbolic expression for \( v \) expressed solely in terms of \( g \), \(\Lambda\), \( f_\phi \), and \( b'(\phi_0) \). Use the minimization conditions to eliminate all other variables.

Consider a noncommutative field theory exhibiting UV/IR mixing characterized by an antisymmetric noncommutative parameter \(\theta^{\mu \nu}\) with norm
\[
\theta \equiv \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \theta^{\mu \nu} \theta_{\mu \nu}} > 0,
\]
having mass dimension \([\theta] = -2\). Define an effective ultraviolet scale \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{UV}} \equiv 1/\sqrt{\theta}\). The effective momentum-dependent coupling is
\[
g_{\mathrm{eff}}(p) = g_0 \left( 1 + \frac{\Lambda_{\mathrm{UV}}^2}{p^2 + \Lambda_{\mathrm{IR}}^2} \right),
\]
where \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{IR}} > 0\) is a fixed infrared cutoff scale. Define the momentum scale \( p_c \) at which the coupling doubles:
\[
g_{\mathrm{eff}}(p_c) = 2 g_0.
\]
Derive an explicit symbolic expression for \( p_c \) in terms of \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{UV}}\) and \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{IR}}\) only, assuming all parameters are strictly positive real numbers.

<question>
In a neutral naturalness framework, the visible-sector Higgs mass parameter receives two-loop quadratic corrections mediated by Standard Model gauge bosons coupling identically to both the visible and twin sectors. The twin sector contains color-neutral mirror top partners of mass scale \( M' \) with Yukawa coupling \( y'_t \). By construction, QCD interactions do not couple to the twin sector. Only SM gauge bosons with coupling \( g \) mediate two-loop corrections between sectors. Derive the leading-order parametric symbolic expression for the Higgs mass correction \( \delta m_H^2 \) in terms of \( y'_t \), \( g \), \( M' \), and the ultraviolet cutoff \( \Lambda \), explicitly exhibiting the suppression due to the neutral nature of the twin top partners under QCD. You may express the result up to an overall numerical factor of order unity and state clearly any approximations used.

Consider a real scalar field \(\varphi\) coupling linearly to the vacuum energy density \(\rho_\Lambda\) via the interaction term \(\xi \varphi \rho_\Lambda\). The scalar potential is
\[
V(\varphi) = \frac{1}{2} m^2 \varphi^2 + \frac{\lambda}{4} \varphi^4,
\]
with \( \lambda > 0 \) and \( m^2 > 0 \). The effective potential including coupling to the vacuum energy is
\[
V_{\mathrm{eff}}(\varphi) = V(\varphi) + \xi \varphi \rho_\Lambda.
\]
Derive a symbolic expression for the global minimum \(\varphi_0\) of \( V_{\mathrm{eff}}(\varphi) \) in terms of \( m \), \( \lambda \), \( \xi \), and \( \rho_\Lambda \). Assume all parameters are real and \(\lambda > 0\) ensures stability.
</question>

<question>
Within a composite Higgs model, consider a fermionic top partner \(\Psi\) of mass \( M_\Psi \) transforming in the fundamental representation of the global symmetry group spontaneously broken at scale \( f \), such that the Higgs appears as a pseudo-Nambu–Goldstone boson. Assume the leading contribution to the effective Higgs potential is proportional to
\[
V(h) \propto \frac{y_t^2 M_\Psi^2}{f^2} \sin^2\left( \frac{h}{f} \right),
\]
where \( y_t \) is the Standard Model top Yukawa coupling and \( v \) is the electroweak vev. Working at leading order in the expansion parameter \( v/f \), and assuming the Higgs mass \( m_h \) arises from this explicit symmetry breaking encoded by partial compositeness, derive a symbolic expression for the lightest Higgs boson mass \( m_h \) in terms of \( y_t \), \( M_\Psi \), \( f \), and \( v \). Clearly state any assumptions made and neglect higher-order corrections in \( v/f \).
