Consider a nucleus exhibiting shape coexistence, where the potential energy surface possesses both a prolate and an oblate minimum. The nucleus is modeled using a simplified two-level model, with one prolate state $|\psi_p\rangle$ and one oblate state $|\psi_o\rangle$, separated by an energy difference $\Delta E = E_o - E_p > 0$. These states are coupled by a mixing interaction with strength $V$. Assume that the mixing interaction only connects these two states. What is the energy of the lower-lying eigenstate resulting from the mixing, expressed in terms of $\Delta E$ and $V$?

A heavy nucleus is approximated using the SU(3) symmetry scheme. The quadrupole deformation parameters are $\beta$ and $\gamma$. Suppose a transition occurs where the nucleus evolves from a state with $(\lambda, \mu) = (4, 0)$ to a state with $(\lambda', \mu') = (2, 2)$. Calculate the ratio of the reduced transition probabilities, $B(E2)$, for this transition, assuming the transition operator transforms as a $(\lambda, \mu) = (2, 0)$ tensor. Given that the reduced matrix element $\langle (\lambda',\mu') || T(E2) || (\lambda,\mu) \rangle = C (\lambda, \mu; 2, 0; \lambda', \mu')$, and $C (\lambda, \mu; 2, 0; \lambda', \mu')$ are Clebsch–Gordan coefficients, which can be approximated as 1 for $(\lambda, \mu) = (4, 0)$ to $(\lambda', \mu') = (2, 2)$.

A nucleus is hypothesized to exhibit γ-soft triaxiality. Its energy spectrum is characterized by a sequence of states with energies roughly proportional to $J(J+1)$, where $J$ is the angular momentum. Assuming the Davydov-Filippov model for a γ-soft rotor, with a deformation parameter $\beta = 0.3$, estimate the ratio of the energy of the $4^+$ state to the energy of the $2^+$ state, denoted as $E(4^+)/E(2^+)$.

Consider a nucleus in the O(6) limit of the Interacting Boson Model (IBM). The nucleus undergoes an E2 transition from an initial state $|\tau, \nu, L\rangle = |5, 0, 4\rangle$ to a final state $|\tau', \nu', L'\rangle = |3, 1, 2\rangle$, where $\tau$ is the seniority quantum number, $\nu$ is the number of broken pairs, and $L$ is the angular momentum. Calculate the reduced transition probability $B(E2; 5, 0, 4 \rightarrow 3, 1, 2)$. The $B(E2)$ is given by $B(E2; \tau, \nu, L \rightarrow \tau', \nu', L') = A (N - \tau)(\tau' + 3)(2L'+1)$ where $N$ is the number of bosons, and $A$ is a constant factor, Assume $N=7$.

If the quadrupole moment components are given by $Q_0 = Q \cos(\gamma)$ and $Q_2 = Q \sin(\gamma)$, where $Q$ is the total quadrupole moment. Given an experimentally determined value of $Q = 5 \, e \cdot b$ (where $e$ is the elementary charge and $b$ is the barn unit), calculate the value of the $Q_0$ quadrupole component, in units of $e \cdot b$.

The nucleus is modeled using a simplified two-level model, with one prolate state $|\psi_p\rangle$ and one oblate state $|\psi_o\rangle$, separated by an energy difference $\Delta E = E_o - E_p > 0$.

What is the energy of the lower-lying eigenstate resulting from the mixing, expressed in terms of $\Delta E$ and $V$?
</question>

**Critique:**
This is an excellent question. It successfully models a physics scenario, expects a symbolic answer, forces multi-step reasoning (setting up and diagonalizing a $2 \times 2$ Hamiltonian matrix), is unique in its specific application, has a single correct solution, uses rigorous and concise phrasing without hints, defines all variables and assumptions, uses consistent units and conventional symbols, is not multipart, and is formatted correctly.

**Feedback:**
*   **Overall:** This question adheres very well to all specified guidelines. No significant improvements are needed.

<question>
A heavy nucleus is approximated using the SU(3) symmetry scheme. The quadrupole deformation parameters are $\beta$ and $\gamma$. Suppose a transition occurs where the nucleus evolves from a state with $(\lambda, \mu) = (4, 0)$ to a state with $(\lambda', \mu') = (2, 2)$. Calculate the ratio of the reduced transition probabilities, $B(E2)$, for this transition, assuming the transition operator transforms as a $(\lambda, \mu) = (2, 0)$ tensor. Given that the reduced matrix element $\langle (\lambda',\mu') || T(E2) || (\lambda,\mu) \rangle = C (\lambda, \mu; 2, 0; \lambda', \mu')$, and $C (\lambda, \mu; 2, 0; \lambda', \mu')$ are Clebsch–Gordan coefficients, which can be approximated as $1$ for $(\lambda, \mu) = (4, 0)$ to $(\lambda', \mu') = (2, 2)$.
</question>

**Critique:**
This question has several significant issues.
1.  **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Fails. Providing the reduced matrix element and even approximating the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient as $1$ reduces the problem to a trivial substitution ($B(E2) \propto 1^2$), requiring no actual calculation of coefficients or deep understanding of SU(3) coupling.
2.  **Guideline 5 & 9 (Single Solution / Not Multipart):** Fails. The phrase "Calculate the ratio of the reduced transition probabilities, $B(E2)$, for this transition" is ambiguous. A ratio implies two quantities, but only one transition is described. This leads to confusion on what specific ratio is being asked.
3.  **Guideline 6 (No Hints):** Fails. Stating "which can be approximated as $1$" for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is a direct hint that provides the critical numerical value needed for the solution, bypassing the need for the student to determine it.
4.  **Guideline 7 (All variables defined):** While $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are defined, they are not used in the problem, making their mention superfluous and potentially confusing.

**Feedback:**
*   **Multi-Step Reasoning & No Hints:** Remove the explicit value for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. The student should be expected to either know how to calculate it for SU(3) or refer to a table (if provided in the context of the assessment). This forces a true calculation step.
*   **Clarity & Single Solution:** Rephrase "Calculate the ratio of the reduced transition probabilities..." to "Calculate the reduced transition probability $B(E2)$ for this transition..." if only one transition is intended. If a ratio is truly desired, define the two transitions clearly.
*   **Conciseness:** Remove the mention of $\beta$ and $\gamma$ if they are not used in the calculation.

<question>
A nucleus is hypothesized to exhibit $\gamma$-soft triaxiality. Its energy spectrum is characterized by a sequence of states with energies roughly proportional to $J(J+1)$, where $J$ is the angular momentum. Assuming the Davydov-Filippov model for a $\gamma$-soft rotor, with a deformation parameter $\beta = 0.3$, estimate the ratio of the energy of the $4^+$ state to the energy of the $2^+$ state, denoted as $E(4^+)/E(2^+)$.
</question>

**Critique:**
This question contains a fundamental contradiction that compromises its effectiveness.
1.  **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning) & 5 (Single Solution):** Fails. The statement "energies roughly proportional to $J(J+1)$" implies a simple rigid rotor calculation (ratio of $10/3$). However, mentioning the "Davydov-Filippov model" and "$\gamma$-soft rotor" with a specific "$\beta = 0.3$" suggests a more complex calculation that deviates from the rigid rotor formula. This creates ambiguity: should the student assume the simpler $J(J+1)$ rule, making the model details irrelevant, or attempt to apply the Davydov-Filippov model which requires formulas or tables not provided? This leads to an ambiguous solution.
2.  **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Fails due to the internal contradiction.

**Feedback:**
*   **Clarity & Consistency:** To resolve the contradiction and ensure multi-step reasoning:
    *   **Option 1 (Focus on Davydov-Filippov):** Remove the "energies roughly proportional to $J(J+1)$" statement. Instead, provide the necessary formulas or context about how energy levels are calculated within the Davydov-Filippov model for $\gamma$-soft rotors, or ask about deviations from the rigid rotor expectation. This would make it a multi-step problem using the specified model.
    *   **Option 2 (Focus on Approximation):** If the intent is for the student to use the $J(J+1)$ approximation *despite* the $\gamma$-softness, the question should explicitly state that the rigid rotor approximation should be used for this estimation. However, this weakens the "multi-step" and "unique" aspects related to the specific model.
*   The current phrasing allows for two valid, yet different, interpretations of what is being asked, leading to ambiguity.

<question>
Consider a nucleus in the O(6) limit of the Interacting Boson Model (IBM). The nucleus undergoes an E2 transition from an initial state $|\tau, \nu, L\rangle = |5, 0, 4\rangle$ to a final state $|\tau', \nu', L'\rangle = |3, 1, 2\rangle$, where $\tau$ is the seniority quantum number, $\nu$ is the number of broken pairs, and $L$ is the angular momentum. Calculate the reduced transition probability $B(E2; 5, 0, 4 \rightarrow 3, 1, 2)$. The $B(E2)$ is given by $B(E2; \tau, \nu, L \rightarrow \tau', \nu', L') = A (N - \tau)(\tau' + 3)(2L'+1)$ where $N$ is the number of bosons, and $A$ is a constant factor, Assume $N=7$.
</question>

**Critique:**
This question severely falls short on a key guideline.
1.  **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Fails significantly. The complete formula for $B(E2)$ is provided directly, along with all the required input values. This reduces the problem to a simple arithmetic substitution, requiring no conceptual understanding of the O(6) limit, E2 operators, or the IBM beyond identifying symbols. It does not involve "two or more physical principles or steps".
2.  **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** Fails. This is a standard "plug-and-play" problem, not a unique or conceptually rich scenario in terms of problem-solving.
3.  **Guideline 6 (No Hints):** Fails. Providing the exact formula is a major hint that negates the problem's potential to assess deeper understanding.

**Feedback:**
*   **Multi-Step Reasoning & No Hints:** Remove the explicit formula for $B(E2)$. Instead, the question should require the student to know, derive, or at least apply knowledge of the E2 operator within the O(6) limit of IBM to arrive at the form of $B(E2)$ or its selection rules. For example, specify the E2 operator for O(6) and ask the student to use it to calculate the reduced matrix element. This would transform it from a substitution problem to a genuine physics problem.

<question>
A nucleus is suspected to have a stable triaxial shape with a deformation parameter $\gamma \approx 30^\circ$. If the quadrupole moment components are given by $Q_0 = Q \cos(\gamma)$ and $Q_2 = Q \sin(\gamma)$, where $Q$ is the total quadrupole moment. Given an experimentally determined value of $Q = 5 \, e \cdot b$ (where $e$ is the elementary charge and $b$ is the barn unit), calculate the value of the $Q_0$ quadrupole component, in units of $e \cdot b$.
</question>

**Critique:**
This question is too simple for an advanced physics assessment.
1.  **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Fails. The problem provides the formula directly and all necessary input values. It requires only a single step (substituting values and calculating a cosine), which is basic arithmetic and trigonometry, not multi-step physical reasoning or application of multiple physical principles.

**Feedback:**
*   **Multi-Step Reasoning:** To enhance this question, make it require more than a single substitution. For example:
    *   Do not provide the formulas for $Q_0$ and $Q_2$ directly. Instead, ask the student to relate the quadrupole moment to the shape deformation parameters ($\beta, \gamma$) from fundamental principles (e.g., in a liquid drop model context).
    *   Connect it to an experimentally measurable quantity that *isn't* $Q$ directly (e.g., $B(E2)$ transition probability from which $Q$ might be derived), and then ask for $Q_0$.
    *   Ask for the ratio $Q_2/Q_0$ or other combinations that require manipulation of the given forms or additional conceptual understanding.

A nucleus is suspected to have a stable triaxial shape.

Given an experimentally determined $B(E2; 0^+ \rightarrow 2^+)$ value, and knowing that this is related to the overall deformation parameter $\beta$, determine the value of the ratio $Q_0/Q_2$ for a nucleus with $\gamma \approx 30^\circ$.

**Critique for Question 2:**

`<question>
A heavy nucleus is approximated using the SU(3) symmetry scheme. A transition occurs where the nucleus evolves from a state with $(\lambda, \mu) = (4, 0)$ to a state with $(\lambda', \mu') = (2, 2)$. Calculate the reduced transition probability $B(E2)$ for this transition, assuming the transition operator transforms as a $(\lambda, \mu) = (2, 0)$ tensor. The reduced matrix element is given by $\langle (\lambda',\mu') || T(E2) || (\lambda,\mu) \rangle = C (\lambda, \mu; 2, 0; \lambda', \mu')$, where $C (\lambda, \mu; 2, 0; \lambda', \mu')$ is the appropriate Clebsch–Gordan coefficient.
</question>`

*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** Yes, SU(3) symmetry is used in nuclear models for transitions. (Good)
*   **2. Expect symbolic/numerical answer:** "Calculate $B(E2)$" implies a numerical value, but the information provided makes this ambiguous (see below). (Needs Improvement)
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes, it requires understanding the relation $B(E2) \propto |\langle f || T(E2) || i \rangle|^2$ and applying SU(3) coupling rules. However, to *calculate* a concrete value, more information is missing. (Needs Improvement)
*   **4. Be Unique:** The scenario is unique. (Good)
*   **5. Single Solution:** No. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for SU(3) coupling depends not only on the $(\lambda, \mu)$ representations but also on the angular momentum ($L$) values of the specific states within those representations. The question does not specify $L$ and $L'$ for the initial and final states, making the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient (and thus $B(E2)$) not uniquely determined. (Major Issue)
*   **6. Rigorous, concise phrasing:** "Calculate" is misleading if a numerical value is not uniquely derivable. "Appropriate Clebsch-Gordan coefficient" is vague for an advanced assessment where the exact coefficient calculation is often expected. No hints included. (Needs Improvement)
*   **7. All assumptions clear, variables defined:** Assumptions are clear. Variables are defined. However, crucial state information ($L, L'$) needed for the calculation is missing. (Major Issue)
*   **8. Units consistent, conventional symbols:** Symbols are conventional. If a numerical answer were possible, units for $B(E2)$ ($e^2 \mathrm{fm}^4$) would be needed. (Needs Improvement)
*   **9. Not multipart:** Asks for a single quantity. (Good)
*   **10. Question Formatting:** All inline math is correctly LaTeX-formatted. Correctly wrapped in `<question>...</question>` tags. (Excellent)

**Overall Feedback for Question 2:**
This question has a good conceptual basis but is **flawed due to missing information** that prevents a unique numerical solution for $B(E2)$. The term "calculate" is therefore misleading.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Clarify the expected answer type:** If a symbolic answer in terms of $C$ is acceptable, rephrase to "Express $B(E2)$ in terms of the given Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $C$."
2.  **Provide complete state information:** If a numerical calculation is intended, specify the initial and final angular momentum values (e.g., "from the $L=4$ state in $(\lambda, \mu) = (4, 0)$ to the $L'=2$ state in $(\lambda', \mu') = (2, 2)$"). This would allow students to look up or deduce the specific Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

**Critique for Question 3:**

`<question>
A nucleus is hypothesized to exhibit $\gamma$-soft triaxiality. Assuming the Davydov-Filippov model for a $\gamma$-soft rotor, with a deformation parameter $\beta = 0.3$, and given that the energy of the $2^+$ state is $E(2^+) = A \beta^2$, estimate the energy of the $4^+$ state, $E(4^+)$, assuming $\gamma \approx 30^\circ$ and using the Davydov-Filippov model equations. Express your answer in terms of $A$ and $\beta$. *Note: relevant equations for the Davydov-Filippov model will be provided.*
</question>`

*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** Yes, $\gamma$-soft triaxiality and the Davydov-Filippov model are specific concepts in nuclear structure. (Good)
*   **2. Expect symbolic/numerical answer:** A symbolic expression in terms of $A$ and $\beta$ is expected. (Excellent)
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes. It requires using the given $E(2^+)$ relation to determine a constant within the Davydov-Filippov model and then applying the model's energy equations for the $4^+$ state with the given $\gamma$. (Excellent)
*   **4. Be Unique:** Applying the Davydov-Filippov model with specific parameters to estimate a state's energy is a unique problem. (Good)
*   **5. Single Solution:** Yes, given the equations and parameters, there will be a unique symbolic expression for $E(4^+)$. (Excellent)
*   **6. Rigorous, concise phrasing:** The phrasing is clear and professional. However, the "Note" is a hint and indicates that the question is not fully self-contained as per the guidelines. (Major Issue - "no hints should be provided")
*   **7. All assumptions clear, variables defined:** All assumptions (Davydov-Filippov model, $\gamma \approx 30^\circ$) and variables ($\beta$, $E(2^+)$, $A$) are defined. (Excellent, but the "Note" implies missing information).
*   **8. Units consistent, conventional symbols:** Symbolic answer, so no SI units needed in the final expression. Symbols are conventional. (Excellent)
*   **9. Not multipart:** Asks for a single quantity. (Excellent)
*   **10. Question Formatting:** All inline math is correctly LaTeX-formatted. Correctly wrapped in `<question>...</question>` tags. The "Note" is standard text, but its presence violates the self-contained rule. (Needs Improvement related to guideline 6/10)

**Overall Feedback for Question 3:**
This is a **strong conceptual question**, but it **violates the guideline regarding providing hints** by stating that "relevant equations...will be provided." For an assessment, all necessary information must be *within* the question itself.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Integrate necessary equations:** Remove the "Note." If the Davydov-Filippov model equations are essential, include them directly in the problem statement (e.g., "Given that the Davydov-Filippov model provides energies for $L^+$ states as $E(L, \gamma) = \dots$").

Given that the E2 transition operator in the O(6) limit is proportional to $(d^\dagger s + s^\dagger \tilde{d})$, and that $B(E2) \propto |\langle f || (d^\dagger s + s^\dagger \tilde{d}) || i \rangle|^2$, and assuming $N=7$ bosons, determine the relative reduced transition probability for this transition using the selection rules for $\tau$, $\nu$, and $L$. Provide the answer in terms of a constant $A$.
</question>`

*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** Yes, IBM and the O(6) limit are well-defined nuclear models, and E2 transitions are fundamental. (Excellent)
*   **2. Expect symbolic/numerical answer:** A symbolic answer in terms of $A$ is expected. (Excellent)
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes. It requires identifying the quantum numbers of initial and final states, understanding the E2 operator, and applying the specific selection rules ($\Delta\tau = \pm 1$, $\Delta\nu = \pm 1$, etc.) for the O(6) limit. This leads to recognizing a forbidden transition. (Excellent)
*   **4. Be Unique:** Applying specific selection rules for given states in a particular limit of IBM is a unique problem. (Excellent)
*   **5. Single Solution:** Yes, there is a single, definite answer (zero). (Excellent)
*   **6. Rigorous, concise phrasing:** Clear, professional, and concise. No hints included. (Excellent)
*   **7. All assumptions clear, variables defined:** All assumptions (O(6) limit, E2 operator form, $N=7$ bosons) are stated. All variables ($\tau, \nu, L$, states, $T(E2)$, $B(E2)$, $A$) are defined. (Excellent)
*   **8. Units consistent, conventional symbols:** Symbolic answer, so no SI units needed. Symbols are conventional. (Excellent)
*   **9. Not multipart:** Asks for a single quantity. (Excellent)
*   **10. Question Formatting:** All inline math is correctly LaTeX-formatted. Correctly wrapped in `<question>...</question>` tags. (Excellent)

**Overall Feedback for Question 4:**
This is an **excellent** question. It effectively tests the understanding of selection rules within a specific nuclear model and has a clear, unambiguous solution.

**Critique for Question 5:**

`<question>
A nucleus is suspected to have a stable triaxial shape. Its intrinsic quadrupole moments are related to the deformation parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ by the following expressions: $Q_0 = \sqrt{\frac{16\pi}{5}} Q_2 \beta \cos(\gamma)$ and $Q_2 = \sqrt{\frac{16\pi}{5}} Q_2 \beta \sin(\gamma)$, where $Q_2$ is a scale factor dependent on the nucleus and its mass number. Given an experimentally determined $B(E2; 0^+ \rightarrow 2^+)$ value, and knowing that this is related to the overall deformation parameter $\beta$, determine the value of the ratio $Q_0/Q_2$ for a nucleus with $\gamma \approx 30^\circ$.
</question>`

*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** Yes, triaxial shapes and quadrupole moments are relevant nuclear structure concepts. (Good)
*   **2. Expect symbolic/numerical answer:** A numerical value for the ratio is expected. (Good)
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** The problem, as written, simplifies significantly. If the notation issue (see below) is fixed such that $Q_2$ on the LHS of the second equation is distinct from the scale factor $Q_2$, then the problem becomes simply finding $Q_0/Q_{X} = \cot(\gamma)$. This requires only one conceptual step (forming the ratio and cancelling terms). The $B(E2)$ information is a major distractor and not used. This fails to "force multi-step reasoning" as currently posed. (Major Issue)
*   **4. Be Unique:** The specific expressions are somewhat unique, but the core calculation is trivial once notation is understood. (Needs Improvement)
*   **5. Single Solution:** Yes, if the notation were clear, it would lead to a single numerical value. (Good)
*   **6. Rigorous, concise phrasing:** The phrasing has a **major notation ambiguity**. The symbol $Q_2$ is used for two different quantities: an intrinsic quadrupole moment (on the LHS of the second equation) and a scale factor (on the RHS of both equations). This makes the equations self-referential and confusing. This is a severe violation of clarity and rigorous phrasing. (Major Issue)
*   **7. All assumptions clear, variables defined:** Assumptions are clear. Variables are defined, but $Q_2$ is ambiguously defined/used. The given equations for $Q_0$ and $Q_2$ (the moments themselves) are also not standard representations for intrinsic quadrupole moments, though they might be derived from some specific convention. (Major Issue)
*   **8. Units consistent, conventional symbols:** Symbols are severely ambiguous and non-conventional ($Q_2$ used for two different things). (Major Issue)
*   **9. Not multipart:** Asks for a single quantity. (Good)
*   **10. Question Formatting:** Inline and block math are correctly formatted using LaTeX. However, the ambiguous use of $Q_2$ is a formatting issue related to variable definition. (Major Issue)

**Overall Feedback for Question 5:**
This question is **severely flawed primarily due to ambiguous notation** ($Q_2$ serving two different purposes). It also includes irrelevant information ($B(E2)$) which makes it fail the "force multi-step reasoning" guideline if a simple ratio is the intended solution. If the intent was to use $B(E2)$ to find $\beta$ and then calculate moments, the problem needs a complete re-design.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Crucially, correct the notation:** Use distinct symbols for the intrinsic quadrupole moment (e.g., $Q_{22}$ or $Q_x$) and the scale factor (e.g., $Q_{\text{scale}}$). For instance:
    `$$Q_0 = \sqrt{\frac{16\pi}{5}} Q_{\text{scale}} \beta \cos(\gamma)$$`
    `$$Q_x = \sqrt{\frac{16\pi}{5}} Q_{\text{scale}} \beta \sin(\gamma)$$`
    Then ask for $Q_0/Q_x$.
2.  **Verify or clarify the equations:** Ensure these equations for $Q_0$ and $Q_x$ are standard or explicitly define their origin.
3.  **Address the multi-step reasoning and distractor:**
    *   If the goal is just $\cot(\gamma)$, remove the $B(E2)$ information as it's a distractor and makes the question too simple for "multi-step reasoning."
    *   If multi-step reasoning is desired and involves $B(E2)$ and $\beta$, then the question must be re-designed to *require* their calculation/use. For example: "Given an experimentally determined $B(E2; 0^+ \rightarrow 2^+)$ value, which is related to $\beta$ by $B(E2; 0^+ \rightarrow 2^+) = C \beta^2$ (where $C$ is a constant), first determine $\beta$. Then, for $\gamma \approx 30^\circ$, calculate the ratio $Q_0/Q_x$ using the given equations..." (providing the relevant equations with correct notation).

<question>
Consider a nucleus exhibiting shape coexistence, where the potential energy surface possesses both a prolate and an oblate minimum. The nucleus is modeled using a simplified two-level model, with one prolate state $|\psi_p\rangle$ and one oblate state $|\psi_o\rangle$, separated by an energy difference $\Delta E = E_o - E_p > 0$. These states are coupled by a mixing interaction with strength $V$. Assume that the mixing interaction only connects these two states. What is the energy of the lower-lying eigenstate resulting from the mixing, expressed in terms of $\Delta E$ and $V$?

A heavy nucleus is approximated using the SU(3) symmetry scheme. A transition occurs where the nucleus evolves from a state with $(\lambda, \mu) = (4, 0), L=4$ to a state with $(\lambda', \mu') = (2, 2), L'=2$. Calculate the reduced transition probability $B(E2)$ for this transition, assuming the transition operator transforms as a $(\lambda, \mu) = (2, 0)$ tensor. The reduced matrix element is given by $\langle (\lambda',\mu'), L' || T(E2) || (\lambda,\mu), L \rangle = C ((\lambda, \mu), L; (2, 0), 2; (\lambda', \mu'), L')$, where $C ((\lambda, \mu), L; (2, 0), 2; (\lambda', \mu'), L')$ is the appropriate Clebsch–Gordan coefficient. Express your answer in terms of $C$.

A nucleus is hypothesized to exhibit γ-soft triaxiality. Assuming the Davydov-Filippov model for a γ-soft rotor, with a deformation parameter $\beta = 0.3$, and given that the energy of the $2^+$ state is $E(2^+) = A \beta^2$, estimate the energy of the $4^+$ state, $E(4^+)$, assuming $\gamma \approx 30^\circ$ and using the Davydov-Filippov model. The energies of the $2^+$ and $4^+$ states in the Davydov-Filippov model are given by: $E(2^+) = \frac{1}{2} A \beta^2 (3 - \sqrt{9 - 8 \sin^2 \gamma})$ and $E(4^+) = \frac{1}{2} A \beta^2 (2\sqrt{9 - 8 \sin^2 \gamma})$. Express your answer in terms of $A$ and $\beta$.

Consider a nucleus in the O(6) limit of the Interacting Boson Model (IBM). The nucleus undergoes an E2 transition from an initial state $|\tau, \nu, L\rangle = |5, 0, 4\rangle$ to a final state $|\tau', \nu', L'\rangle = |3, 1, 2\rangle$, where $\tau$ is the seniority quantum number, $\nu$ is the number of broken pairs, and $L$ is the angular momentum. Given that the E2 transition operator in the O(6) limit is proportional to $(d^\dagger s + s^\dagger \tilde{d})$, and that $B(E2) \propto |\langle f || (d^\dagger s + s^\dagger \tilde{d}) || i \rangle|^2$, and assuming $N=7$ bosons, determine the relative reduced transition probability for this transition using the selection rules for $\tau$, $\nu$, and $L$. Provide the answer in terms of a constant $A$.

A nucleus is suspected to have a stable triaxial shape. Its intrinsic quadrupole moments $Q_0$ and $Q_x$ are related to the deformation parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ by the following expressions:
$$Q_0 = \sqrt{\frac{16\pi}{5}} Q_{\text{scale}} \beta \cos(\gamma)$$
$$Q_x = \sqrt{\frac{16\pi}{5}} Q_{\text{scale}} \beta \sin(\gamma)$$
where $Q_{\text{scale}}$ is a scale factor dependent on the nucleus and its mass number. Determine the value of the ratio $Q_0/Q_x$ for a nucleus with $\gamma \approx 30^\circ$.
