<question>  
Consider a scalar field $\phi$ in the Standard Model with a Wilsonian effective Lagrangian valid up to a cutoff scale $\Lambda$, where quantum corrections induce a mass term  
$$m_H^2(\Lambda) = m_0^2 + \frac{\kappa}{16\pi^2} \Lambda^2,$$  
with $m_0^2$ the bare Higgs mass squared and $\kappa$ a positive constant dependent on couplings. Assuming the physical Higgs mass squared $m_H^2(\mu)$ at the electroweak scale $\mu \ll \Lambda$ is fixed, express the necessary fine-tuning condition $\Delta$ defined by  
$$\Delta = \left| \frac{\delta m_H^2}{m_H^2(\mu)} \right| = \left| \frac{m_H^2(\Lambda) - m_H^2(\mu)}{m_H^2(\mu)} \right|,$$  
in terms of $\Lambda$, $m_H(\mu)$, and $\kappa$, assuming $m_0^2$ is adjusted to cancel the quadratic divergence up to scale $\Lambda$. Derive the symbolic expression for $\Delta$ explicitly and discuss its dependence on $\Lambda$ and $m_H(\mu)$.

<question>  
Within the framework of the Standard Model effective field theory, consider the one-loop corrected Higgs potential at scale $\mu$ given by  
$$V_{\mathrm{eff}}(h) = -\frac{1}{2} m^2(\mu) h^2 + \frac{\lambda(\mu)}{4} h^4 + \frac{3}{64\pi^2} y_t^4 h^4 \ln \left( \frac{y_t^2 h^2}{\mu^2} \right),$$  
where $h$ is the real Higgs field, $y_t$ is the top Yukawa coupling, and $m^2(\mu), \lambda(\mu)$ are running parameters. Find the condition on $h = v$ that satisfies  
$$\frac{dV_{\mathrm{eff}}}{dh}\bigg|_{h=v} = 0,$$  
and express $v$ implicitly or explicitly in terms of $m^2(\mu), \lambda(\mu), y_t,$ and $\mu$. 

</question>

<question>  
The Little Hierarchy Problem concerns the stability of the Higgs mass under radiative corrections given multiple mass scales. Consider a new physics scale $M \gg m_H$ that induces a threshold correction to the Higgs mass squared at scale $\mu \approx M$:  
$$\delta m_H^2 \sim \frac{g^2}{16\pi^2} M^2,$$  
with $g$ a dimensionless coupling. Assuming the renormalization group evolution of $m_H^2$ between scales $M$ and the electroweak scale $v$ is dominated by Standard Model beta functions and can be approximated as  
$$m_H^2(v) \approx m_H^2(M) - \frac{3 y_t^2}{8 \pi^2} m_H^2(M) \ln\left(\frac{M}{v}\right),$$  
derive an explicit expression for the upper bound on $M$ such that the relative correction to $m_H^2(v)$ does not exceed a fixed fine-tuning parameter $\Delta$, i.e.,  
$$\left|\frac{\delta m_H^2}{m_H^2(v)}\right| \leq \Delta.$$  
Express $M$ in terms of $g, y_t, v, m_H$, and $\Delta$.

</question>

<question>  
In a Wilsonian effective approach, the Higgs field self-energy correction due to a heavy scalar $S$ of mass $M_S$ coupled via interaction term  
$$\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{int}} = -\lambda_{HS} |H|^2 S^2,$$  
where $H$ is the Higgs doublet, induces a correction to the Higgs mass parameter  
$$\delta m_H^2 = \frac{\lambda_{HS}}{16\pi^2} \Lambda^2 \Big(1 - \frac{M_S^2}{\Lambda^2} \ln\frac{\Lambda^2 + M_S^2}{M_S^2}\Big).$$  
Derive the limiting form of $\delta m_H^2$ for $\Lambda \gg M_S$ and for $\Lambda \to M_S$ and provide a closed-form symbolic expression for $\delta m_H^2$ in each limit.

</question>

<question>  
The Higgs vacuum expectation value (VEV) $v$ is determined by minimizing the Higgs potential with tree-level mass parameter $\mu_h^2$ and quartic coupling $\lambda$:  
$$V(H) = -\mu_h^2 |H|^2 + \lambda |H|^4.$$  
Given the physical Higgs mass $m_h$ satisfies  
$$m_h^2 = 2 \lambda v^2,$$  
and allowing for threshold corrections $\Delta \mu_h^2$ from heavy states at scale $M \gg v$ such that  
$$\mu_h^2 = \mu_0^2 + \Delta \mu_h^2,$$  
with  
$$\Delta \mu_h^2 = \frac{C}{16\pi^2} M^2,$$  
where $C$ is a dimensionless constant, express the sensitivity measure  
$$S = \left| \frac{\partial \ln v^2}{\partial \ln M^2} \right|$$  
in terms of $C, \mu_0^2, M^2,$ and $v^2$. Provide an explicit symbolic formula for $S$ assuming $\mu_0^2$ is tuned to reproduce the physical $v^2$.

> </question>

#### **Evaluation & Feedback**

- **+** Good modeling—realistic Higgs fine-tuning scenario.
- **+** Targets a single symbolic expression ($\Delta$).
- **+** Requires multi-step reasoning (manipulation of the expressions and possible substitution).
- **-** The last instruction: "and discuss its dependence..." violates Guideline 11 (should not request a discussion but only a symbolic formula).
- **-** The question is clear, concise, and avoids unnecessary background.
- **+** Markdown LaTeX is correct and all math is properly formatted.
- **+** No extraneous variables, and the answer is unique.
- **-** The reference to "$m_0^2$ is adjusted..." could be more concrete: it's better to state the relationship/formula for $m_0^2$ to avoid ambiguity.

#### **How to Improve**
- Remove the request for a discussion; request only the symbolic expression.
- Specify the exact requirement for $m_0^2$ ("assuming $m_0^2 = m_H^2(\mu) - \frac{\kappa}{16\pi^2} \Lambda^2$" or equivalent), so there is zero ambiguity.

#### **Evaluation & Feedback**

- **+** Modeled from effective field theory Higgs potential: realistic, advanced, not textbook.
- **+** Clear target: symbolic equation for $v$.
- **+** The multi-step reasoning is required: take derivative, set to zero, solve for $v$.
- **+** Variables are all relevant, no redundancy.
- **+** LaTeX formatting is correct; question well-phrased and concise.
- **-** The phrase "implicitly or explicitly" is ambiguous; prefer to require an explicit symbolic condition or the most explicit form possible, leaving no ambiguity about what is expected.
- **-** The phrase "find the condition on $h = v$ that satisfies..." is convoluted; better to say "derive a symbolic equation for $v$...".

#### **How to Improve**
- Unambiguously require an explicit symbolic equation for $v$ (even if only implicit).
- Rephrase to be direct and concise, removing unnecessary words.

#### **Evaluation & Feedback**

- **+** Models a physical BSM scenario.
- **+** Targets a symbolic equation for the upper bound on $M$ in terms of specified variables.
- **+** Requires multi-step reasoning (threshold correction, RG running, algebraic manipulation).
- **-** The correction $m_H^2(v) \approx m_H^2(M) - \ldots$ produces a dependence on $m_H^2(M)$, which may not be uniquely determined in terms of $m_H$ (physical mass at $v$), possibly leading to ambiguity in the solution.
- **+** Variables are all relevant and not redundant.
- **+** LaTeX is correct.
- **-** "Derive an explicit expression..."—clarify exactly which $m_H$ (is it $m_H(v)$, physical mass?) and that all quantities requested are symbolic.
- **-** Problem could admit more than one rearrangement if $m_H^2(v)$ is not strictly determined; better to state that $m_H(v)$ is the physical pole mass or make $m_H^2(v)$ explicit.

#### **How to Improve**
- State explicitly that $m_H(v)$ is the physical Higgs mass, and that $m_H^2(v)$ should be used to express the bound.
- Require a symbolic formula for the maximal $M$ in terms of $g, y_t, v, m_H, \Delta$.

#### **Evaluation & Feedback**

- **+** Specific, nonstandard quantum field theory scenario.
- **-** Asks for "the limiting form...for $\Lambda \gg M_S$ and for $\Lambda \to M_S$ and provide closed-form...in each limit." This constitutes a two-part question, conflicting with Guideline 11.
- **+** Multi-step: requires expansions and limiting algebra.
- **-** Expects two answers (one per limiting case), violating the requirement of a single solution.
- **+** LaTeX and markdown are correct.
- **+** All variables/quantities are relevant, no redundancy.
- **-** Could be reframed to focus on one limit to satisfy guidelines.

#### **How to Improve**
- Ask for the symbolic limiting form in only one limit to guarantee a single answer; or request a symbolic formula for a given hierarchy of scales.
- If necessary, split into two separate questions.

with $\kappa > 0$. If the bare mass parameter $m_0^2$ is chosen such that the physical Higgs mass squared at the electroweak scale $\mu \ll \Lambda$ is fixed to $m_H^2(\mu)$, derive a symbolic expression for the fine-tuning measure

A new physics threshold at scale $M \gg v$ induces a correction to the Higgs mass parameter  
$$\delta m_H^2 = \frac{g^2}{16\pi^2} M^2,$$

$$m_H^2(v) \approx m_H^2(M) - \frac{3 y_t^2}{8 \pi^2} m_H^2(M) \ln\left(\frac{M}{v}\right),$$

=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Certainly! Here is a critique for each question, evaluated point-by-point, followed by general syntactic feedback and specific suggestions for improvement.

---

### Question 1

**Strengths:**
- Clearly models a physical scenario (Wilsonian EFT for SM Higgs).
- The problem targets a specific, physically motivated solvable quantity (fine-tuning measure).
- Correctly uses LaTeX and Markdown formatting and is enclosed within <question> tags.
- Requires multi-step reasoning (relating cutoff effects to fine-tuning).
- Variables used are relevant.
- Expects a unique symbolic expression, not multiple answers.
- Wording is concise and not colloquial.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- $m_H^2(\Lambda)$ and $m_H^2(\mu)$ are both "mass squared" at different scales, which could confuse if the distinction isn’t explicit. A note that $m_H^2(\mu)$ is fixed by experiment could help, but it’s not strictly necessary.
- The phrase "chosen such that..." could be more direct: perhaps "Given that $m_0^2$ is chosen to fix..."
- Units and notation for mass squared are standard.

**Summary:**  
Meets requirements. Marginal improvement: "Given that $m_0^2$ is fixed such that..." improves clarity.

---

### Question 2

**Strengths:**
- Well-posed, rooted in a realistic scenario (quantum corrections to Higgs potential).
- Targets a single, unique equation: condition for minimum.
- Requires multistep calculus (take derivative, set to zero).
- Uses LaTeX/Markdown, variables are standard, question is concise.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Specifies to "derive a symbolic equation"—could clarify that the user should "write an explicit equation satisfied by $v$ that minimizes $V_{\mathrm{eff}}$," which aids in interpretation.
- All variables used are necessary, nothing superfluous.

**Summary:**  
Strong question. Consider minor clarifications ("write an explicit equation satisfied by $v$") for transparency.

---

### Question 3

**Strengths:**
- Models new physics threshold and RG running effect (well-posed scenario).
- Solvable symbolic upper bound targeted, asks for explicit result for $M$.
- Requires several steps: apply correction, solve inequality.
- Well-formatted in Markdown/LaTeX.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The phrase "explicit symbolic upper bound" is good, but could more directly say: "Express $M$ as a function of..." for maximum clarity.
- The variable $m_H$ is used with implicit meaning as the mass at scale $v$; ensure this is unambiguous (e.g., clarify "$m_H$ is the physical Higgs mass at scale $v$").
- Avoid use of "physical Higgs mass squared" and "$m_H$" in the same question without explicit setting; perhaps substitute one or clarify.

**Summary:**  
Minor clarity suggestions on variable definitions; otherwise meets rubric.

---

### Question 4

**Strengths:**
- Effective scenario (threshold effects; heavy scalar corrections to Higgs mass).
- Clear task: derive limiting form.
- All variables are necessary.
- Requires physics and mathematical limit-taking.
- Solution is unique, unambiguous, LaTeX is correct.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Make it explicit that only $\Lambda \gg M_S$ limit is relevant; possibly add "to leading order in $M_S^2/\Lambda^2$".
- Remove unneeded phrase "closed-form" (since it's a standard limiting expansion).
- Could ask to “Simplify $\delta m_H^2$ to leading order in $M_S^2/\Lambda^2$…”.

**Summary:**  
Strong. Minor adjustment in phrasing, specify expansion variable.

---

### Question 5

**Strengths:**
- Scenario is realistic (Higgs VEV shift from heavy threshold).
- Solvable symbolic sensitivity expression is well-defined.
- Multi-step: relate mass parameter, VEV, sensitivity via calculus.
- All variables necessary.
- LaTeX/Markdown correct, concise tone.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Variable overlap: $v, \mu_0^2$ may need explicit association to maintain clarity.
- Could specify that $v$ is the tree-level minimum of the potential given the mass parameter.
- Reword "Assuming $\mu_0^2$ is chosen such that..." to "Given that $\mu_0^2$ is fixed such that…", for directness.

**Summary:**  
Clear question, only minor refinement to phrasing needed.

- For absolute clarity, introduce a brief definition for any non-standard symbols (especially if $m_H$, $m_H^2$, and $v$ are all used in one question).
- Refine "chosen such that" → "fixed so that" (for directness and active phrasing).
- Avoid phrases like "closed-form" unless specifically necessary; prefer "explicitly in terms of..." or "in the limit of..."
- For limit processes, add “to leading order in $M_S^2/\Lambda^2$” to specify the expansion.
- Where possible, say "derive", "express $X$ as a function of $Y$," or "write an explicit equation for $Z$" for maximal directness.

## **Final Summary (Sample Formulaic Example for Feedback)**

> **Your questions meet nearly all rubric criteria: realistic scenario, single unique answer, rigorous standard notation, and multistep reasoning. Primary improvements: clarify any double usage of mass symbols ($m_H^2$ and $m_H$), directly state which variables are required as input/output, and use unambiguous, active phrasing. In limit-derivation exercises, specify terms to be neglected/retained. LaTeX syntax and tags are correct.**

<question>
Consider a scalar field \(\phi\) in the Standard Model with a Wilsonian effective Lagrangian valid up to cutoff scale \(\Lambda\), where quantum corrections induce a mass term  
\[
m_H^2(\Lambda) = m_0^2 + \frac{\kappa}{16\pi^2} \Lambda^2,
\]  
with \(\kappa > 0\). Given that the bare mass parameter \(m_0^2\) is fixed so that the physical Higgs mass squared at the electroweak scale \(\mu \ll \Lambda\) is \(m_H^2(\mu)\), derive a symbolic expression for the fine-tuning measure  
\[
\Delta = \left| \frac{m_H^2(\Lambda) - m_H^2(\mu)}{m_H^2(\mu)} \right|
\]  
in terms of \(\Lambda\), \(\kappa\), and \(m_H(\mu)\).
</question>

<question>
For the one-loop effective Higgs potential at renormalization scale \(\mu\):  
\[
V_{\mathrm{eff}}(h) = -\frac{1}{2} m^2(\mu) h^2 + \frac{\lambda(\mu)}{4} h^4 + \frac{3}{64\pi^2} y_t^4 h^4 \ln \left( \frac{y_t^2 h^2}{\mu^2} \right),
\]  
where \(h\) is the real Higgs field, \(y_t\) the top Yukawa coupling, and \(m^2(\mu), \lambda(\mu)\) are running parameters, write an explicit equation satisfied by the vacuum expectation value \(v\) that minimizes \(V_{\mathrm{eff}}(h)\). Express the equation in terms of \(v\), \(m^2(\mu)\), \(\lambda(\mu)\), \(y_t\), and \(\mu\).
</question>

<question>
A new physics threshold at scale \(M \gg v\) induces a correction to the Higgs mass parameter  
\[
\delta m_H^2 = \frac{g^2}{16\pi^2} M^2,
\]  
with \(g\) a dimensionless coupling. Between scales \(M\) and the electroweak scale \(v\), the Higgs mass squared evolves approximately as  
\[
m_H^2(v) \approx m_H^2(M) - \frac{3 y_t^2}{8 \pi^2} m_H^2(M) \ln\left(\frac{M}{v}\right),
\]  
where \(m_H^2(v)\) is the physical Higgs mass squared at scale \(v\). Assuming the relative correction satisfies  
\[
\left| \frac{\delta m_H^2}{m_H^2(v)} \right| \leq \Delta,
\]  
derive an explicit symbolic upper bound for \(M\) expressed in terms of \(g\), \(y_t\), \(v\), the physical Higgs mass \(m_H\) at scale \(v\), and \(\Delta\).
</question>

<question>
In a Wilsonian effective framework, a heavy scalar field \(S\) of mass \(M_S\) coupled to the Higgs doublet \(H\) via  
\[
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{int}} = -\lambda_{HS} |H|^2 S^2,
\]  
induces a correction to the Higgs mass parameter given by  
\[
\delta m_H^2 = \frac{\lambda_{HS}}{16\pi^2} \Lambda^2 \left(1 - \frac{M_S^2}{\Lambda^2} \ln\frac{\Lambda^2 + M_S^2}{M_S^2}\right).
\]  
Derive the simplified expression for \(\delta m_H^2\) in the limit \(\Lambda \gg M_S\), keeping terms to leading order in the small parameter \(M_S^2/\Lambda^2\). Express your answer symbolically in terms of \(\lambda_{HS}\), \(\Lambda\), and \(M_S\).
</question>

<question>
The Higgs vacuum expectation value \(v\) minimizes the tree-level potential  
\[
V(H) = -\mu_h^2 |H|^2 + \lambda |H|^4,
\]  
with the physical Higgs mass related to \(v\) as  
\[
m_h^2 = 2 \lambda v^2,
\]  
and the mass parameter corrected by threshold effects from heavy states at scale \(M \gg v\) as  
\[
\mu_h^2 = \mu_0^2 + \frac{C}{16\pi^2} M^2,
\]  
where \(C\) is dimensionless. Given that \(\mu_0^2\) is fixed so the physical \(v\) is reproduced, derive a symbolic expression for the sensitivity measure  
\[
S = \left| \frac{\partial \ln v^2}{\partial \ln M^2} \right|,
\]  
expressed in terms of \(C\), \(\mu_0^2\), \(M^2\), and \(v^2\).
