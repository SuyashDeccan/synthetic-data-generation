A Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) experiment is set up with $N = 10$ modes. The squeezing parameter for each mode is set to $r = 1.0$. An ideal GBS device would produce a photon number distribution $P(n)$ where $n$ is the total number of photons detected across all modes. However, due to detector inefficiencies, only a fraction $\eta = 0.9$ of the photons are detected. Assuming that the detector inefficiency affects each photon independently, calculate the expected mean number of detected photons, $\langle n_{detected} \rangle$. Assume that the thermal photon number $\mu = sinh^2(r)$. The mean number of photons in a squeezed state is $N \mu$.

Consider a quantum information processing scheme using time-bin encoding. A qubit is encoded into two temporal modes, an "early" mode $|0\rangle$ and a "late" mode $|1\rangle$, separated by a time interval $\Delta t = 10 \, \mathrm{ns}$. An experimental setup aims to implement a Hadamard gate on this time-bin qubit. The Hadamard gate operation is implemented using a beam splitter with adjustable reflectivity and a relative phase shift. Due to imperfections in the setup, the implemented gate has a fidelity of $F = 0.95$ with respect to the ideal Hadamard gate. If the input state is the superposition state $|\psi_{in}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)$, what is the probability of measuring the output state in the state $|\psi_{out}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle)$ given the gate fidelity $F$? Assume that the probability of obtaining the desired output state scales linearly with the fidelity: $P(|\psi_{out}\rangle) = F \cdot P_{ideal}(|\psi_{out}\rangle) + (1 - F) \cdot P_{error}(|\psi_{out}\rangle)$, where $P_{ideal}$ is the ideal probability and $P_{error}$ is 0.

An experiment implements a universal linear transformation on time-frequency modes using a series of electro-optic modulators. The desired transformation is a beamsplitter operation between two frequency modes, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, with a reflectivity $R = 0.6$ and transmissivity $T = 0.4$. The input state is a single photon in mode $\omega_1$, represented as $|\psi_{in}\rangle = a_{\omega_1}^\dagger |0\rangle$, where $a_{\omega_1}^\dagger$ is the creation operator for a photon in mode $\omega_1$. After the beamsplitter transformation, the output state is given by $|\psi_{out}\rangle = \sqrt{T} a_{\omega_1}^\dagger |0\rangle + i\sqrt{R} a_{\omega_2}^\dagger |0\rangle$. However, due to experimental imperfections, the actual reflectivity is $R' = 0.65$. What is the probability of detecting a photon in mode $\omega_2$ after the non-ideal beamsplitter operation?

A GBS experiment is performed to sample from the vibrational modes of a molecule. The experiment aims to generate $M=4$ squeezed states, each with a squeezing parameter of $r=0.8$, and interfere them on a beamsplitter network. Due to losses in the optical setup, the overall transmissivity of the system is $\tau = 0.85$. The molecule exhibits $N=2$ vibrational modes. Assuming that the total number of photons detected is proportional to the number of squeezed states and the transmissivity, what is the expected number of photons detected, $\langle n \rangle$? Each squeezed state has an average photon number of $\sinh^2(r)$. Assume that the molecule couples to a number of modes equal to half the photons detected. What number of molecule modes does it couple to?

<question>
In a time-frequency encoding scheme, a qubit is represented by the superposition of two distinct frequency modes, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, separated by a frequency difference $\Delta \omega = 2\pi \cdot 10 \, \mathrm{GHz}$. These frequency modes are generated using acousto-optic modulators (AOMs). An experimental setup aims to perform a phase-shifting operation on the qubit, described by the unitary transformation $U = e^{i\phi \sigma_z}$, where $\sigma_z$ is the Pauli-Z matrix. The phase shift $\phi$ is implemented by controlling the relative phase of the radio-frequency (RF) signals driving the AOMs. If the desired phase shift is $\phi = \pi/4$, but the actual phase shift achieved is $\phi' = \pi/4 + 0.05\pi$ due to calibration errors, what is the fidelity $F$ of the implemented phase gate? The fidelity is defined as $F = | \langle \psi' | \psi \rangle |^2$, where $|\psi\rangle$ is the ideal output state and $|\psi'\rangle$ is the actual output state. Let the initial state be $|\psi_{in}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\omega_1\rangle + |\omega_2\rangle)$.

Here's a critique of each question against your guidelines, along with concise, actionable feedback for improvement.

**Question 1 Critique:**

**Overall Assessment:** Good. The question sets up a relevant physics scenario and requires multi-step reasoning.

*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** Achieved. It describes a Gaussian Boson Sampling experiment with realistic imperfections (detector inefficiency).
*   **2. Expect answers as either a symbolic expression or a single numerical value with appropriate SI units:** Achieved. It asks for a single numerical value ($\langle n_{detected} \rangle$).
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Achieved. Requires calculating $\mu$, then the total ideal photon number, then applying efficiency.
*   **4. Be Unique:** Achieved. GBS is a specific modern quantum optics context.
*   **5. Single Solution:** Achieved. There is a single correct numerical answer.
*   **6. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** Achieved. The language is clear and professional.
*   **7. All assumptions must be clearly stated, and all variables must be defined for each question separately:** Mostly achieved. All variables are defined. The statement "The mean number of photons in a squeezed state is $N \mu$" is slightly ambiguous; it should clarify that $N \mu$ refers to the *total* mean photons across all $N$ modes *before* detection.
*   **8. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional physics notation:** Achieved. Units are consistent (unitless photon counts). Symbols are conventional.
*   **9. Questions must not be multipart:** Achieved. It asks for a single quantity.
*   **10. Question Formatting:** Achieved. LaTeX with Markdown syntax is used correctly.

**Actionable Feedback:**
Clarify the statement "The mean number of photons in a squeezed state is $N \mu$." to explicitly state that $N \mu$ represents the *total* mean number of photons across all $N$ modes. For example: "The total mean number of photons generated across all $N$ modes is $N \mu$."

---

**Question 2 Critique:**

**Overall Assessment:** Good, but the explicit definition of probability based on fidelity simplifies the quantum mechanical reasoning.

*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** Achieved. It describes a time-bin encoding scheme with a Hadamard gate and fidelity.
*   **2. Expect answers as either a symbolic expression or a single numerical value with appropriate SI units:** Achieved. It asks for a single numerical probability.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Achieved. Requires determining ideal output, calculating ideal probability, and then applying the given fidelity formula.
*   **4. Be Unique:** Achieved. The specific encoding and fidelity application make it reasonably unique.
*   **5. Single Solution:** Achieved. Given the explicit formula, there is a single correct numerical answer.
*   **6. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** Achieved. The language is clear and professional.
*   **7. All assumptions must be clearly stated, and all variables must be defined for each question separately:** Achieved. All variables and states are defined. The specific assumption about how probability scales with fidelity is clearly stated.
*   **8. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional physics notation:** Achieved. Units are consistent, and symbols are conventional.
*   **9. Questions must not be multipart:** Achieved. It asks for a single quantity.
*   **10. Question Formatting:** Achieved. LaTeX with Markdown syntax is used correctly.

**Actionable Feedback:**
The provided formula $P(|\psi_{out}\rangle) = F \cdot P_{ideal}(|\psi_{out}\rangle) + (1 - F) \cdot P_{error}(|\psi_{out}\rangle)$ with $P_{error}=0$ is a very specific and simplified model of how fidelity affects measurement probability. While it fits the multi-step criteria, it bypasses the need for deeper quantum mechanics understanding of how fidelity is typically calculated from states or operators and how imperfections manifest in outcomes. Consider replacing this explicit formula with a more standard definition of fidelity (e.g., state fidelity $F = |\langle \psi_{ideal} | \psi_{actual} \rangle|^2$) and requiring the student to deduce the probability based on an implicitly or explicitly defined imperfect output state or error channel. This would enhance the "conceptual understanding and physical reasoning" aspect.

---

**Question 3 Critique:**

**Overall Assessment:** Weak. Fails to meet the "Force Multi-Step Reasoning" guideline.

*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** Achieved. It describes a beamsplitter operation on frequency modes with imperfections.
*   **2. Expect answers as either a symbolic expression or a single numerical value with appropriate SI units:** Achieved. It asks for a single numerical probability.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** **Failed.** The question explicitly provides the output state formula, $|\psi_{out}\rangle = \sqrt{T} a_{\omega_1}^\dagger |0\rangle + i\sqrt{R} a_{\omega_2}^\dagger |0\rangle$. Calculating the probability of detecting a photon in mode $\omega_2$ with an actual reflectivity $R'$ is a direct, single-step substitution ($P = R'$). This does not involve two or more distinct physical principles or complex logical steps beyond identifying the coefficient in the given state. The initial $R=0.6$ and $T=0.4$ are almost entirely irrelevant to the actual calculation.
*   **4. Be Unique:** Partially achieved. While the context is specific, the core calculation is a very common type of problem.
*   **5. Single Solution:** Achieved. There is a single correct numerical answer.
*   **6. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** Achieved. The language is clear and professional.
*   **7. All assumptions must be clearly stated, and all variables must be defined for each question separately:** Achieved. Variables are defined, and the form of the output state is given.
*   **8. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional physics notation:** Achieved. Units are consistent, and symbols are conventional.
*   **9. Questions must not be multipart:** Achieved. It asks for a single quantity.
*   **10. Question Formatting:** Achieved. LaTeX with Markdown syntax is used correctly.

**Actionable Feedback:**
To meet the "Force Multi-Step Reasoning" guideline, do not provide the output state explicitly. Instead, describe the beamsplitter operation and the input state, and require the student to derive the output state and subsequently the probability of detection using the actual reflectivity $R'$ and transmissivity $T'$ (implying $T' = 1-R'$). Alternatively, add a subsequent physical step, such as a loss, an additional gate, or a measurement with efficiency.

---

**Question 4 Critique:**

**Overall Assessment:** Poor. Fails "Not Multipart" and includes an arbitrary, unphysical calculation.

*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** Partially achieved. While GBS is a physical scenario, the second part of the question (molecule coupling) is unphysical as phrased.
*   **2. Expect answers as either a symbolic expression or a single numerical value with appropriate SI units:** Achieved for each part individually, but the question is multipart.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Achieved for the first part (calculating $\langle n \rangle$). The second part is an arbitrary calculation based on a given rule, not a physical reasoning step.
*   **4. Be Unique:** Partially achieved. The GBS context is unique, but the arbitrary second part detracts from uniqueness in a positive sense.
*   **5. Single Solution:** Achieved for each part individually.
*   **6. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** **Failed.** The phrasing "Assuming that the total number of photons detected is proportional to the number of squeezed states and the transmissivity" is vague and could be stated more clearly as multiplication. The second part "Assume that the molecule couples to a number of modes equal to half the photons detected. What number of molecule modes does it couple to?" is a completely arbitrary rule, not a physical assumption, and makes the problem nonsensical from a physics perspective.
*   **7. All assumptions must be clearly stated, and all variables must be defined for each question separately:** Partially achieved. Variables are defined. The problematic "proportionality" and arbitrary "coupling" are stated as assumptions, but their unphysical nature is a major flaw. The $N=2$ vibrational modes mentioned initially become irrelevant due to the arbitrary rule.
*   **8. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional physics notation:** Achieved. Units are consistent (unitless photon counts). Symbols are conventional.
*   **9. Questions must not be multipart:** **Failed.** The question explicitly asks for two separate quantities: "expected number of photons detected, $\langle n \rangle$" and "What number of molecule modes does it couple to?". This directly violates the guideline.
*   **10. Question Formatting:** Achieved. LaTeX with Markdown syntax is used correctly.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Eliminate Multipart:** Focus on a single target quantity. Remove the second question about "What number of molecule modes does it couple to?".
2.  **Remove Arbitrary Rule:** The statement "Assume that the molecule couples to a number of modes equal to half the photons detected" is unphysical and adds confusion. Remove it.
3.  **Clarify Phrasing:** Rephrase "Assuming that the total number of photons detected is proportional to the number of squeezed states and the transmissivity" to be more precise, e.g., "The total mean number of photons generated is $M \cdot \sinh^2(r)$, and the expected number of detected photons is this value multiplied by the system's overall transmissivity $\tau$."
4.  **Remove Irrelevant Information:** The initial mention of $N=2$ vibrational modes is currently irrelevant to the calculation and should be removed unless it's integrated into a revised, single-part question.

---

**Question 5 Critique:**

**Overall Assessment:** Excellent. Meets all guidelines effectively.

*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** Achieved. It describes a time-frequency encoding scheme with a phase gate, AOMs, and calibration errors leading to fidelity reduction.
*   **2. Expect answers as either a symbolic expression or a single numerical value with appropriate SI units:** Achieved. It asks for a single numerical fidelity value.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Achieved. Requires applying the ideal gate, applying the actual gate, calculating the inner product of the resulting states, and finally squaring the magnitude for fidelity.
*   **4. Be Unique:** Achieved. The specific encoding, AOM context, and error type make it a novel and conceptually rich scenario.
*   **5. Single Solution:** Achieved. There is a single correct numerical answer.
*   **6. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** Achieved. The language is clear and professional.
*   **7. All assumptions must be clearly stated, and all variables must be defined for each question separately:** Achieved. All variables, states, and the fidelity definition are clearly stated.
*   **8. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional physics notation:** Achieved. Units are consistent, and symbols are conventional. The $\Delta \omega$ is contextual information, not used in calculation, which is fine.
*   **9. Questions must not be multipart:** Achieved. It asks for a single quantity.
*   **10. Question Formatting:** Achieved. LaTeX with Markdown syntax is used correctly.

**Actionable Feedback:**

*   **Minor Improvement (Guideline 7):** The phrase "thermal photon number $\mu = \sinh^2(r)$" is slightly unconventional in the context of pure squeezed states in GBS. While $\sinh^2(r)$ is indeed the mean photon number of a single-mode squeezed vacuum state, referring to it as "thermal" might be misleading as GBS typically deals with pure states, not thermal states. It's more accurately described as the *mean photon number per mode due to squeezing*. This is a minor semantic point and does not affect the calculation.

**Critique:**

*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** Yes, time-bin encoding and Hadamard gate are relevant.
*   **2. Expect answers as symbolic or numerical:** Expects a single numerical value.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Requires applying ideal gate, constructing actual state, and calculating probability. (3 steps) - Satisfied.

*   **10. Question Formatting:** Correct.

**Actionable Feedback:**

*   **Major Improvement (Guideline 7 & 4):** The model for the "actual output state" ($|\psi_{actual}\rangle = \sqrt{F}|\psi_{ideal}\rangle + \sqrt{1-F}|\epsilon\rangle$) is highly specific and somewhat artificial. While it ensures a solvable problem with pure states and a well-defined fidelity, it doesn't represent a general "error channel" in quantum information, which typically involves density matrices and CPTP maps. This formulation essentially *gives* the student the relationship between fidelity and the specific output state, rather than having them deduce how fidelity (as typically defined for gate performance) would manifest in a specific error scenario. It reduces the reasoning complexity related to fidelity itself.
    *   **Suggestion:** Consider if a more standard fidelity calculation (e.g., between two density matrices) or a simpler pure-state error (e.g., miscalibration leading to a slightly different unitary) could be used. If keeping this specific model, acknowledge its simplification or frame it as a specific *type* of error rather than a general "error channel characterized by a fidelity." The current phrasing might imply a deeper understanding of fidelity (and inverse problem solving) that isn't truly tested by the given formula.

**Actionable Feedback:**

*   **Minor Improvement (Guideline 8):** The problem implicitly assumes that despite the "imperfections" changing the reflectivity to $R'$, the beamsplitter remains *lossless*, meaning the new transmissivity $T'$ is simply $1-R'$. This is the standard assumption for beamsplitter problems unless loss is explicitly mentioned. However, to eliminate any ambiguity for an advanced learner who might consider lossy beamsplitters ($R' + T' < 1$), it would be beneficial to explicitly state: "Assume the beamsplitter remains lossless such that $T' + R' = 1$."

A GBS experiment is performed to sample from the vibrational modes of a molecule. The experiment aims to generate $M=4$ squeezed states, each with a squeezing parameter of $r=0.8$, and interfere them on a beamsplitter network.

Each squeezed state has an average photon number of $\sinh^2(r)$. The expected number of detected photons is the total mean number of photons generated multiplied by the system's overall transmissivity $\tau$.

**Actionable Feedback:**

*   **Major Improvement (Guideline 4):** The last sentence, "The expected number of detected photons is the total mean number of photons generated multiplied by the system's overall transmissivity $\tau$," explicitly provides the final step of the calculation. This significantly reduces the multi-step reasoning required, effectively turning a 3-step problem into a 2-step one by giving away the relationship between generated photons and detected photons under loss.
    *   **Suggestion:** Remove the last sentence. The connection between overall transmissivity and the expected number of detected photons is a fundamental concept students should be able to infer. The question would then truly require the student to perform all three conceptual steps.

A Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) experiment is set up with $N = 10$ modes. The squeezing parameter for each mode is set to $r = 1.0$. An ideal GBS device would produce a photon number distribution $P(n)$ where $n$ is the total number of photons detected across all modes. However, due to detector inefficiencies, only a fraction $\eta = 0.9$ of the photons are detected. Assuming that the detector inefficiency affects each photon independently, calculate the expected mean number of detected photons, $\langle n_{detected} \rangle$. Let $\mu = \sinh^2(r)$ be the mean photon number per mode due to squeezing. The total mean number of photons generated across all $N$ modes is $N \mu$.

Consider a quantum information processing scheme using time-bin encoding. A qubit is encoded into two temporal modes, an "early" mode $|0\rangle$ and a "late" mode $|1\rangle$, separated by a time interval $\Delta t = 10 \, \mathrm{ns}$. An experimental setup aims to implement a Hadamard gate on this time-bin qubit. The Hadamard gate operation is implemented using a beam splitter with adjustable reflectivity and a relative phase shift. Due to imperfections in the setup, the implemented gate transforms the input state such that the actual output state can be approximated as $|\psi_{actual}\rangle = \sqrt{F}|\psi_{ideal}\rangle + \sqrt{1-F}|\epsilon\rangle$, where $F = 0.95$ is a fidelity parameter, $|\psi_{ideal}\rangle$ is the state after an ideal Hadamard gate, and $|\epsilon\rangle = |1\rangle$. This simplified model captures the effect of a specific type of error. If the input state is the superposition state $|\psi_{in}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)$, what is the probability of measuring the output state in the state $|\psi_{out}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle)$?

An experiment implements a universal linear transformation on time-frequency modes using a series of electro-optic modulators. The desired transformation is a beamsplitter operation between two frequency modes, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$. The input state is a single photon in mode $\omega_1$, represented as $|\psi_{in}\rangle = a_{\omega_1}^\dagger |0\rangle$, where $a_{\omega_1}^\dagger$ is the creation operator for a photon in mode $\omega_1$. After the beamsplitter transformation, the output state should ideally be given by $|\psi_{out}\rangle = \sqrt{T} a_{\omega_1}^\dagger |0\rangle + i\sqrt{R} a_{\omega_2}^\dagger |0\rangle$, where $R$ is the reflectivity and $T$ is the transmissivity of the beamsplitter. However, due to experimental imperfections, the actual reflectivity is $R' = 0.65$. Assume the beamsplitter remains lossless such that $T' + R' = 1$. What is the probability of detecting a photon in mode $\omega_2$ after the non-ideal beamsplitter operation?

A GBS experiment is performed to sample from the vibrational modes of a molecule. The experiment aims to generate $M=4$ squeezed states, each with a squeezing parameter of $r=0.8$, and interfere them on a beamsplitter network. Due to losses in the optical setup, the overall transmissivity of the system is $\tau = 0.85$. What is the expected number of photons detected, $\langle n \rangle$? Each squeezed state has an average photon number of $\sinh^2(r)$.

In a time-frequency encoding scheme, a qubit is represented by the superposition of two distinct frequency modes, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, separated by a frequency difference $\Delta \omega = 2\pi \cdot 10 \, \mathrm{GHz}$. These frequency modes are generated using acousto-optic modulators (AOMs). An experimental setup aims to perform a phase-shifting operation on the qubit, described by the unitary transformation $U = e^{i\phi \sigma_z}$, where $\sigma_z$ is the Pauli-Z matrix. The phase shift $\phi$ is implemented by controlling the relative phase of the radio-frequency (RF) signals driving the AOMs. If the desired phase shift is $\phi = \pi/4$, but the actual phase shift achieved is $\phi' = \pi/4 + 0.05\pi$ due to calibration errors, what is the fidelity $F$ of the implemented phase gate? The fidelity is defined as $F = | \langle \psi' | \psi \rangle |^2$, where $|\psi\rangle$ is the ideal output state and $|\psi'\rangle$ is the actual output state. Let the initial state be $|\psi_{in}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\omega_1\rangle + |\omega_2\rangle)$.
