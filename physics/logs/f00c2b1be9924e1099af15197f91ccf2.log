<question>
A beam of unpolarized light with intensity $I_0$ is incident on a stack of two polarizers. The first polarizer has its transmission axis oriented at an angle of $30^\circ$ relative to the vertical, and the second polarizer has its transmission axis oriented at an angle of $60^\circ$ relative to the vertical. What is the intensity of the light transmitted through the second polarizer, expressed as a fraction of $I_0$?
</question>

**Critique:**
This question is well-phrased, requires multi-step reasoning (Malus's Law for unpolarized light, then Malus's Law for polarized light with relative angle calculation), and uses correct formatting. However, it is a highly conventional textbook problem for polarizers, which violates Guideline 4 ("Be Unique").

**Actionable Feedback:**
To improve, create a novel scenario that still requires understanding Malus's Law but in a less predictable context, or integrate it with another concept (e.g., polarization by reflection/Brewster's angle, or applications like LCD displays) to make it more unique and conceptually rich.

<question>
A radar emits electromagnetic waves with a frequency of $10 \, \mathrm{GHz}$ toward an approaching airplane. The frequency of the reflected wave, as measured by the radar, is $10.001 \, \mathrm{GHz}$. Assuming the airplane is moving directly towards the radar, what is the airplane's speed in $\mathrm{m/s}$? (Use the speed of light $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \mathrm{m/s}$.)
</question>

**Critique:**
The question is clear, tests the Doppler effect, and requires multi-step reasoning (calculating frequency shift, then applying the double Doppler shift formula for reflection). It adheres to formatting and unit guidelines. However, this is a very standard Doppler radar problem commonly found in textbooks, violating Guideline 4 ("Be Unique").

**Actionable Feedback:**
To enhance uniqueness, consider a scenario with a non-zero angle between the radar beam and the airplane's velocity vector, requiring vector decomposition. Alternatively, integrate it with another wave phenomenon or ask for a different derived quantity that complicates the direct application of the formula.

<question>
A thin plano-convex lens with a radius of curvature $R = 50 \, \mathrm{cm}$ is used to form an image of an object placed $u = 2 \, \mathrm{m}$ away from the lens. The lens has a refractive index $n = 1.5$. What is the distance $v$, in meters, of the image from the lens?
</question>

**Critique:**
This question effectively tests multi-step reasoning by combining the lens maker's formula with the thin lens formula. It follows formatting and unit guidelines. However, it is a very common problem that directly applies these two fundamental formulas in sequence, which violates Guideline 4 ("Be Unique").

**Actionable Feedback:**
To improve uniqueness, consider a scenario with a system of multiple lenses, or a lens immersed in a different medium, or perhaps a combination of a lens and a mirror. Or, ask about the magnification or nature of the image in a more complex setup that requires deeper conceptual understanding beyond just formulaic application.

<question>
Monochromatic light with a wavelength of $\lambda = 400 \, \mathrm{nm}$ is incident on a metal surface with a work function of $\phi = 2.0 \, \mathrm{eV}$. What is the maximum kinetic energy, in electron volts ($\mathrm{eV}$), of the emitted photoelectrons? (Use $h = 4.135 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{eV \cdot s}$ and $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \mathrm{m/s}$.)
</question>

**Critique:**
This question is clear, requires multi-step reasoning (photon energy calculation, then photoelectric equation), and adheres to all formatting and unit guidelines. However, it is the most common and fundamental textbook problem for the photoelectric effect, violating Guideline 4 ("Be Unique").

**Actionable Feedback:**
To improve, consider asking for the stopping voltage, or changing the wavelength and asking about the work function, or combining it with concepts of particle momentum or de Broglie wavelength. A scenario involving an unknown metal or a graph analysis would also increase uniqueness and conceptual depth.

<question>
A monochromatic X-ray beam with a wavelength of $\lambda = 0.1 \, \mathrm{nm}$ is incident on a carbon target. Calculate the wavelength, $\lambda'$, in nm, of the X-rays scattered at an angle of $\theta = 90^\circ$. (Use the Compton wavelength $\lambda_C = 0.00243 \, \mathrm{nm}$.)
</question>

**Critique:**
This question is well-structured, tests the Compton scattering formula, and requires multi-step reasoning (applying the formula and then calculating the scattered wavelength). It follows formatting and unit guidelines. However, the specific angle ($\theta = 90^\circ$) is commonly used in textbooks because it simplifies the formula, making this a very standard problem that violates Guideline 4 ("Be Unique").

**Actionable Feedback:**
To improve, consider asking for the kinetic energy of the recoiling electron, or the energy of the scattered photon. Alternatively, use a different scattering angle where $\cos \theta$ is not zero or one, requiring more general application of the formula. A scenario involving a change in target material or initial photon energy leading to different scattering characteristics could also increase uniqueness.

### Question 1 Critique

```xml
<question>
A student is experimenting with a microwave oven. They place a plate of uniformly distributed, but slightly uneven, wet clay inside and run it for a short time. They observe that the clay dries fastest in a ring with a diameter of 12 cm. Assuming the microwave frequency is 2.45 GHz, what is the effective speed of electromagnetic waves inside the microwave oven in m/s? Explain your reasoning based on standing wave formation.
</question>
```

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Good. A real-world scenario involving standing waves.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Format):** Asks for a single numerical value, but also "Explain your reasoning," which adds a conceptual explanation component beyond a single numerical or symbolic answer.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, it requires interpreting the diameter in terms of wavelength ($\lambda = D$ or $\lambda = D/2$ depending on interpretation, typically $D = \lambda$ for first ring from center if center is antinode, or $D = \lambda$ for distance between antinodes in a linear pattern if "ring" refers to a linear measurement across the oven). Then, calculating speed ($v = f\lambda$). This is multi-step.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** The "wet clay" and "drying fastest in a ring" is a slightly more unique twist than just "hot spots," but the core problem (microwave standing waves) is common.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Ambiguity in the interpretation of "ring with a diameter of 12 cm" (is it $\lambda/2$, $\lambda$, or something else for the distance between antinodes?) could lead to different answers. The most common interpretation for a microwave oven is that the distance between adjacent antinodes is $\lambda/2$. If "ring diameter of 12 cm" refers to the distance *between* two such adjacent hot spots, then $\lambda/2 = 12$ cm. If it refers to the diameter of the *first* antinodal ring from the center (assuming center is an antinode), then the radius $R = \lambda/2$, so diameter $D = \lambda$.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** The phrase "uniformly distributed, but slightly uneven, wet clay" is a bit verbose; "uniformly distributed wet clay" suffices. The "Explain your reasoning" part violates Guideline 10.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units & Notation):** Consistent units, conventional notation.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not Multipart):** **Fails.** Explicitly asks for a numerical value *and* an explanation. This makes it a multipart question.
*   **Guideline 11 (Question Formatting):** Correct.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1.  **Remove "Explain your reasoning":** This violates the "not multipart" guideline. The question should be designed such that reaching the correct numerical answer *requires* the student to perform the correct reasoning, but it should not explicitly ask for the explanation as part of the answer.
2.  **Clarify the measurement:** Be precise about what the 12 cm represents. For instance: "They observe that the distance between adjacent hot spots (antinodes) is 12 cm." Or, "They observe that the first circular antinodal region from the center has a diameter of 12 cm, with the center also being an antinode." (This implies $\lambda = 12$ cm). Clarifying this will ensure a single, unambiguous solution.
3.  **Conciseness:** Simplify "uniformly distributed, but slightly uneven, wet clay" to "uniformly distributed wet clay."

### Question 2 Critique

```xml
<question>
An air traffic controller is using radar with a frequency of 5 GHz to track two airplanes approaching the airport. Airplane A is flying directly towards the radar tower, while Airplane B is approaching at an angle of 30 degrees relative to the line connecting it to the tower. If the controller observes a Doppler shift of 1.2 kHz for Airplane A and 1.1 kHz for Airplane B, what are the speeds of the two airplanes *relative to the airport runway* in m/s? Assume both airplanes are at the same altitude and that the runway points directly towards the radar tower.
</question>
```

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Good. A practical scenario using the Doppler effect.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Format):** Asks for two numerical values.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, it requires applying the Doppler effect formula for each airplane, considering the angle for Airplane B.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Doppler shift problems are common, but involving two airplanes with different angles adds a slight, but not highly unique, variation.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** If it were asking for a single quantity, it would be unique. Since it asks for two, it implies two distinct unique solutions.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** The phrase "relative to the airport runway" followed by "runway points directly towards the radar tower" is a bit convoluted. It essentially means "relative to the radar tower/ground," which is what radar measures anyway. It could be simplified or removed if it doesn't add a necessary conceptual hurdle.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units & Notation):** Consistent units, conventional notation. Assumes speed of light ($c$) is known.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not Multipart):** **Fails.** The question explicitly asks for the speeds of *two* airplanes. This violates the "not multipart" guideline.
*   **Guideline 11 (Question Formatting):** Correct.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1.  **Focus on a single target quantity:** This is the primary issue. Revise the question to ask for only one speed or a single calculated quantity, such as:
    *   "What is the speed of Airplane A relative to the airport runway in m/s?"
    *   "What is the difference in speeds between Airplane A and Airplane B relative to the airport runway in m/s?"
    *   "What is the total speed component of Airplane B towards the airport runway (not necessarily directly towards the tower) in m/s?" (This would add another layer of complexity, making it more unique, but still single output).
2.  **Simplify phrasing:** Rephrase "relative to the airport runway" and the runway alignment information if it doesn't serve a specific conceptual purpose beyond confirming the reference frame. For example, "What is the speed of Airplane A relative to the radar tower in m/s?"

### Question 3 Critique

A plano-convex lens (n=1.6) is used to project an image onto a screen. The lens is placed in a tank filled with water (n=1.33). The radius of curvature of the curved surface of the lens is 30 cm. If an object is placed 60 cm in front of the lens, what is the distance between the lens and the screen where a clear image is formed, in meters?
</question>
```

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Good. A well-defined optical scenario.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Format):** Good. Asks for a single numerical value with units.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, it requires calculating the focal length using the lens maker's formula (considering the surrounding medium) and then using the thin lens equation to find the image distance. This is multi-step.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Reasonably unique. While lens problems are common, placing a plano-convex lens in a different medium is a good variation that tests the lens maker's formula thoroughly.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes, assuming consistent sign conventions for the lens maker's formula, there is a unique solution.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** Good. Clear and concise.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units & Notation):** Consistent units (cm, then asks for meters). Conventional notation.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not Multipart):** Good. Asks for a single quantity.
*   **Guideline 11 (Question Formatting):** Correct.

**Actionable Feedback:**

*   None. This question is strong and meets all the guidelines effectively.

### Question 4 Critique

```xml
<question>
A beam of ultraviolet light with a wavelength of 250 nm is shone onto a metallic surface inside a vacuum tube. The resulting photocurrent is completely stopped when a reverse voltage of 1.8 V is applied between the electrodes. If the wavelength of the incident light is changed to 300 nm, what reverse voltage, in volts, is now required to completely stop the photocurrent?
</question>
```

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Good. A standard photoelectric effect setup.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Format):** Good. Asks for a single numerical value with units.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, it requires using the first set of data to calculate the work function of the metal and then using that work function with the second wavelength to find the new stopping voltage. This is multi-step.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Weakness.** This is a very standard textbook problem variation for the photoelectric effect. While effective, it doesn't offer much novelty.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes, unique solution.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** Good. Clear and concise.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units & Notation):** Consistent units, conventional notation. Assumes Planck's constant ($h$), speed of light ($c$), and electron charge ($e$) are known.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not Multipart):** Good. Asks for a single quantity.
*   **Guideline 11 (Question Formatting):** Correct.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1.  **Improve uniqueness:** While functionally sound, consider a slightly more unique context or application to avoid being a direct rephrasing of common textbook problems. For example, "A photocell is calibrated by measuring the stopping voltage for two different wavelengths..." or "Design an experiment to determine..." but without making it multipart. Alternatively, integrate it into a larger system (e.g., related to sensor design) or ask for a less direct quantity that still requires the same core principles.

### Question 5 Critique

```xml
<question>
A monochromatic X-ray beam with a wavelength of 0.07 nm is incident on a sample of beryllium. A detector is placed at a scattering angle of 60 degrees relative to the incident beam. What is the kinetic energy, in keV, of the recoiling electron? (Use the Compton wavelength $\lambda_C = 0.00243 \, \mathrm{nm}$.)
</question>
```

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Good. A fundamental quantum mechanics scenario (Compton scattering).
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Format):** Good. Asks for a single numerical value with units.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, it requires calculating the scattered wavelength using the Compton formula, then calculating initial and final photon energies, and finally, using conservation of energy to find the electron's kinetic energy. This is robustly multi-step.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Weakness.** Compton scattering problems are common. While asking for the kinetic energy of the recoiling electron (rather than the scattered photon wavelength/energy) is a good variation, it's still a very standard application of the formula.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes, unique solution.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** Good. Clear and concise.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units & Notation):** Consistent units, conventional notation. Providing $\lambda_C$ is helpful. Assumes Planck's constant ($h$) and speed of light ($c$) are known or that $hc$ in eV nm is used.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not Multipart):** Good. Asks for a single quantity.
*   **Guideline 11 (Question Formatting):** Correct.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1.  **Improve uniqueness:** Similar to Question 4, while functionally sound, this is a very standard problem. To improve uniqueness, consider embedding it in a more elaborate or unusual experimental setup, or perhaps involving multiple scattering events (if it can still yield a single numerical answer). For instance, "If the recoiling electron then travels through a 1.5 T magnetic field, what is the radius of its path?" (This would require more data and become multipart, but the idea is to build on the standard problem in a novel way while respecting guidelines). A less complex alternative could be to provide the kinetic energy of the electron and ask for the scattering angle, making it an inverse problem.
