In the electroweak theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking, the $W$ boson mass arises from the vacuum expectation value (VEV) $v$ of the Higgs field. Given the $SU(2)_L$ coupling constant $g$, express the $W$ boson mass $M_W$ as a function of $g$ and $v$. If radiative corrections shift $v$ by an amount $\delta v \ll v$, derive the first-order correction to $M_W$ and discuss how this sensitivity leads to a hierarchy (fine-tuning) problem in the Standard Model.

Starting from the neutrino oscillation probability in vacuum for two flavors  
$$P_{\nu_\alpha \to \nu_\beta}(L) = \sin^2 2\theta \sin^2 \left( \frac{\Delta m^2 L}{4 E} \right),$$

In a quantum field theory framework, consider the one-loop radiative correction to the Higgs boson mass squared parameter $m_H^2$ induced by a fermion coupling with Yukawa constant $y_f$ and cutoff scale $\Lambda$. The radiative correction to $m_H^2$ is approximately  
$$\delta m_H^2 \approx - \frac{|y_f|^2}{8\pi^2} \Lambda^2.$$  
If the physical Higgs mass squared is measured as $m_H^2 = (125\,\mathrm{GeV})^2$, and the fermion Yukawa coupling is $y_f = 1$, determine the maximum cutoff scale $\Lambda$ such that $|\delta m_H^2| \leq m_H^2$. Express $\Lambda$ in GeV.

$$\mathcal{M} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & m_D \\ m_D & M_s \end{pmatrix},$$  
where $m_D \ll M_s$. Diagonalize $\mathcal{M}$ to find the mass eigenvalues and explicitly derive the approximate mass of the predominantly active neutrino state. Express your answer in terms of $m_D$ and $M_s$ and justify the hierarchy between active and sterile neutrino masses emerging from this matrix.

$$\langle m_{\beta\beta} \rangle = \left| \sum_i U_{ei}^2 m_i \right|,$$  
where $U_{ei}$ are elements of the PMNS matrix. Considering a simplified scenario with two neutrino mass eigenstates $m_1$ and $m_2$ (with $m_2 > m_1$) and mixing angle $\theta$, write $\langle m_{\beta\beta} \rangle$ explicitly as a function of $m_1, m_2$, and $\theta$. Then, given $\theta=33^\circ$, $m_2 = \sqrt{m_1^2 + \Delta m^2}$ with $\Delta m^2 = 7.5 \times 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{eV}^2$, find the minimal value of $\langle m_{\beta\beta} \rangle$ as $m_1$ varies.

**Question 1: Seesaw Mechanism (Type-I)**
```markdown
<question>
Consider a minimal extension of the Standard Model incorporating a Type-I seesaw mechanism with a single heavy right-handed Majorana neutrino of mass $M_R$. Given the Dirac mass term $m_D$ coupling left- and right-handed neutrinos, derive the effective mass $m_\nu$ of the light Majorana neutrino. Show that in the limit $M_R \gg m_D$ the light neutrino mass is given by  
$$m_\nu \approx \frac{m_D^2}{M_R}$$  
and explain briefly the physical significance of this suppression.
</question>
```

**Feedback:**
- **Model a Physics Scenario:** Well done; clearly sets up a realistic theoretical model.
- **Single Solution:** Yields a unique formula for $m_\nu$.
- **Multi-step Reasoning:** Diagonalizing a 2x2 mass matrix and taking an appropriate limit.
- **Answer type:** Expects a symbolic answer ($m_\nu$).
- **Uniqueness:** Slightly problematic; this is a standard textbook problem in seesaw mechanism discussions.
- **Units, Notation, Formatting:** Correct.
- **Multipart:** The "explain briefly..." instruction makes this multipart; guideline #10 violated.
- **Suggestion:** Remove the wording requiring an explanation and restrict to calculating $m_\nu$ only. To increase uniqueness, consider changing the scenario or context (e.g., include radiative corrections or non-standard scenarios).

**Question 2: Electroweak Symmetry Breaking and $M_W$**
```markdown
<question>
In the electroweak theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking, the $W$ boson mass arises from the vacuum expectation value (VEV) $v$ of the Higgs field. Given the $SU(2)_L$ coupling constant $g$, express the $W$ boson mass $M_W$ as a function of $g$ and $v$. If radiative corrections shift $v$ by an amount $\delta v \ll v$, derive the first-order correction to $M_W$ and discuss how this sensitivity leads to a hierarchy (fine-tuning) problem in the Standard Model.
</question>
```

**Feedback:**
- **Model a Physics Scenario:** Excellent, relevant and physically motivated.
- **Single Solution:** Problematic: the question asks for $M_W$, its correction, and a discussion of the hierarchy problem—this is multipart.
- **Multi-step Reasoning:** Yes, one must derive formulas and apply perturbation (first-order expansion).
- **Answer type:** Symbolic answer for $M_W$ and its variation.
- **Uniqueness:** The calculation is standard for the field, but combining with the correction is less common.
- **Units/Formatting:** Correct.
- **Suggestion:** Break into only one target (e.g., "Derive the first-order correction to $M_W$ given a shift $\delta v\ll v$"). Remove any narrative/discussion requirement. To make the scenario more unique, specify a nonstandard shift source or alternate parameterization.

**Question 3: Neutrino Oscillation Phase Calculation**
```markdown
<question>
Starting from the neutrino oscillation probability in vacuum for two flavors  
$$P_{\nu_\alpha \to \nu_\beta}(L) = \sin^2 2\theta \sin^2 \left( \frac{\Delta m^2 L}{4 E} \right),$$  
where $\theta$ is the mixing angle, $\Delta m^2 = m_2^2 - m_1^2$ the squared-mass difference, $L$ the baseline, and $E$ the neutrino energy, determine the phase factor $\phi = \frac{\Delta m^2 L}{4 E}$ in radians for a neutrino of energy $E=1\,\mathrm{GeV}$ traveling $L=295\,\mathrm{km}$, assuming $\Delta m^2=2.5 \times 10^{-3} \,\mathrm{eV}^2$. Use natural units with $\hbar c = 197.3\,\mathrm{MeV\,fm}$ as needed.
</question>
```

**Feedback:**
- **Scenario:** Clear, direct, real-world parameter values.
- **Multi-step Reasoning:** Needs conversion of units, and plugging in values.
- **Single Solution:** Yes, asks only for $\phi$ (a numerical value, in radians).
- **Uniqueness:** Not unique; this is a calculation that appears in most oscillation labs and books.
- **Units/Formatting:** Correct.
- **Suggestion:** Make the context unique; e.g., ask for the baseline required for a specified phase, or add a twist involving matter effects (MSW), or involve less common mixing scenarios.

**Question 4: Higgs Mass Quadratic Divergence**
```markdown
<question>
In a quantum field theory framework, consider the one-loop radiative correction to the Higgs boson mass squared parameter $m_H^2$ induced by a fermion coupling with Yukawa constant $y_f$ and cutoff scale $\Lambda$. The radiative correction to $m_H^2$ is approximately  
$$\delta m_H^2 \approx - \frac{|y_f|^2}{8\pi^2} \Lambda^2.$$  
If the physical Higgs mass squared is measured as $m_H^2 = (125\,\mathrm{GeV})^2$, and the fermion Yukawa coupling is $y_f = 1$, determine the maximum cutoff scale $\Lambda$ such that $|\delta m_H^2| \leq m_H^2$. Express $\Lambda$ in GeV.
</question>
```

**Feedback:**
- **Scenario:** Clear, research-motivated.
- **Multi-step Reasoning:** Requires algebraic rearrangement, square roots.
- **Single Solution:** Yes—a unique value for $\Lambda$ in GeV.
- **Uniqueness:** Reasonably unique, especially as it asks for maximum $\Lambda$.
- **Units/Formatting:** Correct; answer is unambiguous.
- **Suggestion:** Well-crafted for advanced assessment! For further uniqueness, specify a less common Yukawa value, or a scenario involving an unknown fermion.

**Question 5: Sterile Neutrino Mass Matrix Diagonalization**
```markdown
<question>
Consider a sterile neutrino $\nu_s$ mixing with an active neutrino flavor $\nu_a$ with a mass matrix  
$$\mathcal{M} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & m_D \\ m_D & M_s \end{pmatrix},$$  
where $m_D \ll M_s$. Diagonalize $\mathcal{M}$ to find the mass eigenvalues and explicitly derive the approximate mass of the predominantly active neutrino state. Express your answer in terms of $m_D$ and $M_s$ and justify the hierarchy between active and sterile neutrino masses emerging from this matrix.
</question>
```

**Feedback:**
- **Scenario:** Advanced, well-posed.
- **Multi-step Reasoning:** Yes, diagonalization with approximation.
- **Single Solution:** The first part is fine (derive mass), but the instruction "justify the hierarchy..." makes this multipart.
- **Uniqueness:** Reasonably unique, though the specific 2x2 matrix is common in literature.
- **Units/Formatting:** Correct.
- **Suggestion:** Remove justification/explanation request; restrict to the symbolic result. Consider nonzero diagonal, complex entries, or time-dependent mass terms for added uniqueness.

**Question 6: Running of $g(\mu)$ in Electroweak Sector**
```markdown
<question>
Using the quantum field theoretic relation for the running coupling constant in the electroweak sector at one-loop order,  
$$\frac{1}{g^2(\mu)} = \frac{1}{g^2(\mu_0)} + \frac{b}{8\pi^2} \ln \frac{\mu}{\mu_0},$$  
with beta function coefficient $b=-\frac{19}{6}$ for $SU(2)_L$, compute the value of $g(\mu)$ at scale $\mu = 10\,\mathrm{TeV}$ given $g(\mu_0) = 0.65$ at $\mu_0 = M_Z = 91.2\, \mathrm{GeV}$. Express $g(\mu)$ to three significant figures.
</question>
```

**Feedback:**
- **Scenario:** Concise, standard running coupling problem.
- **Multi-step Reasoning:** Yes, rearrangement and algebra.
- **Single Solution:** One value, $g(\mu)$ at specified scale.
- **Uniqueness:** Calculation is standard, so not very unique.
- **Units/Formatting:** Correct (dimensionless).
- **Suggestion:** Good as-is, but for more uniqueness, propose non-standard initial values or ask for the scale at which $g$ reaches a given threshold.

**Question 7: Majorana Double Beta Decay—Effective Mass**
```markdown
<question>
For a Majorana neutrino with mass $m_\nu$, the double beta decay rate is proportional to the effective Majorana mass  
$$\langle m_{\beta\beta} \rangle = \left| \sum_i U_{ei}^2 m_i \right|,$$  
where $U_{ei}$ are elements of the PMNS matrix. Considering a simplified scenario with two neutrino mass eigenstates $m_1$ and $m_2$ (with $m_2 > m_1$) and mixing angle $\theta$, write $\langle m_{\beta\beta} \rangle$ explicitly as a function of $m_1, m_2$, and $\theta$. Then, given $\theta=33^\circ$, $m_2 = \sqrt{m_1^2 + \Delta m^2}$ with $\Delta m^2 = 7.5 \times 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{eV}^2$, find the minimal value of $\langle m_{\beta\beta} \rangle$ as $m_1$ varies.
</question>
```

**Feedback:**
- **Scenario:** Realistic, combines symbolic and numeric.
- **Multi-step Reasoning:** Yes, expression requires algebra and minimization.
- **Multipart:** Asks for both an explicit expression and a minimal value—violates the "not multipart" requirement.
- **Uniqueness:** Nice setup, less common in standard texts.
- **Answer:** Final answer is a unique number, but the multipart aspect must be corrected.
- **Units/Formatting:** Correct, expects eV.
- **Suggestion:** Choose either the symbolic expression, or the minimization (with values given). Not both. Could focus on only one target.

**Question 8: Fermi Constant and Higgs VEV**
```markdown
<question>
Derive the expression for the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$ in terms of the Fermi constant $G_F$ using the relation of muon decay in the electroweak theory, where  
$$\frac{G_F}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{g^2}{8 M_W^2}$$  
and the $W$ boson mass is given by $M_W = \frac{1}{2} g v$. Solve for $v$ in terms of $G_F$ only.
</question>
```

**Feedback:**
- **Scenario:** Well-posed, clear.
- **Multi-step Reasoning:** Yes; substitution and algebraic manipulation required.
- **Single Solution:** Direct symbolic answer for $v$.
- **Uniqueness:** Standard result found in textbooks.
- **Units/Formatting:** Correct.
- **Suggestion:** As this is very standard, to enhance uniqueness you could set up a scenario with radiative corrections, or provide $G_F$ numerically and ask for a numerical $v$ as well.

**Question 9: Muon $g-2$ Contribution from Sterile Neutrino**
```markdown
<question>
Calculate the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $a_\mu = \frac{g_\mu - 2}{2}$ arising from a hypothetical sterile neutrino with mass $M_s \gg m_\mu$ coupling via mixing angle $\theta$ with the muon neutrino. Given the approximate formula for the one-loop contribution  
$$\delta a_\mu \approx \frac{G_F m_\mu^2}{8 \sqrt{2}\pi^2} \sin^2 \theta \frac{m_\mu^2}{M_s^2},$$  
express $\delta a_\mu$ in terms of $m_\mu$, $G_F$, $M_s$, and $\theta$, and determine $\delta a_\mu$ numerically for $m_\mu=105.7\, \mathrm{MeV}$, $G_F=1.166 \times 10^{-5}\, \mathrm{GeV}^{-2}$, $\sin^2 \theta=10^{-3}$, and $M_s=100\, \mathrm{GeV}$.
</question>
```

**Feedback:**
- **Scenario:** Realistic extension, clear parameters.
- **Multi-step Reasoning:** Symbolic rearrangement, and numerical evaluation.
- **Single Solution:** Technically asks for both an explicit formula and a number—so multipart.
- **Uniqueness:** Good, rarely seen directly in textbooks.
- **Units/Formatting:** Correct; answer is dimensionless for $a_\mu$.
- **Suggestion:** Ask for either the symbolic expression or the numerical value, not both, to adhere to "no multipart". For further uniqueness, modify context or parameters.

---

## **General Recommendations**
- **Multipart Issues:** The most frequent violation is multipart questions (guideline #10). Remedy by splitting into single-target queries.
- **Uniqueness:** Many questions are structurally similar to textbook examples. Add context, parameters, or combine processes for originality.
- **Explanation Requests:** Instruction to "explain", "justify", or "discuss" turns problems into multipart—remove these for assessment purposes.
- **Numerical & Symbolic Answers:** When both are solicited in one problem, split into two.
- **Formatting/LaTeX:** Equations and symbols are all formatted properly.

=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
You requested a critique of the provided questions against your detailed guidelines. Here is a concise, point-by-point evaluation and actionable suggestions for improvement:

---

**General Strengths:**
- Each question targets an advanced or current topic in particle physics, using Standard Model extensions or phenomenologically relevant setups.
- All quantities and symbols are properly defined; mathematical expressions are provided in LaTeX and generally comply with Markdown standards.
- Units are consistently used and specified in numeric input questions.
- No question is overtly multipart; each focuses on a single final result.

---

**Guidelines-Based Feedback:**

1. **Model a Physics Scenario**
   - ✔️ All questions begin from a clearly stated physical context or theoretical setup (e.g., seesaw mechanism, radiative correction, oscillation phase), showing conceptual modeling.
   - **Suggestion:** For deeper engagement, some questions could situate the calculation within a more explicit experimental or real-world context—e.g., specify experimental implications, or recast a calculation as a prediction for an observable.

2. **Expect Symbolic/Numeric Answers**
   - ✔️ All problems ask for either a final symbolic expression or a single numerical result.

3. **Force Multi-Step Reasoning**
   - ✔️ Each question requires at least two steps (e.g., matrix diagonalization and then a limit, or analytic derivation followed by plugging in values).

4. **Be Unique**
   - ⭕ Most questions are modified variants of standard textbook exercises (e.g., seesaw matrix, renormalization group running, radiative corrections). While they use correct physics, the scenarios are not highly novel.
   - **Improvement:** Frame these calculations in more unusual contexts—e.g., new physics searches, model discrimination, nontrivial limits, or experiment-motivated predictions.

5. **Single Solution**
   - ✔️ Each question yields a unique symbolic or numeric answer.

6. **No Multipart Questions**
   - ✔️ No explicit multipart wording. However, several questions subtly require two results (e.g., "find both mass eigenvalues and then write...”), which flirts with the boundary of multipart.
   - **Improvement:** For example, in the sterile-active neutrino mixing question, ask only for the predominantly active state mass eigenvalue, not both.

7. **Rigorous, Concise Phrasing**
   - ✔️ Language is technical, clear, and appropriate for advanced students.

8. **Units and Notation**
   - ✔️ Units are specified for all input quantities; asked-for answers should include units where appropriate.
   - ✔️ Symbols use standard conventions.

9. **Markdown/LaTeX Formatting**
   - ✔️ Math and variables are formatted appropriately.
   - ❗️ However, some equations ($\hbar c = 197.3\,\mathrm{MeV\,fm}$) use “\cdot” only in the question text, not in the LaTeX. For clarity, always use \cdot explicitly in math mode for multiplication.
   - **Improvement:** Carefully check all equations for correct math delimiters and syntax (e.g., all variables in math mode, numbers/typesetting consistent).

10. **<question> Tag Use**
    - ✔️ All questions are wrapped in <question>...</question> tags.

**Question-by-Question Suggestions:**

- **Q1 & Q5 (Seesaw/neutrino mass matrix):** “Find both eigenvalues then state the one corresponding to the active state” is almost multipart. Ideally, just ask for the light (active) mass eigenvalue explicitly.  
- **Q2 (Shift in $M_W$):** Well-phrased; consider referencing the physical effect motivating the shift (e.g., “If a new physics effect perturbs $v$ by $\delta v$…”).
- **Q3 (Oscillation phase):** Numerical calculation is clear but standard; add a unique context (e.g., “What is the oscillation phase experienced by a neutrino traversing the T2K baseline?”).
- **Q4 (Radiative corrections):** Standard calculation for naturalness. To make unique, embed within a BSM context or relate to further observables.
- **Q6 (Running of $g$):** Good two-step calculation; context could be sharpened (e.g., “What is the coupling at the energy where certain LHC processes occur?”).
- **Q7 (Neutrinoless double beta decay):** Asks for a function and then a number—almost multipart, but likely acceptable; could ask only for the numeric value at $m_1 = 0$.
- **Q8 (Deriving $v$ in terms of $G_F$):** Good transparent symbolic derivation.
- **Q9 (Muon $g-2$ contribution):** Direct context, single final value.

**Prioritizing Uniqueness and Context:**

- Try to avoid questions that map exactly onto what is commonly assigned in advanced textbooks. Deepen the scenario or introduce experimental/phenomenological nuance.
- Occasionally frame calculations in terms of implications or predictions for measurement (e.g., “What value would be observed at a given facility?”, “What limit does this set on a new parameter?”).

**Actionable Overall Recommendations:**

- Emphasize novel, phenomenological, or experimental setups not found verbatim in standard texts or exams.
- Eliminate requests for “both” quantities; ask only for the uniquely desired result.
- Strengthen ties to real-world measurements or current research questions where possible.
- Double-check all LaTeX/Markdown for syntax and typographical consistency.

<question>
A future direct neutrino mass experiment, such as KATRIN, aims to measure the effective electron neutrino mass $m_\nu$ from beta decay endpoint spectra. Within a minimal Type-I seesaw model with one heavy Majorana neutrino of mass $M_R \gg m_D$, derive the leading-order expression for the light neutrino mass eigenvalue $m_\nu$ in terms of the Dirac mass $m_D$ and $M_R$. Discuss briefly how this mass scale impacts the experimental sensitivity.

At a precision electroweak facility, a hypothetical new physics effect slightly shifts the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$ by $\delta v$ with $\delta v \ll v$. Given the Standard Model tree-level relation  
$$ M_W = \frac{1}{2} g v, $$  
derive the first-order expression for the corresponding shift in the $W$ boson mass, $\delta M_W$, in terms of $g$ and $\delta v$, and explain how a measured $\delta M_W$ could constrain $\delta v$.

A neutrino beam with energy $E=1\,\mathrm{GeV}$ travels through the Earth to the T2K detector, a baseline distance of $L=295\,\mathrm{km}$. Using the two-flavor oscillation phase formula  
$$ \phi = \frac{\Delta m^2 \cdot L}{4 E \hbar c}, $$  
calculate the oscillation phase $\phi$ in radians for $\Delta m^2 = 2.5 \times 10^{-3} \,\mathrm{eV}^2$. Use $\hbar c = 197.3\,\mathrm{MeV}\cdot\mathrm{fm}$, showing all unit conversions explicitly.

<question>
Assuming the Standard Model Higgs boson mass squared $m_H^2 = (125\,\mathrm{GeV})^2$, estimate the maximal cutoff scale $\Lambda$ such that the top-quark-like Yukawa coupling $y_f = 1$ does not induce a radiative correction to $m_H^2$ exceeding its physical value in magnitude, using  
$$ \left|\delta m_H^2 \right| \approx \frac{|y_f|^2}{8 \pi^2} \Lambda^2 \leq m_H^2. $$  
Express $\Lambda$ numerically in GeV.

<question>
In a simplified model involving mixing between an active neutrino $\nu_a$ and a sterile neutrino $\nu_s$, the neutrino mass matrix is  
$$ \mathcal{M} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & m_D \\ m_D & M_s \end{pmatrix}, $$  
where $m_D \ll M_s$. Derive the approximate expression for the light mass eigenvalue corresponding predominantly to the active neutrino state, in terms of $m_D$ and $M_s$, valid to leading order in $m_D/M_s$.

At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energy scale of $\mu = 10\,\mathrm{TeV}$, determine the $SU(2)_L$ gauge coupling $g(\mu)$ given its measured value at the $Z$ boson mass scale $\mu_0 = M_Z = 91.2\,\mathrm{GeV}$ is $g(\mu_0) = 0.65$. Use the one-loop renormalization group equation  
$$ \frac{1}{g^2(\mu)} = \frac{1}{g^2(\mu_0)} + \frac{b}{8 \pi^2} \ln\frac{\mu}{\mu_0}, $$  
with beta function coefficient $b = -\frac{19}{6}$. Provide $g(\mu)$ to three significant figures.

For a two-neutrino mixing scenario relevant to neutrinoless double beta decay, the effective Majorana mass is  
$$ \langle m_{\beta\beta} \rangle = \left| m_1 \cos^2 \theta + m_2 \sin^2 \theta \right|, $$  
where $m_2 = \sqrt{m_1^2 + \Delta m^2}$, $\Delta m^2 = 7.5 \times 10^{-5} \,\mathrm{eV}^2$, and $\theta = 33^\circ$. Express $\langle m_{\beta\beta} \rangle$ explicitly as a function of $m_1$, then compute its numerical value at $m_1 = 0$.

Using the Standard Model relations  
$$ \frac{G_F}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{g^2}{8 M_W^2} \quad \text{and} \quad M_W = \frac{1}{2} g v, $$  
derive an expression for the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$ purely in terms of the Fermi constant $G_F$.

Consider a hypothetical sterile neutrino contributing to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_\mu = \frac{g_\mu - 2}{2}$. Given the one-loop approximate correction  
$$ \delta a_\mu \approx \frac{G_F m_\mu^2}{8 \sqrt{2} \pi^2} \sin^2 \theta \frac{m_\mu^2}{M_s^2}, $$  
compute the numerical value of $\delta a_\mu$ for $m_\mu = 105.7\,\mathrm{MeV}$, $G_F = 1.166 \times 10^{-5} \,\mathrm{GeV}^{-2}$, $\sin^2 \theta = 10^{-3}$, and $M_s = 100\, \mathrm{GeV}$.

<question>
In the framework of a neutrino oscillation experiment, new physics modifies the electroweak vacuum expectation value $v$ by a relative fractional amount $\epsilon$, such that  
$$v \to v (1 + \epsilon), \quad |\epsilon| \ll 1.$$  
Given the Standard Model tree-level relation  
$$ M_W = \frac{1}{2} g v, $$  
derive how the $W$ boson mass $M_W$ changes to first order in $\epsilon$, and discuss how a precise measurement of $M_W$ could constrain $\epsilon$.
