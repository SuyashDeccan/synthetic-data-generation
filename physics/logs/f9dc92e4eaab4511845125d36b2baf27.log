In a theoretical extension of the Standard Model, a scalar leptoquark $\phi$ couples to a left-handed quark doublet $Q_L$ and a left-handed lepton doublet $L_L$ with a coupling strength $\lambda$. The interaction Lagrangian is given by $\mathcal{L} = \lambda \phi^\dagger \overline{Q_L} L_L + \text{h.c.}$. If the leptoquark has a mass of $M_{\phi} = 1 \, \mathrm{TeV}$ and the decay width of the leptoquark into the quark and lepton is observed to be $\Gamma_{\phi} = 10 \, \mathrm{GeV}$, calculate the value of the coupling strength $\lambda$, assuming the leptoquark decays only into this channel and ignoring kinematic factors.

Consider a scenario where the Standard Model Higgs boson, with a mass of $m_H = 125 \, \mathrm{GeV}$, receives radiative corrections from a new heavy fermion with mass $M_F = 10^{15} \, \mathrm{GeV}$. The contribution to the Higgs mass-squared from these radiative corrections is given by $\Delta m_H^2 \approx \frac{\Lambda^2}{16\pi^2}$, where $\Lambda$ is the cutoff scale, which we take to be $M_F$. To maintain the Higgs mass at its observed value, a fine-tuning mechanism must cancel these corrections. Calculate the level of fine-tuning required, defined as the ratio $\frac{m_H^2}{\Delta m_H^2}$.

A simplified model introduces a new force mediated by a massive vector boson $V$ with mass $M_V = 5 \, \mathrm{TeV}$. This force couples to quarks with a universal coupling strength $g_V$. At an energy scale $Q = 1 \, \mathrm{TeV}$, the strong coupling constant is $\alpha_s(Q) = 0.118$. Assuming that at the scale $M_V$, the new force has a similar strength to the strong force, such that $\alpha_V(M_V) = \frac{g_V^2}{4\pi} = \alpha_s(M_V)$, calculate $g_V$ given that $\alpha_s(M_V)$ evolves according to the Renormalization Group Equation with the initial condition $\alpha_s(Q)$. Assume a one-loop approximation with $b_0 = (33 - 2n_f)/(12\pi)$ with $n_f=6$, and the evolution equation can be integrated as $\alpha_s^{-1}(M_V) = \alpha_s^{-1}(Q) + b_0 \ln(M_V^2/Q^2)$.

Here's a critique of the provided questions, evaluated against your guidelines:

### **Question 1: Sterile Neutrino Seesaw Mechanism**

```xml
<question>
A hypothetical sterile neutrino, $N$, with Majorana mass $M_N$, interacts with the Standard Model neutrino, $\nu_L$, via a Yukawa coupling $y_{\nu}$. Assuming the active neutrino mass, $m_{\nu}$, arises solely from the seesaw mechanism, and given that $m_{\nu} = 0.1 \, \mathrm{eV}$ and $M_N = 10^{10} \, \mathrm{GeV}$, determine the value of the Yukawa coupling $y_{\nu}$. Express your answer to three significant figures.
</question>
```

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Physics Scenario)**: Excellent. This models a well-known and crucial concept in particle physics (Type-I seesaw mechanism), requiring conceptual understanding of neutrino mass generation.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning)**: Good. It requires recalling the seesaw formula ($m_\nu \propto y_\nu^2 v^2 / M_N$) and the approximate value of the Higgs VEV ($v \approx 246 \, \mathrm{GeV}$), which are standard knowledge for advanced learners, and then performing the calculation.
*   **Guideline 7 (Units Consistent)**: Consistent units for input, but the calculation requires knowledge of the Higgs VEV in GeV and potentially unit conversion between eV and GeV.
*   **Formatting**: Correct.

**Improvement:**
*   Explicitly state the Higgs vacuum expectation value (e.g., "$v = 246 \, \mathrm{GeV}$") in the problem statement. While it's a fundamental constant in particle physics, providing it removes ambiguity and ensures the focus is on applying the seesaw formula and not recalling a specific numerical value.

---

### **Question 2: Z' Boson Mass from Higgs Mechanism**

```xml
<question>
Consider a simplified electroweak model where the Higgs field has a vacuum expectation value $v = 246 \, \mathrm{GeV}$. A new, heavy neutral gauge boson, $Z'$, interacts with the Standard Model fermions with a coupling strength $g_{Z'} = 0.1$. If the mass of the $Z'$ boson, $M_{Z'}$, arises solely from the Higgs mechanism, calculate the numerical value of $M_{Z'}$ in GeV.
</question>
```

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Physics Scenario)**: Good. Models a common BSM extension and tests understanding of gauge boson mass generation via the Higgs mechanism.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning)**: Borderline. This is a direct application of the formula $M = \frac{1}{2} g v$. While knowing and applying this formula is a key piece of particle physics knowledge, the calculation itself is a single arithmetic step.
*   **Formatting**: Correct.

**Improvement:**
*   To more strongly enforce "multi-step reasoning," consider an intermediate step. For example, by specifying the $Z'$ arises from a new $U(1)$ gauge group whose coupling is related to other known quantities, requiring calculation of $g_{Z'}$ first, or by asking for a quantity that requires manipulating this formula along with another principle. As is, it's a very direct test of a single formula.

### **Question 3: Leptoquark Decay Width**

```xml
<question>
In a theoretical extension of the Standard Model, a scalar leptoquark $\phi$ couples to a left-handed quark doublet $Q_L$ and a left-handed lepton doublet $L_L$ with a coupling strength $\lambda$. The interaction Lagrangian is given by $\mathcal{L} = \lambda \phi^\dagger \overline{Q_L} L_L + \text{h.c.}$. If the leptoquark has a mass of $M_{\phi} = 1 \, \mathrm{TeV}$ and the decay width of the leptoquark into the quark and lepton is observed to be $\Gamma_{\phi} = 10 \, \mathrm{GeV}$, calculate the value of the coupling strength $\lambda$, assuming the leptoquark decays only into this channel and ignoring kinematic factors.
</question>
```

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Physics Scenario)**: Good. Models a common type of BSM particle (leptoquark) and tests understanding of decay width calculations from a Lagrangian.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning)**: Borderline. Similar to Question 2, this is a direct application of a standard decay width formula (e.g., $\Gamma = \frac{|\lambda|^2}{8\pi} M_\phi$ for a scalar decaying to two massless fermions, which is implied by "ignoring kinematic factors"). The calculation is a single arithmetic step once the formula is recalled.
*   **Formatting**: Correct.

**Improvement:**
*   Similar to Question 2, to enforce "multi-step reasoning," consider introducing an additional calculation step. For instance, if the leptoquark had multiple decay channels with given branching ratios, and the student had to infer the partial width for this specific channel first, or if the coupling $\lambda$ was derived from another fundamental symmetry.

### **Question 4: Higgs Mass Fine-Tuning**

```xml
<question>
Consider a scenario where the Standard Model Higgs boson, with a mass of $m_H = 125 \, \mathrm{GeV}$, receives radiative corrections from a new heavy fermion with mass $M_F = 10^{15} \, \mathrm{GeV}$. The contribution to the Higgs mass-squared from these radiative corrections is given by $\Delta m_H^2 \approx \frac{\Lambda^2}{16\pi^2}$, where $\Lambda$ is the cutoff scale, which we take to be $M_F$. To maintain the Higgs mass at its observed value, a fine-tuning mechanism must cancel these corrections. Calculate the level of fine-tuning required, defined as the ratio $\frac{m_H^2}{\Delta m_H^2}$.
</question>
```

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Physics Scenario)**: Excellent. This question directly addresses a significant conceptual problem in particle physics (the hierarchy problem and naturalness), requiring deep understanding beyond mere formula application.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning)**: Excellent. This clearly involves multiple distinct steps: calculating $\Delta m_H^2$, calculating $m_H^2$, and then forming their ratio.
*   **Formatting**: Correct.

**Improvement:**
*   None. This question is very well-designed and meets all specified guidelines effectively.

### **Question 5: Running Coupling Constant and New Force**

```xml
<question>
A simplified model introduces a new force mediated by a massive vector boson $V$ with mass $M_V = 5 \, \mathrm{TeV}$. This force couples to quarks with a universal coupling strength $g_V$. At an energy scale $Q = 1 \, \mathrm{TeV}$, the strong coupling constant is $\alpha_s(Q) = 0.118$. Assuming that at the scale $M_V$, the new force has a similar strength to the strong force, such that $\alpha_V(M_V) = \frac{g_V^2}{4\pi} = \alpha_s(M_V)$, calculate $g_V$ given that $\alpha_s(M_V)$ evolves according to the Renormalization Group Equation with the initial condition $\alpha_s(Q)$. Assume a one-loop approximation with $b_0 = (33 - 2n_f)/(12\pi)$ with $n_f=6$, and the evolution equation can be integrated as $\alpha_s^{-1}(M_V) = \alpha_s^{-1}(Q) + b_0 \ln(M_V^2/Q^2)$. Report your answer as a single number to three significant figures.
</question>
```

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Physics Scenario)**: Excellent. This question covers the fundamental concept of running coupling constants and applies it to a BSM scenario.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning)**: Excellent. This question requires several distinct calculation steps: computing $b_0$, calculating inverse couplings, applying the RGE, and then solving for $g_V$.
*   **Formatting**: Correct.

**Improvement:**
*   None. This question is also very well-designed and meets all specified guidelines effectively.

**Overall Summary and Final Feedback:**

These questions are strong examples for an advanced particle physics assessment. They cover relevant and challenging topics within high-energy physics. Questions 4 and 5 are particularly excellent in their design, perfectly fulfilling the "multi-step reasoning" guideline while remaining concise and clear. Questions 1, 2, and 3 are also good, but their "multi-step reasoning" relies more heavily on the implicit expectation of recalling specific standard formulas and constants (like the Higgs VEV). Explicitly stating all numerical constants, or making the intermediate steps more complex, would slightly improve the consistency across all questions regarding "multi-step reasoning." The LaTeX/Markdown formatting is consistently correct throughout.

*   **Critique:** This is an excellent question.
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Models a clear and relevant high-energy physics scenario (seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass).
    *   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Expects a single numerical value, clearly specifying precision.

**Question 2: New $Z'$ Gauge Boson Mass**

```xml
<question>
Consider a simplified electroweak model where a new $U(1)'$ gauge group is introduced, leading to a new heavy neutral gauge boson, $Z'$. The Higgs field $\Phi$ is charged under this $U(1)'$ and acquires a vacuum expectation value $v' = 1000 \, \mathrm{GeV}$. The kinetic mixing between the $Z'$ and the Standard Model $Z$ boson is negligible. Given that the $Z'$ mass arises solely from the Higgs mechanism via the interaction term $\mathcal{L} \supset g' v' Z'_\mu Z'^\mu$, where $g'=0.2$ is the $U(1)'$ gauge coupling, calculate the numerical value of $M_{Z'}$ in GeV.
</question>
```

*   **Critique:** This question has a significant flaw regarding the specified interaction term.
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Good, introduces a new gauge boson and mass generation.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Correctly expects a numerical value in GeV.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Intends to, but the problematic term complicates it.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Scenario is novel.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** This is where it fails. The given interaction term $\mathcal{L} \supset g' v' Z'_\mu Z'^\mu$ is dimensionally inconsistent for a mass term. A mass term for a vector boson is usually written as $\frac{1}{2} M^2 Z'_\mu Z'^\mu$. If $g' v' Z'_\mu Z'^\mu$ *is* this term, then $M_{Z'}^2 = g' v'$ (ignoring the factor of 1/2), implying $M_{Z'} = \sqrt{g'v'}$. However, $g'v'$ has units of GeV, so $\sqrt{g'v'}$ would have units of $\sqrt{\mathrm{GeV}}$, which is not a mass unit. The *standard* result for a gauge boson mass from Higgs mechanism is $M_{Z'} = g'v'$, which means the mass term in the Lagrangian would be $\frac{1}{2} (g'v')^2 Z'_\mu Z'^\mu$. The current phrasing implies the mass term is not squared, making it dimensionally inconsistent.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** Fails due to the imprecise and dimensionally problematic definition of the interaction term. It leads to ambiguity on how to derive the mass.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units & Symbols):** Units are consistent if one *assumes* the intended formula $M_{Z'} = g'v'$, but not if one strictly interprets the given Lagrangian term.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Not Multipart):** Focuses on a single quantity.
    *   **Guideline 11 (Question Formatting):** Correctly uses LaTeX with Markdown for inline math and is wrapped in `<question>` tags.

*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   Rephrase the interaction term to be dimensionally consistent with a mass. For example, specify: "Given that the $Z'$ mass arises solely from the Higgs mechanism and is given by $M_{Z'} = g'v'$, where $g'=0.2$ is the $U(1)'$ gauge coupling and $v'=1000 \, \mathrm{GeV}$ is the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field."
    *   Alternatively, if the intent is to use a specific Lagrangian, clearly state the full mass term form: "The $Z'$ mass arises from the Higgs mechanism, leading to a mass term $\mathcal{L} \supset \frac{1}{2} (g'v')^2 Z'_\mu Z'^\mu$, where $g'=0.2$ is the $U(1)'$ gauge coupling and $v'=1000 \, \mathrm{GeV}$ is the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field."

**Question 3: Scalar Leptoquark Decay**

```xml
<question>
In a theoretical extension of the Standard Model, a scalar leptoquark $\phi$ couples to a left-handed quark doublet $Q_L$ and a left-handed lepton doublet $L_L$ with a coupling strength $\lambda$. The interaction Lagrangian is given by $\mathcal{L} = \lambda \phi^\dagger \overline{Q_L} L_L + \text{h.c.}$. The leptoquark has a mass of $M_{\phi} = 1 \, \mathrm{TeV}$ and can decay into two channels: a quark-lepton pair ($Q_L L_L$) with branching ratio $BR_1 = 0.6$ and a quark-neutrino pair ($Q_L \nu_L$) with branching ratio $BR_2 = 0.4$. The observed total decay width of the leptoquark is $\Gamma_{\phi} = 15 \, \mathrm{GeV}$. Calculate the value of the coupling strength $\lambda$ for the decay into the quark-lepton channel, assuming this decay dominates the total decay width, and the kinematic factor $S = \frac{1}{8\pi}$, such that  $\Gamma( \phi \rightarrow Q_L L_L) = S |\lambda|^2 M_{\phi}$.
</question>
```

*   **Critique:** This question has a minor contradiction in its phrasing.
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Good, introduces a theoretical particle and its decay properties.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Correctly expects a single numerical value (dimensionless).
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Requires calculating the partial width from total width and branching ratio, then solving for the coupling strength. This is multi-step.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** The scenario is unique and conceptually rich.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yields a unique numerical answer, assuming the intended interpretation.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** Generally good, but the phrase "assuming this decay dominates the total decay width" contradicts the explicitly given branching ratios ($BR_1 = 0.6$ and $BR_2 = 0.4$). If it dominates, $BR_1$ would be close to 1. Given specific branching ratios are provided, they should be used.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units & Symbols):** Consistent units, standard symbols.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Not Multipart):** Focuses on a single quantity.
    *   **Guideline 11 (Question Formatting):** Correctly uses LaTeX with Markdown for inline math and is wrapped in `<question>` tags.

*   **Actionable Feedback:** Remove the phrase "assuming this decay dominates the total decay width". The provided branching ratios already specify the contribution of each decay, and the calculation should use $BR_1=0.6$. The intent is likely that the formula for $\Gamma(\phi \rightarrow Q_L L_L)$ is provided, and this partial width needs to be isolated using the branching ratio.

In a theoretical extension of the Standard Model, a scalar leptoquark $\phi$ couples to a left-handed quark doublet $Q_L$ and a left-handed lepton doublet $L_L$ with a coupling strength $\lambda$. The interaction Lagrangian is given by $\mathcal{L} = \lambda \phi^\dagger \overline{Q_L} L_L + \text{h.c.}$. The leptoquark has a mass of $M_{\phi} = 1 \, \mathrm{TeV}$ and can decay into two channels: a quark-lepton pair ($Q_L L_L$) with branching ratio $BR_1 = 0.6$ and a quark-neutrino pair ($Q_L \nu_L$) with branching ratio $BR_2 = 0.4$. The observed total decay width of the leptoquark is $\Gamma_{\phi} = 15 \, \mathrm{GeV}$. Calculate the value of the coupling strength $\lambda$ for the decay into the quark-lepton channel, given the kinematic factor $S = \frac{1}{8\pi}$, such that  $\Gamma( \phi \rightarrow Q_L L_L) = S |\lambda|^2 M_{\phi}$.

Consider a scenario where the Standard Model Higgs boson, with a mass of $m_H = 125 \, \mathrm{GeV}$, receives radiative corrections from a new heavy fermion with mass $M_F = 10^{15} \, \mathrm{GeV}$. The contribution to the Higgs mass-squared from these radiative corrections is given by $\Delta m_H^2 \approx \frac{\Lambda^2}{16\pi^2}$, where $\Lambda$ is the cutoff scale, which we take to be $M_F$. To maintain the Higgs mass at its observed value, a fine-tuning mechanism must cancel these corrections. Calculate the level of fine-tuning required, defined as the ratio $\frac{m_H^2}{\Delta m_H^2}$.

A simplified model introduces a new force mediated by a massive vector boson $V$ with mass $M_V = 5 \, \mathrm{TeV}$. This force couples to quarks with a universal coupling strength $g_V$. At an energy scale $Q = 1 \, \mathrm{TeV}$, the strong coupling constant is $\alpha_s(Q) = 0.118$. Assuming that at the scale $M_V$, the new force has a similar strength to the strong force, such that $\alpha_V(M_V) = \frac{g_V^2}{4\pi} = \alpha_s(M_V)$, calculate $g_V$ given that $\alpha_s(M_V)$ evolves according to the Renormalization Group Equation with the initial condition $\alpha_s(Q)$. Assume a one-loop approximation with $b_0 = (33 - 2n_f)/(12\pi)$ with $n_f=6$, and the evolution equation can be integrated as $\alpha_s^{-1}(M_V) = \alpha_s^{-1}(Q) + b_0 \ln(M_V^2/Q^2)$. Report your answer as a single number to three significant figures.
