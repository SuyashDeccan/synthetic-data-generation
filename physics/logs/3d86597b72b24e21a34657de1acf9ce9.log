**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Well-modeled.
*   **Guideline 2 (Expected Answer Type):** Correct (numerical with units).
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, requires relativistic velocity transformation for light (angle transformation), which involves multiple steps.
*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** This is a very common, standard problem for relativistic velocity addition for light.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** Yes.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Good phrasing, no hints.

<question>
A particle with charge $q = 2 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C}$ moves with a velocity $\vec{v} = (3 \times 10^7 \, \mathrm{m/s}, 0, 0)$ in a region with a magnetic field $\vec{B} = (0, 0, 0.5 \, \mathrm{T})$. Determine the magnitude of the relativistic Lorentz force acting on the particle. Assume that the particle's motion is described by the relativistic form of the Lorentz force equation.
</question>
**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Well-modeled.
*   **Guideline 2 (Expected Answer Type):** Correct (numerical with units).
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** This is the main point of concern. The Lorentz force itself, $\vec{F} = q(\vec{v} \times \vec{B})$, is generally considered valid in all inertial frames. The "relativistic form" typically refers to how this force *changes the relativistic momentum* ($\vec{F} = \frac{d}{dt}(\gamma m \vec{v})$) rather than adding a $\gamma$ factor *to the force magnitude itself*. In this specific setup ($\vec{v} \perp \vec{B}$, no E-field), the force magnitude is simply $qvB$, regardless of $\gamma$. This makes it a very direct calculation rather than a complex multi-step relativistic dynamics problem.
*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** Application of Lorentz force is standard. The "relativistic" aspect for the force *magnitude* in this specific scenario is either a trick or a conceptual misunderstanding in the question's phrasing.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** Yes, $qvB$.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** The phrasing "relativistic Lorentz force" is ambiguous and potentially misleading.
*   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions/Variables):** All defined.
*   **Guideline 8 (Units/Notation):** Consistent and correct.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not Multipart):** Yes, single target quantity.
*   **Guideline 10 (Formatting):** Correct LaTeX and tags.

**Actionable Feedback:**
*   **Clarity/Ambiguity:** Rephrase the question to avoid ambiguity regarding "relativistic Lorentz force". If the intent is to test relativistic dynamics, ask for something like the *proper acceleration* or the *rate of change of relativistic momentum* at that instant, which would explicitly involve the $\gamma$ factor. If the intent is just the force in the lab frame, omit "relativistic" from the force description.
*   **Multi-step Reasoning:** To truly force multi-step relativistic reasoning, consider asking for the proper acceleration or the velocity after a given time/distance, which requires integrating the relativistic force equation.

Frame $S'$ moves with a velocity $v = 0.6c$ in the positive $x$ direction relative to frame $S$. Calculate the spacetime interval $s^2$ between events $A$ and $B$. Give your answer in $\mathrm{m^2}$.
</question>
**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Well-modeled.
*   **Guideline 2 (Expected Answer Type):** Correct (numerical with units).
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, requires recalling the definition of the spacetime interval and implicitly understanding its invariance across inertial frames, which allows direct calculation in frame S.
*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** This is a very standard textbook problem.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** Yes.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Good phrasing, no hints.
*   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions/Variables):** All defined.

*   **Guideline 9 (Not Multipart):** Yes, single target quantity.
*   **Guideline 10 (Formatting):** Correct LaTeX and tags.

**Actionable Feedback:**
*   **Uniqueness:** To increase uniqueness, consider asking for something that *does* require Lorentz transformations, such as the coordinates of event B in frame $S'$ *and then* the interval (which would be the same, but the intermediate steps would be different). Or, ask for the type of interval (timelike, spacelike, null) in addition to its value.

*   **Guideline 10 (Formatting):** Correct LaTeX and tags.

**Actionable Feedback:**
*   **Minor:** While standard knowledge, explicitly stating "Assume the electron's rest mass $m_e$ and charge $e$ are known constants" would make it perfectly self-contained.

A parallel plate capacitor is moving at a constant velocity $v=0.6c$ perpendicular to the direction of the electric field created by the capacitor. The plates of the capacitor have a surface charge density of $\sigma = 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C/m^2}$ in its rest frame. Determine the magnitude of the magnetic field observed in a frame moving with the capacitor. Assume the space between the plates is a vacuum. Express your answer in Tesla (T).
</question>
**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Well-modeled.
*   **Guideline 2 (Expected Answer Type):** Correct (numerical with units).
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** As phrased, this is a trick question. "in a frame moving with the capacitor" means in the capacitor's *rest frame*. In its rest frame, the charges are stationary, so the magnetic field is zero. This makes the question trivial and doesn't require relativistic field transformations.
*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** A problem involving relativistic field transformations would be unique. As phrased, it's trivial.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** Yes, $0 \, \mathrm{T}$.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** The phrasing is precise enough to lead to $0$, but if the intent was to test relativistic field transformations, it's misleading.

*   **Guideline 8 (Units/Notation):** Consistent and correct.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not Multipart):** Yes, single target quantity.
*   **Guideline 10 (Formatting):** Correct LaTeX and tags.

**Actionable Feedback:**
*   **Clarity/Intent:** Rephrase the question to ask for the magnetic field observed *in a frame where the capacitor is moving* (e.g., "in the Earth frame" or "by an observer relative to whom the capacitor is moving"). This would transform it into an excellent multi-step problem involving relativistic field transformations.

**Overall Summary and Final Recommendations:**

The set of questions demonstrates a good grasp of formatting, clarity, and basic problem construction. Questions 4, 5, and 6 are particularly strong, excelling in forcing multi-step relativistic reasoning and offering a good level of challenge and uniqueness.

However, the set could be improved by:

1.  **Enhancing Uniqueness:** Many questions (1, 3, 7, 9, 10) are very standard textbook problems. Try to introduce more complex scenarios, combine concepts in novel ways, or ask for quantities that aren't the most direct application of a single formula.
2.  **Improving Multi-Step Reasoning (for all questions):** While many *are* multi-step, some (e.g., 2, 7, 10) are quite direct formula applications. For truly advanced learners, more synthesis and conceptual depth can be integrated.
3.  **Ensuring Thematic Consistency:** Questions 7 and 9 deviate from the apparent special relativity theme of the set.
    *   **Question 7 (Classical E&M):** Replace with a relativistic E&M problem (e.g., field transformations, or the electric field of a uniformly moving charge).
    *   **Question 9 (Classical Lorentz Force):** Modify to explicitly include relativistic effects in the calculation of the radius.
4.  **Refining Ambiguity:** Q2 and Q8 need rephrasing to ensure the intended physics concept is tested rather than leading to a trivial or ambiguous solution.

By addressing these points, the set of questions can become even stronger and more aligned with the stated guidelines for advanced physics assessments.

*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** Good, asking for *proper* acceleration makes it more unique than simply asking for lab-frame acceleration.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** **Fails.** The question is unsolvable as stated. The rest mass ($m_0$) of the particle is required to calculate proper acceleration ($a_0 = F_0/m_0$, where $F_0$ is the force in the instantaneous rest frame, or more generally involves $m_0$).
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing / No Hints):** Phrasing is good, but the missing variable is a critical flaw.
*   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions/Variables Defined):** **Fails.** The particle's rest mass ($m_0$) is not defined or provided, making the question unsolvable for a numerical answer.
*   **Guideline 8 (Units/Notation):** Consistent and conventional, but cannot be calculated without $m_0$.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not Multipart / No Hints):** Single target quantity.
*   **Guideline 10 (LaTeX Formatting):** Correct.

**Feedback for Q2:**
*   **Critical Issue:** The question is unsolvable because the particle's rest mass ($m_0$) is not provided.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Provide the rest mass of the particle (e.g., "A proton with charge $q = 2 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C}$..." or "A particle with rest mass $m_0 = \dots$ and charge $q = \dots$").

**Critique of Question 3:**

```xml
<question>
Two events, $A$ and $B$, occur in spacetime. In frame $S$, event $A$ has coordinates $(ct_A, x_A, y_A, z_A) = (0, 0, 0, 0)$ and event $B$ has coordinates $(ct_B, x_B, y_B, z_B) = (5 \, \mathrm{m}, 3 \, \mathrm{m}, 0, 0)$. Frame $S'$ moves with a velocity $v = 0.6c$ in the positive $x$ direction relative to frame $S$. First, calculate the coordinates of event $B$ in frame $S'$. Then, calculate the spacetime interval $s^2$ between events $A$ and $B$ using the coordinates in frame $S'$. Give your answer in $\mathrm{m^2}$.
</question>
```

*   **Guideline 1 (Model Physics Scenario):** Good. Standard spacetime event transformation.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Correct, numerical value with units.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes. It requires Lorentz transformation and then calculating the spacetime interval.
*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** **Fails.** This is a highly standard, canonical textbook problem for Lorentz transformations and spacetime intervals. It lacks any novelty.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** Yes.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing / No Hints):** Phrasing is clear, but it violates the "not multipart" guideline.
*   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions/Variables Defined):** All defined.
*   **Guideline 8 (Units/Notation):** Consistent and conventional.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not Multipart / No Hints):** **Fails.** This is explicitly a two-part question ("First, calculate... Then, calculate..."). Questions must focus on solving for a single target quantity.
*   **Guideline 10 (LaTeX Formatting):** Correct.

**Feedback for Q3:**
*   **Major Issue (Guideline 9):** The question is multipart. It explicitly asks for two separate calculations.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Reword the question to ask for *only* the final quantity (the spacetime interval $s^2$ calculated in $S'$). For example: "Calculate the spacetime interval $s^2$ between events $A$ and $B$ in frame $S'$." (To solve this, a student *must* first calculate the coordinates of B in $S'$, so it naturally forces the necessary steps without making it multipart).
*   **Improve Uniqueness (Guideline 4):** Consider adding a twist, such as asking about causality or whether the interval is space-like/time-like/light-like, or involving more complex event setups (e.g., three events), though this might complicate the "single quantity" rule. As it stands, it's a very basic textbook problem.

**Critique of Question 4:**

```xml
<question>
An electron moves with a velocity $\vec{v} = (0.9c, 0, 0)$ in a uniform electric field $\vec{E} = (10^6 \, \mathrm{V/m}, 0, 0)$. Calculate the magnitude of the electron's proper acceleration, assuming the electron is only influenced by the electric field and that its initial velocity is along the x-axis. Assume the electron's rest mass $m_e$ and charge $e$ are known constants. Express your answer in $\mathrm{m/s^2}$.
</question>
```

*   **Guideline 1 (Model Physics Scenario):** Good. Relativistic particle motion in an electric field.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Correct, numerical value with units.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Fair. While it involves relativistic concepts, the specific setup (force parallel to velocity) simplifies the proper acceleration calculation to $a_0 = F/m_e = eE/m_e$. This might be seen as less "multi-step" than if the force were perpendicular or at an angle, where field transformations might be more involved for the IRF. However, understanding *why* it simplifies is still a key conceptual step.
*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** Good, asking for proper acceleration is less common than lab-frame acceleration. The parallel alignment simplifies the calculation but doesn't make it trivial if the student understands the underlying concepts.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** Yes.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing / No Hints):** Phrasing is good. "initial velocity is along the x-axis" clarifies that this applies at the instant specified.
*   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions/Variables Defined):** All defined. $m_e$ and $e$ are stated as known constants, which is acceptable.
*   **Guideline 8 (Units/Notation):** Consistent and conventional.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not Multipart / No Hints):** Single target quantity.
*   **Guideline 10 (LaTeX Formatting):** Correct.

**Feedback for Q4:**
*   This is a good question overall. While the solution for proper acceleration is simple due to the parallel alignment, it still tests the conceptual understanding of proper acceleration and its relation to force in the instantaneous rest frame. No major changes needed.

**Critique of Question 5:**

```xml
<question>
A particle with rest mass $m_0$ and charge $q$ is initially at rest in a uniform electric field $\vec{E} = (E, 0, 0)$. Calculate the particle's velocity after it has traveled a distance $x$. Express your answer in terms of $c$, $m_0$, $q$, $E$, and $x$.
</question>
```

*   **Guideline 1 (Model Physics Scenario):** Good. Relativistic work-energy theorem application.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Correct, symbolic expression.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Good. Requires calculating work done, setting it equal to relativistic kinetic energy, and solving for velocity.
*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** **Fails.** This is a highly standard, canonical textbook problem for relativistic work-energy. It lacks any novelty.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** Yes.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing / No Hints):** Phrasing is good.
*   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions/Variables Defined):** All defined.
*   **Guideline 8 (Units/Notation):** Consistent and conventional.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not Multipart / No Hints):** Single target quantity.
*   **Guideline 10 (LaTeX Formatting):** Correct.

**Feedback for Q5:**
*   **Major Issue (Guideline 4):** This is a very common textbook problem.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To make it more unique, consider adding a twist, such as:
    *   The particle having an initial velocity.
    *   The electric field being time-dependent or spatially varying in a non-trivial way.
    *   Asking for the velocity after a certain amount of *time*, which would require integrating the relativistic force equation, significantly increasing complexity.
    *   Introduce a perpendicular magnetic field component for more complex dynamics (though energy would still be derived from $qEx$).

**Critique of Question 6:**

```xml
<question>
A rod of proper length $L_0 = 1 \, \mathrm{m}$ is moving at a velocity $v = 0.8c$ relative to an observer. The rod is oriented at an angle of $60^\circ$ with respect to the direction of motion in its rest frame. What is the observed length of the rod by the observer? Provide the answer in meters.
</question>
```

*   **Guideline 1 (Model Physics Scenario):** Good. Relativistic length contraction for an object oriented at an angle.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Correct, numerical value with units.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Good. Requires breaking down the length into components parallel and perpendicular to motion, applying contraction only to the parallel component, and then recombining them.
*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** Fair. While direct length contraction is standard, an angled rod is a common variation in textbooks, but perhaps less fundamental than the core principle. It's not truly "novel."
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** Yes.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing / No Hints):** Phrasing is good.
*   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions/Variables Defined):** All defined.
*   **Guideline 8 (Units/Notation):** Consistent and conventional.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not Multipart / No Hints):** Single target quantity.
*   **Guideline 10 (LaTeX Formatting):** Correct.

**Feedback for Q6:**
*   **Improve Uniqueness (Guideline 4):** While a good problem, it's a standard textbook variation. To enhance uniqueness, you could combine it with another relativistic effect (e.g., asking about the observed angle of the rod or its perceived shape if the observer also has a velocity).

**Critique of Question 7:**

```xml
<question>
A point charge $q$ is moving with constant velocity $\vec{v} = v\hat{x}$ relative to an observer. Calculate the electric potential $\phi$ at a point P with coordinates $(x, y, 0)$ in the observer's frame. Express your answer in terms of $q$, $v$, $x$, $y$, the vacuum permittivity $\epsilon_0$, and the speed of light $c$.
</question>
```

*   **Guideline 1 (Model Physics Scenario):** Good. Relativistic electric potential of a moving charge.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Correct, symbolic expression.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Good. Requires understanding the Lorentz transformation of potentials or using the specific Liénard-Wiechert potential for constant velocity.
*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** Fair. This is a standard topic in advanced EM/Relativity courses, but less common than the basic SR postulates.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** **Fails.** The question is ambiguous regarding the time. The electric potential of a moving charge is time-dependent. The coordinates $(x,y,0)$ are given, but the time $t$ at which the potential is to be calculated is not specified. The answer will contain $t$ unless a specific instant (e.g., when the charge passes the origin) is specified.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing / No Hints):** **Fails.** Ambiguity regarding time. "at a point P with coordinates $(x,y,0)$" usually implies a specific point *at a specific time*, but the specific time is missing.
*   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions/Variables Defined):** **Fails.** The time variable ($t$) is necessary for the charge's position, and thus the potential, but is not defined as part of the output variables.
*   **Guideline 8 (Units/Notation):** Consistent and conventional.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not Multipart / No Hints):** Single target quantity.
*   **Guideline 10 (LaTeX Formatting):** Correct.

**Feedback for Q7:**
*   **Critical Issue (Guideline 5, 6, 7):** The question is ambiguous about the time at which the potential is to be calculated. The potential of a moving charge is inherently time-dependent.
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   **Option 1 (Common approach):** Specify a reference time. Example: "Calculate the electric potential $\phi$ at a point P with coordinates $(x, y, 0)$ in the observer's frame *at the instant the charge passes the origin $(0,0,0)$*." This would mean $vt=0$ in the formula.
    *   **Option 2 (General case):** Include time as a variable in the answer. Example: "Calculate the electric potential $\phi(x, y, t)$ at a point P with coordinates $(x, y, 0)$ at time $t$ in the observer's frame. Express your answer in terms of $q$, $v$, $x$, $y$, $t$, $\epsilon_0$, and $c$."

<question>
A parallel plate capacitor is moving at a constant velocity $v=0.6c$ perpendicular to the direction of the electric field created by the capacitor relative to an observer. The plates of the capacitor have a surface charge density of $\sigma = 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C/m^2}$ in its rest frame. Determine the magnitude of the magnetic field observed by the observer. Assume the space between the plates is a vacuum. Express your answer in Tesla (T).
</question>
```

*   **Guideline 1 (Model Physics Scenario):** Excellent. Relativistic transformation of fields for a moving capacitor.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Correct, numerical value with units.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Good. Requires calculating the electric field in the rest frame, applying Lorentz transformation rules for fields (noting the perpendicular velocity), and then calculating the magnetic field magnitude. This is a solid multi-step problem.
*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** Good. While field transformations are standard, applying them to a moving capacitor in this specific configuration is less common than basic point charge problems, offering a degree of novelty.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** Yes.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing / No Hints):** Phrasing is good. The orientation ("perpendicular to the direction of the electric field") is clearly stated.
*   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions/Variables Defined):** All defined.
*   **Guideline 8 (Units/Notation):** Consistent and conventional.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not Multipart / No Hints):** Single target quantity.
*   **Guideline 10 (LaTeX Formatting):** Correct.

**Feedback for Q8:**
*   This is an excellent question that adheres to all guidelines. No improvements needed.

Find the radius of the circular path the particle follows in the $xy$-plane in terms of $q$, $B$, $m$, $v_x$, and $v_y$, accounting for relativistic effects.

```

*   **Guideline 1 (Model Physics Scenario):** Good. Relativistic cyclotron motion.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Correct, symbolic expression.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Good. Requires calculating the magnitude of velocity, Lorentz factor, relativistic momentum, and equating Lorentz force to the centripetal force using relativistic momentum.
*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** **Fails.** This is a highly standard, canonical textbook problem for relativistic cyclotron radius. It lacks any novelty.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** Yes.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing / No Hints):** Phrasing is good.
*   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions/Variables Defined):** All defined.
*   **Guideline 8 (Units/Notation):** Consistent and conventional.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not Multipart / No Hints):** Single target quantity.
*   **Guideline 10 (LaTeX Formatting):** Correct.

**Feedback for Q9:**
*   **Major Issue (Guideline 4):** This is a very common textbook problem.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To make it more unique, consider:
    *   Adding an electric field component perpendicular to the magnetic field (e.g., a velocity selector setup).
    *   Asking for the pitch of a helical path if there's a velocity component parallel to the B-field.
    *   Asking about the energy required to reach a certain radius.

<question>
A light source emits photons with a frequency of $5 \times 10^{14} \, \mathrm{Hz}$ in its rest frame. The source is moving at a speed of $0.7c$ relative to an observer.

*   **Guideline 1 (Model Physics Scenario):** Good. Relativistic Doppler effect with angular dependence.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Correct, numerical value with units.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Good. Requires identifying and correctly applying the full relativistic Doppler shift formula for a general angle.
*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** Fair. While the general Doppler effect is standard, the angular dependence makes it a more involved (but still standard) application than simple longitudinal or transverse Doppler shift. It's not truly "novel."
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** Yes.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing / No Hints):** Phrasing is good. The angle definition is clear.

**Feedback for Q10:**
*   **Improve Uniqueness (Guideline 4):** This is a standard textbook problem. While a good test of the formula, consider adding a more complex scenario, perhaps involving two sources or multiple observers, or a combination with other relativistic effects if possible while maintaining the single-quantity target.

**Overall Summary and General Recommendations:**

The questions are generally well-formatted, use correct LaTeX and units, and aim for multi-step reasoning. However, there are consistent issues with **Guideline 4 (Be Unique)** and critical errors in **Guideline 5 (Single Solution)** and **Guideline 9 (Not Multipart)** for specific questions.

**Key areas for improvement:**

1.  **Address Unsolvable Questions:** Immediately fix Q2 (missing mass) and Q7 (ambiguous time).
2.  **Eliminate Multipart Questions:** Q3 must be rephrased to ask for only one target quantity.
3.  **Enhance Uniqueness:** This is the most prevalent area for improvement. Many questions are direct applications of standard textbook formulas (Q3, Q5, Q6, Q9, Q10). To meet the "Be Unique" guideline, consider:
    *   **Combining Principles:** Design scenarios that require the simultaneous application of two or more *different* relativistic effects or a relativistic effect combined with another physics domain (e.g., thermodynamics, optics, quantum mechanics in a relativistic context, if appropriate for the level).
    *   **Reverse Problems:** Ask for an input parameter given an observed outcome.
    *   **Comparative Scenarios:** Compare observations from multiple observers or different configurations.
    *   **Non-Standard Geometries/Motions:** Beyond simple linear motion or perpendicular/parallel fields, explore more complex arrangements that require careful vector analysis.
    *   **Graphical Interpretation:** While not directly asked for here, the underlying scenarios could lead to more complex derivations or interpretations.
    *   **Conceptual Depth:** Frame questions that require deeper conceptual understanding rather than just formula application.

By addressing these points, the questions will become more challenging, unique, and better aligned with the "assessment expert" standard.
