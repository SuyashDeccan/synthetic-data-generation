A sample of paramagnetic material with $N$ non-interacting heavy quarks, each with spin $S = \frac{1}{2}$ and magnetic moment $\mu$, is placed in a uniform external magnetic field $\vec{B} = B_0 \hat{z}$ at temperature $T$. The system is initially in thermal equilibrium. At time $t = 0$, the magnetic field is rapidly increased to $\vec{B'} = 2B_0 \hat{z}$. Assuming the spin relaxation time is given by $\tau$, calculate the rate of change of the average z-component of the spin angular momentum, $\frac{d\langle S_z \rangle}{dt}$, immediately after the field change (at $t = 0^+$), in terms of $N$, $\mu$, $B_0$, $T$, $\tau$, and fundamental constants. Assume that the temperature $T$ remains constant and that the system can be treated within the high-temperature limit (i.e., $\mu B_0 \ll k_B T$).

Consider a system of $N$ non-interacting, identical heavy quarks in a magnetic field $\vec{B}=B_0\hat{z}$. Each heavy quark has a magnetic moment $\vec{\mu} = g\mu_B \vec{S}/\hbar$, where $g$ is the g-factor, $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, and $\vec{S}$ is the spin operator. At time $t=0$, all the spins are aligned along the x-axis, i.e., $\langle S_x \rangle = S$ and $\langle S_y \rangle = \langle S_z \rangle = 0$, where $S$ is the magnitude of the spin. The system experiences spin damping with a characteristic time $\tau$. Calculate the value of $\langle S_x \rangle$ at time $t=\tau$, assuming that the spin polarization precesses around the z-axis while simultaneously decaying exponentially due to damping.

A magnetic material with a complex magnetic susceptibility $\chi(\omega) = \chi'(\omega) - i\chi''(\omega)$ is subjected to an alternating magnetic field $H(t) = H_0 \cos(\omega t)$. The energy dissipation per unit volume per cycle due to hysteresis losses is given by $W = \pi \mu_0 \chi''(\omega) H_0^2$, where $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space. Suppose the imaginary part of the susceptibility follows the Debye relaxation model: $\chi''(\omega) = \frac{\chi_0 \omega \tau}{1 + (\omega \tau)^2}$, where $\chi_0$ is the static susceptibility and $\tau$ is the relaxation time.

Assume that the temperature $T$ remains constant and that the system can be treated within the high-temperature limit (i.e., $\mu B_0 \ll k_B T$).
</question>

**Critique:**
This is a well-designed question that adheres closely to the guidelines.
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a Physics Scenario):** Excellent. It presents a clear, physically plausible scenario involving thermal equilibrium, a sudden perturbation, and relaxation.
*   **Guideline 2 (Expected Answer):** Correctly asks for a symbolic expression.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, it requires calculating initial and final equilibrium states, and then applying a relaxation model, demonstrating multi-step reasoning.
*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** The specific setup (initial rate after rapid field change) makes it a good, non-trivial application of relaxation theory.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** Yes, there is a unique symbolic solution.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing / No Hints):** Phrasing is clear and professional. No obvious hints are given.
*   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions & Variables):** All assumptions are clearly stated and variables defined.
*   **Guideline 8 (Consistent Units & Notation):** Notation is standard.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not Multipart):** Single target quantity.
*   **Guideline 10 (Question Formatting):** Excellent use of LaTeX for inline math, numbers, and variables. Correctly wrapped in `<question>` tags.

**Actionable Feedback:**
No significant improvements needed. The use of "heavy quarks" is a stylistic choice and acceptable for an idealized scenario.

<question>
A spherical nanoparticle of a ferromagnetic material with radius $r = 10 \, \mathrm{nm}$ and saturation magnetization $M_s = 8 \times 10^5 \, \mathrm{A/m}$ is subjected to an oscillating magnetic field $B(t) = B_0 \cos(\omega t)$ along the z-axis, where $B_0 = 0.1 \, \mathrm{T}$ and $\omega = 10^9 \, \mathrm{rad/s}$. The nanoparticle has a uniaxial anisotropy with anisotropy constant $K = 10^4 \, \mathrm{J/m^3}$. The Landau-Lifshitz damping parameter is $\alpha = 0.02$. Assuming that the effective magnetic field is given by $H_{eff} = H_{applied} + H_{anisotropy}$, calculate the average power absorbed by the nanoparticle due to the magnetic field over one period of the oscillation, $\langle P \rangle$, due to the damping. Express your answer in Watts.
</question>

**Critique:**
This question presents a complex and potentially ambiguous scenario.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** **Fails.** The crucial information regarding the *direction* of the uniaxial anisotropy axis relative to the applied field is missing. Without this, the form of $H_{anisotropy}$ in the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation cannot be uniquely determined, making the problem unsolvable for a single answer. For example, if the anisotropy is along z, it behaves differently than if it's along x or a general direction.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing / No Hints):** The statement "Assuming that the effective magnetic field is given by $H_{eff} = H_{applied} + H_{anisotropy}$" is incomplete without defining how $H_{anisotropy}$ is derived or its directional dependence for a uniaxial anisotropy.
*   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions & Variables):** Missing the definition of the anisotropy axis direction.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Crucially, specify the direction of the uniaxial anisotropy axis.** For example, "The nanoparticle has a uniaxial anisotropy along the z-axis (or x-axis, or perpendicular to the applied field) with anisotropy constant $K = 10^4 \, \mathrm{J/m^3}$." This is essential for a unique solution.
2.  **Clarify the expected level of solution.** Solving the LLG equation with anisotropy for average power can be very complex analytically. If a simpler analytical solution is expected (e.g., small angle approximation, specific model for $\chi''$), the question might need to implicitly or explicitly guide towards it (though explicit guidance violates "no hints," a simpler setup would be better). For example, if the anisotropy axis is aligned with the applied field, the problem simplifies significantly.

<question>
Consider a system of $N$ non-interacting, identical heavy quarks in a magnetic field $\vec{B}=B_0\hat{z}$. Each heavy quark has a magnetic moment $\vec{\mu} = g\mu_B \vec{S}/\hbar$, where $g$ is the g-factor, $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, and $\vec{S}$ is the spin operator. At time $t=0$, all the spins are aligned along the x-axis, i.e., $\langle S_x \rangle = S$ and $\langle S_y \rangle = \langle S_z \rangle = 0$, where $S$ is the magnitude of the spin. The system experiences spin damping with a characteristic time $\tau$. Calculate the value of $\langle S_x \rangle$ at time $t=\tau$, assuming that the spin polarization precesses around the z-axis while simultaneously decaying exponentially due to damping.
</question>

**Critique:**
This question suffers from significant ambiguities and a hint.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** **Fails.**
    *   The initial condition "$ \langle S_x \rangle = S $, where $S$ is the magnitude of the spin" is ambiguous for a spin $S=1/2$ particle. The magnitude of the spin operator is $|\vec{S}| = \sqrt{S(S+1)}\hbar = \sqrt{3}/2 \hbar$. However, $\langle S_x \rangle$ cannot be $\sqrt{3}/2 \hbar$ for a spin-1/2 particle; its maximum expectation value is $\hbar/2$. This needs to be clarified, likely meaning $\langle S_x \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\hbar$ for a fully polarized state.
    *   The question does not specify the units for the final answer of $\langle S_x \rangle$.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing / No Hints):** **Fails.** The sentence "assuming that the spin polarization precesses around the z-axis while simultaneously decaying exponentially due to damping" is a direct hint about the mathematical form of the solution, violating the "no hints" rule. Students should derive this behavior from the physical principles.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Remove the hint:** Delete the sentence "assuming that the spin polarization precesses around the z-axis while simultaneously decaying exponentially due to damping."
2.  **Clarify the initial spin polarization magnitude:** Rephrase the initial condition for $\langle S_x \rangle$. For a spin $S=1/2$ system, state it as, for example: "At time $t=0$, the average spin polarization is entirely along the x-axis, such that $\langle S_x \rangle = \hbar/2$ and $\langle S_y \rangle = \langle S_z \rangle = 0$."
3.  **Specify units for the answer:** Add a phrase like "Express your answer in units of $\hbar$." or "Express your answer in SI units."

<question>
A magnetic material with a complex magnetic susceptibility $\chi(\omega) = \chi'(\omega) - i\chi''(\omega)$ is subjected to an alternating magnetic field $H(t) = H_0 \cos(\omega t)$. The energy dissipation per unit volume per cycle due to hysteresis losses is given by $W = \pi \mu_0 \chi''(\omega) H_0^2$, where $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space. Suppose the imaginary part of the susceptibility follows the Debye relaxation model: $\chi''(\omega) = \frac{\chi_0 \omega \tau}{1 + (\omega \tau)^2}$, where $\chi_0$ is the static susceptibility and $\tau$ is the relaxation time. Find the frequency $\omega_{max}$ at which the energy dissipation $W$ is maximized, and express your answer in terms of $\tau$.
</question>

**Critique:**
This is a generally solid question.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing / No Hints):** **Borderline pass/fail.** Providing the exact formula for $W = \pi \mu_0 \chi''(\omega) H_0^2$ could be considered a hint, as it reduces the problem to a purely mathematical optimization once the Debye model for $\chi''$ is also given. For advanced learners, this formula might be expected knowledge or derivable. If the intent is to test the application of the Debye model and calculus, it's acceptable. However, for strict adherence to "no hints," it simplifies a fundamental physical relationship.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Consider removing the explicit formula for $W$.** If students are expected to know or derive the relationship between energy dissipation, $\chi''$, and $H_0$, then stating the formula makes the problem less challenging. An alternative phrasing could be: "The energy dissipation per unit volume per cycle is directly proportional to the imaginary part of the susceptibility, $\chi''(\omega)$, and the square of the applied field amplitude." This still guides them without giving the exact proportionality constant. If the proportionality constant is intended to be provided, acknowledge it clearly.

<question>
A sample contains $N = 10^{20}$ heavy quarks, each with spin $S = 1/2$. The sample is placed in a magnetic field $B = 1 \, \mathrm{T}$ along the z-axis. Due to spin-orbit coupling, the quarks experience a damping force proportional to their velocity. The spin relaxation time is measured to be $\tau = 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{s}$. Assuming that the initial spin polarization is along the x-axis, what is the magnitude of the y-component of the average spin polarization vector $\langle S_y(t) \rangle$ at time $t = \tau/2$? Assume that the spin polarization decays exponentially with time and precesses around the z-axis with Larmor frequency $\omega_L = g \mu_B B / \hbar$, where $g=2$ and $\mu_B = 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \mathrm{J/T}$. Give your answer in units of $\hbar$.
</question>

**Critique:**
This question has several significant flaws, very similar to Question 3.
*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** **Fails.** This question is almost identical in structure and required concepts to Question 3, just with numerical values and asking for $\langle S_y \rangle$ instead of $\langle S_x \rangle$. It's redundant if both are present.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** **Fails.** The initial magnitude of the spin polarization is not specified. "initial spin polarization is along the x-axis" is insufficient. For a spin-1/2 particle, it's typically $\langle S_x(0) \rangle = \hbar/2$. This makes the problem unsolvable without an implicit assumption.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing / No Hints):** **Fails.**
    *   The sentence "Assume that the spin polarization decays exponentially with time and precesses around the z-axis with Larmor frequency $\omega_L = g \mu_B B / \hbar$" is a significant hint, providing both the form of the solution and the Larmor frequency formula. This violates the "no hints" rule.
    *   The statement "Due to spin-orbit coupling, the quarks experience a damping force proportional to their velocity" is physically inaccurate for spin relaxation. Spin relaxation is typically characterized by a decay time $\tau$ due to interactions like spin-lattice coupling, not a velocity-dependent damping force in the classical sense.
*   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions & Variables):** Missing the explicit initial spin polarization magnitude. It is also ambiguous whether $\langle S_y(t) \rangle$ refers to the per-quark average or the total for $N$ quarks. The number $N$ is provided but may not be used depending on interpretation.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Remove the hint:** Delete the sentence "Assume that the spin polarization decays exponentially with time and precesses around the z-axis with Larmor frequency $\omega_L = g \mu_B B / \hbar$." The student should be expected to know these concepts.
2.  **Specify initial polarization magnitude:** Clarify the initial magnitude. For example: "Assuming that the initial average spin polarization *per quark* is $\langle s_x(0) \rangle = \hbar/2$ along the x-axis..."
3.  **Clarify the target quantity:** Specify if the answer required is the average spin *per quark* (e.g., $\langle s_y(t) \rangle$) or the total spin of the sample ($N \langle s_y(t) \rangle$). If $N$ is not to be used, remove $N=10^{20}$.
4.  **Correct the physical description of damping:** Rephrase "Due to spin-orbit coupling, the quarks experience a damping force proportional to their velocity." to a more accurate physical statement or simply state "The system experiences spin damping with a characteristic time $\tau$." as the origin is not crucial for the calculation.
5.  **Address uniqueness/redundancy:** As this question is very similar to Question 3, consider keeping only one of them and refining it. If both are to be kept, ensure they test distinctly different aspects or require different solution approaches.

*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Excellent. Expects a symbolic expression.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Excellent. Requires calculating initial thermal equilibrium magnetization, understanding the effect of a sudden field change, and applying a relaxation model (e.g., Bloch equations or a simple relaxation towards a new equilibrium).
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Good. While elements are standard, the combination of a sudden field change and requesting the *initial rate of change* of total spin angular momentum is a good variation.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Excellent. Should yield a unique symbolic solution.

*   **Guideline 9 (Units & Notation):** Good. Notation is consistent. One minor clarification: $\langle S_z \rangle$ is commonly used for the average *total* z-component of spin angular momentum for $N$ particles, consistent with $N$ being a parameter.

A spherical nanoparticle of a ferromagnetic material with radius $r = 10 \, \mathrm{nm}$ and saturation magnetization $M_s = 8 \times 10^5 \, \mathrm{A/m}$ is subjected to an oscillating magnetic field $B(t) = B_0 \cos(\omega t)$ along the z-axis, where $B_0 = 0.1 \, \mathrm{T}$ and $\omega = 10^9 \, \mathrm{rad/s}$. The nanoparticle has a uniaxial anisotropy along the z-axis with anisotropy constant $K = 10^4 \, \mathrm{J/m^3}$. The Landau-Lifshitz damping parameter is $\alpha = 0.02$. Assuming that the effective magnetic field is given by $H_{eff} = H_{applied} + H_{anisotropy}$, calculate the average power absorbed by the nanoparticle due to the magnetic field over one period of the oscillation, $\langle P \rangle$, due to the damping. Express your answer in Watts.
</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model Physics Scenario):** Excellent. Models a realistic scenario in nanomagnetism involving oscillating fields, anisotropy, and damping.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Excellent. Expects a numerical value with SI units.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Excellent. Requires understanding of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, effective fields, and power absorption calculation.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Good. This is a specific application of LLG and energy dissipation in a nanoparticle, which feels unique enough.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Good, assuming sufficient information is provided.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing & No Hints):** Needs improvement.
    *   "Assuming that the effective magnetic field is given by $H_{eff} = H_{applied} + H_{anisotropy}$" is a significant hint. For advanced learners, this should ideally be part of their expected knowledge in formulating the LLG equation, or they should be able to derive or look up the general form of effective field.
*   **Guideline 8 (Assumptions & Variables Defined):** Needs significant improvement.
    *   The crucial component $H_{anisotropy}$ is *not* defined in terms of $K$ or how it should be calculated. While $K$ is given, a student cannot directly calculate $H_{anisotropy}$ from $K$ and $M_s$ without knowing the specific form for uniaxial anisotropy (e.g., $H_{anisotropy} = (2K/M_s) \cos\theta \sin\theta \hat{\theta}$ or a simpler approximation for the *z-axis* anisotropy). This missing piece of information makes the problem *unsolvable* as stated.
    *   Other implicit assumptions (e.g., single-domain nanoparticle, coherent magnetization rotation, no thermal fluctuations, etc.) are common in such problems but not explicitly stated.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units & Notation):** Excellent. All units and notation are consistent and conventional.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not Multipart & No Hints):** Needs improvement due to the hint (as noted in G7).
*   **Guideline 11 (LaTeX Formatting):** Excellent. All formatting is correct.

**Overall Feedback:** This question has strong potential but is currently **unsolvable** due to missing a crucial definition/formula for $H_{anisotropy}$ and provides a hint that simplifies the problem for advanced learners.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Define $H_{anisotropy}$:** Explicitly state the form of the anisotropy field (e.g., $H_{anisotropy} = (2K/M_s) \hat{z}$ or specify that the anisotropy prefers the z-axis and the field is given by its derivative of energy). For a full LLG problem, $H_{anisotropy}$ depends on the magnetization direction.
2.  **Remove Hint:** Remove the phrase "Assuming that the effective magnetic field is given by $H_{eff} = H_{applied} + H_{anisotropy}$". Students should be expected to assemble the effective field for LLG.
3.  **Clarify Assumptions:** Consider adding assumptions like "assume the nanoparticle behaves as a single domain particle".

Consider a system of $N$ non-interacting, identical heavy quarks with spin $S = \frac{1}{2}$ in a magnetic field $\vec{B}=B_0\hat{z}$.

1.  **Increase Uniqueness:** To make it more unique, consider adding a twist, like a time-varying magnetic field component, a different damping model, or a specific interaction (e.g., hyperfine interaction) that might lead to dephasing *in addition* to damping.

<question>
A magnetic material with a complex magnetic susceptibility $\chi(\omega) = \chi'(\omega) - i\chi''(\omega)$ is subjected to an alternating magnetic field $H(t) = H_0 \cos(\omega t)$. The energy dissipation per unit volume per cycle is directly proportional to the imaginary part of the susceptibility, $\chi''(\omega)$, and the square of the applied field amplitude. Suppose the imaginary part of the susceptibility follows the Debye relaxation model: $\chi''(\omega) = \frac{\chi_0 \omega \tau}{1 + (\omega \tau)^2}$, where $\chi_0$ is the static susceptibility and $\tau$ is the relaxation time. Find the frequency $\omega_{max}$ at which the energy dissipation is maximized, and express your answer in terms of $\tau$.
</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model Physics Scenario):** Excellent. Clear scenario involving complex susceptibility and energy dissipation.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Excellent. Expects a symbolic expression.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Good. Requires understanding complex susceptibility and then finding the maximum of a function, which is a mathematical step. The physical principle is mostly given.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Needs improvement. This is a very standard problem from materials science or condensed matter physics, specifically asking to find the peak of a Debye relaxation curve. It's a common textbook example.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Excellent. Should yield a unique symbolic solution.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing & No Hints):** Needs improvement.
    *   "The energy dissipation per unit volume per cycle is directly proportional to the imaginary part of the susceptibility, $\chi''(\omega)$, and the square of the applied field amplitude." This is a significant hint. For advanced learners, deriving or recalling this relationship for energy dissipation from a complex susceptibility is a key part of the physics. Giving it upfront reduces the problem to a calculus exercise.
*   **Guideline 8 (Assumptions & Variables Defined):** Excellent. All variables are defined, and the Debye relaxation model is specified.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units & Notation):** Excellent. All units and notation are consistent and conventional.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not Multipart & No Hints):** Needs improvement due to the hint (as noted in G7).
*   **Guideline 11 (LaTeX Formatting):** Excellent. All formatting is correct.

**Overall Feedback:** A clear question but it provides a significant hint and is a very standard problem.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Remove Hint:** Remove the sentence "The energy dissipation per unit volume per cycle is directly proportional to the imaginary part of the susceptibility, $\chi''(\omega)$, and the square of the applied field amplitude." Let the student recall or derive this relationship.
2.  **Increase Uniqueness:** Consider a more complex frequency dependence or a scenario involving multiple relaxation times, or perhaps ask for something other than the peak of a standard model.

A sample contains $N = 10^{20}$ heavy quarks, each with spin $S = 1/2$. The sample is placed in a magnetic field $B = 1 \, \mathrm{T}$ along the z-axis. The system experiences spin damping with a characteristic time $\tau = 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{s}$. Assuming that the initial average spin polarization *per quark* is $\langle s_x(0) \rangle = \hbar/2$ along the x-axis, what is the magnitude of the y-component of the average spin polarization vector *per quark*, $\langle s_y(t) \rangle$, at time $t = \tau/2$? The Larmor frequency is given by $\omega_L = g \mu_B B / \hbar$, where $g=2$ and $\mu_B = 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \mathrm{J/T}$. Give your answer in units of $\hbar$.

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model Physics Scenario):** Excellent. Clear scenario of spin precession and damping.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Excellent. Expects a numerical value in specific units.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Excellent. Requires understanding of Larmor precession and exponential damping. It's essentially an application of the Bloch equations.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Poor**. This question is almost identical in its physical setup and core concepts to Question 3. It simply changes the target component ($\langle s_y \rangle$ instead of $\langle s_x \rangle$), provides numerical values instead of asking for a symbolic expression, and defines the Larmor frequency. This significantly violates the "Be Unique" guideline.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Excellent. Should yield a unique numerical solution.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing & No Hints):** Good. Phrasing is clear. Providing the Larmor frequency formula is more a definition for advanced learners, but it could be argued as a minor hint since they should know it. However, it's explicitly given so it follows G8.
*   **Guideline 8 (Assumptions & Variables Defined):** Excellent. All numerical values and parameters are defined. Assumptions (spin damping time, initial polarization) are stated.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units & Notation):** Excellent. Notation ($\langle s_y(t) \rangle$ for per quark) and units are consistent.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not Multipart & No Hints):** Excellent. Single target quantity, and the Larmor frequency definition is clearly stated.
*   **Guideline 11 (LaTeX Formatting):** Excellent. All formatting is correct.

**Overall Feedback:** This question is well-posed technically but suffers heavily from a lack of originality, being very similar to Question 3.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Increase Uniqueness:** This question needs significant revision to be distinct from Question 3. Introduce a new physical principle, a different type of interaction, or a more complex scenario (e.g., non-uniform field, interaction with a lattice, temperature effects beyond high-T limit, different initial conditions, measuring a different quantity). The numerical values do not make it sufficiently unique.

<question>
A long, thin cylindrical paramagnetic salt with $N$ weakly interacting ions, each with spin $S = \frac{1}{2}$ and magnetic moment $\mu$, is placed inside a superconducting solenoid. Initially, the solenoid produces a uniform magnetic field $\vec{B} = B_0 \hat{z}$ at temperature $T$. The system is in thermal equilibrium, with $k_B T \gg \mu B_0$. The current in the solenoid is then *slowly* reduced to zero over a time $t_0$, effectively demagnetizing the salt *adiabatically*. Assuming that the heat capacity of the lattice is negligible compared to the spin system, calculate the final temperature $T_f$ of the salt after the demagnetization process, in terms of $N$, $\mu$, $B_0$, $T$, $t_0$, and fundamental constants. You may approximate the magnetization as $M \approx \frac{N \mu^2 B}{k_B T}$.

A spherical nanoparticle of a ferromagnetic material with radius $r = 10 \, \mathrm{nm}$ and saturation magnetization $M_s = 8 \times 10^5 \, \mathrm{A/m}$ is subjected to an oscillating magnetic field $B(t) = B_0 \cos(\omega t)$ along the z-axis, where $B_0 = 0.1 \, \mathrm{T}$ and $\omega = 10^9 \, \mathrm{rad/s}$. The nanoparticle has a uniaxial anisotropy along the z-axis with anisotropy constant $K = 10^4 \, \mathrm{J/m^3}$. The Landau-Lifshitz damping parameter is $\alpha = 0.02$. The anisotropy energy density is given by $E_a = K \sin^2{\theta}$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the magnetization and the z-axis.  Calculate the average power absorbed by the nanoparticle due to the magnetic field over one period of the oscillation, $\langle P \rangle$, due to the damping. Assume the nanoparticle behaves as a single domain particle, and express your answer in Watts.

Consider a system of $N$ non-interacting, identical heavy quarks with spin $S = \frac{1}{2}$ in a magnetic field $\vec{B}=B_0\hat{z}$. Each heavy quark has a magnetic moment $\vec{\mu} = g\mu_B \vec{S}/\hbar$, where $g$ is the g-factor, $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, and $\vec{S}$ is the spin operator. At time $t=0$, the average spin polarization *per quark* is entirely along the x-axis, such that $\langle s_x \rangle = \hbar/2$ and $\langle s_y \rangle = \langle s_z \rangle = 0$. The system experiences spin damping with a characteristic time $\tau$.  A small oscillating magnetic field $B_1(t) = B_1 \cos(\omega t)$ is applied along the y-axis, where $\omega = g\mu_B B_0 / \hbar$ (i.e., the Larmor frequency). Calculate the *steady-state* value of $\langle s_y \rangle$ *per quark* after a long time ($t \gg \tau$), assuming $B_1 \ll B_0$. Express your answer in units of $\hbar$, and assume that the spin system reaches a steady state where the time derivative of $\langle s_y \rangle$ is zero.

A magnetic material with a complex magnetic susceptibility $\chi(\omega) = \chi'(\omega) - i\chi''(\omega)$ is subjected to an alternating magnetic field $H(t) = H_0 \cos(\omega t)$. The real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility are related by the Kramers-Kronig relations. Suppose the real part of the susceptibility follows the form $\chi'(\omega) = \frac{\chi_0}{1 + (\omega \tau)^2}$, where $\chi_0$ is the static susceptibility and $\tau$ is the relaxation time.  Assuming causality and linearity, find the expression for the *imaginary* part of the susceptibility, $\chi''(\omega)$, that corresponds to this given $\chi'(\omega)$. Express your answer in terms of $\chi_0$, $\omega$, and $\tau$.
