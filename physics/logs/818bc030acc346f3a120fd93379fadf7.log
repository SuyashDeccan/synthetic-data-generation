**Question 1 Critique:**

`<question>A radially polarized beam with a wavelength of $\lambda = 800 \, \mathrm{nm}$ is focused by an aplanatic lens with a numerical aperture of $NA = 0.95$. The beam's initial intensity profile before focusing is described by a Gaussian function with a waist of $w_0 = 5 \, \mathrm{mm}$. After passing through a spiral phase plate, the beam acquires a topological charge of $l=1$. Assume the electric field can be expressed as $E(r, \phi, z) = A(r,z) e^{i l \phi}$, where $r$ and $\phi$ are the radial and azimuthal coordinates respectively. Calculate the radius (in meters) of the resulting doughnut-shaped intensity profile at the focal plane ($z=0$), defining the radius as the distance from the optical axis to the point of maximum intensity. Assume the intensity is proportional to the square of the electric field amplitude and ignore any diffraction effects beyond the paraxial approximation.</question>`

**Critique:**
*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** Yes, it models a relevant advanced optics scenario.
*   **2. Expect answers as symbolic or numerical:** Numerical, with units. Good.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes, requires understanding optical vortices, their intensity profile, and relating focal spot size to NA.
*   **4. Be Unique:** Yes, it's a specific and somewhat novel combination.
*   **5. Single Solution:** Yes, assuming a standard interpretation.
*   **6. Rigorous, Concise Phrasing:** Generally good, but contains strong hints.
*   **7. All assumptions clearly stated, all variables defined:** Yes.
*   **8. Units consistent, symbols conventional:** Yes.
*   **9. Not multipart:** Single quantity.
*   **10. Question Formatting:** Correct.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Resolve Inconsistency/Hint:** The combination of "aplanatic lens with $NA = 0.95$" (implying high-NA, vectorial diffraction) and "ignore any diffraction effects beyond the paraxial approximation" (implying simple Gaussian beam optics) is contradictory. For high NA, a radially polarized beam forms a doughnut even for $l=0$ due to the longitudinal component. By forcing the paraxial approximation, the question essentially negates the complexities of the radially polarized beam and high NA, reducing it to a standard Laguerre-Gaussian mode problem. The assumption "$E(r, \phi, z) = A(r,z) e^{i l \phi}$" is a very strong hint, effectively telling the student to use a Laguerre-Gaussian ($LG_{01}$) model. To improve, either:
    *   Embrace the high-NA vectorial diffraction (making it much harder, likely requiring pre-derived formulas) or
    *   Simplify the lens/NA description to be strictly paraxial (e.g., "focused to a Gaussian waist of $w_f = X$") and remove the mention of "radially polarized" if its unique high-NA behavior is not intended to be tested. If the intent is to test $LG_{01}$ vortex properties, rephrase to "a Gaussian beam is converted into a first-order optical vortex ($LG_{01}$) beam..."

**Question 2 Critique:**

`<question>A radially chirped Gaussian beam with a central wavelength of $\lambda_0 = 1064 \, \mathrm{nm}$ and a pulse duration of $\tau_0 = 100 \, \mathrm{fs}$ (full width at half maximum) is generated. The beam's radial chirp is such that the wavelength varies linearly with the radial distance $r$ from the beam's center, described by $\lambda(r) = \lambda_0 + \alpha r$, where $\alpha = 1 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{m}^{-1}$. The initial beam waist (radius at $1/e^2$ intensity) is $w_0 = 2 \, \mathrm{mm}$. This beam is then propagated through free space. Assuming the propagation is governed by the paraxial wave equation and ignoring any nonlinear effects, calculate the distance (in meters) from the initial beam plane at which the on-axis pulse duration is minimized due to the radial chirp. Assume the minimization occurs when the spatial chirp compensates for the initial temporal pulse duration.</question>`

**Critique:**
*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** Yes, attempts a novel scenario.
*   **2. Expect answers as symbolic or numerical:** Numerical, with units. Good.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Intended, but the core physical mechanism is unclear.
*   **4. Be Unique:** Yes, it is unique.
*   **5. Single Solution:** Unlikely due to ambiguity.
*   **6. Rigorous, Concise Phrasing:** No, the core premise is physically ambiguous/unclear.
*   **7. All assumptions clearly stated, all variables defined:** Yes, variables are defined. The critical assumption is stated but its physical meaning in free space is problematic.
*   **8. Units consistent, symbols conventional:** Yes.
*   **9. Not multipart:** Single quantity.
*   **10. Question Formatting:** Correct.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Clarify Physical Mechanism:** The premise that "on-axis pulse duration is minimized due to the radial chirp" in *free space* is physically questionable. Radial chirp primarily leads to a spatially varying spectrum. As the beam propagates and diverges, light from different radial (and thus spectral) parts arrives on-axis, which would generally *broaden* the on-axis spectrum and thus the pulse duration, not minimize it, unless specific temporal focusing or dispersion compensation optics are involved. The statement "Assume the minimization occurs when the spatial chirp compensates for the initial temporal pulse duration" is a critical hint/assumption but does not correspond to a standard free-space pulse compression phenomenon. This question is based on a concept that is either missing critical context (e.g., a lens, or a specific dispersive element) or is physically misapplied for free-space propagation. It needs a clear, physically sound model.
2.  **Provide Necessary Context/Equations:** If this problem is based on a specific, non-obvious phenomenon related to spatiotemporal coupling, the underlying principle or relevant formula must be provided or sufficiently detailed for a unique solution.

**Question 3 Critique:**

`<question>A linearly polarized Gaussian pulse with a central wavelength of $\lambda = 800 \, \mathrm{nm}$ and a pulse duration of $\tau = 50 \, \mathrm{fs}$ is incident on a gas jet with a plasma frequency $\omega_p = 2 \times 10^{15} \, \mathrm{rad/s}$. Assume the interaction is in the underdense regime ($\omega_p < \omega$, where $\omega$ is the laser frequency), and the plasma is created instantaneously at the peak of the pulse. Calculate the refractive index experienced by the laser pulse as it propagates through the plasma. Give your answer to five decimal places.</question>`

**Critique:**
*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** Yes, relevant to laser-plasma interaction.
*   **2. Expect answers as symbolic or numerical:** Numerical, with units and precision. Good.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes, requires calculating laser frequency from wavelength, then using the plasma refractive index formula.
*   **4. Be Unique:** While the formula is standard, the specific application is well-posed.
*   **5. Single Solution:** Yes, direct calculation.
*   **6. Rigorous, Concise Phrasing:** Good. No hints.
*   **7. All assumptions clearly stated, all variables defined:** Yes.
*   **8. Units consistent, symbols conventional:** Yes.
*   **9. Not multipart:** Single quantity.
*   **10. Question Formatting:** Correct.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Remove Distractor (Optional):** The pulse duration ($\tau = 50 \, \mathrm{fs}$) is irrelevant to calculating the refractive index for a plasma given its frequency and the laser's central frequency. While including distractors can test critical thinking, for a question specifically asking for a direct calculation of refractive index, it doesn't add to the multi-step reasoning. Consider removing it or integrating it into a more complex problem (e.g., asking about group velocity dispersion, or the pulse's propagation after some distance).

**Question 4 Critique:**

`<question>A radially polarized beam is formed by interfering two linearly polarized beams with orthogonal polarizations and a $\pi/2$ phase difference. The initial beams have Gaussian profiles with waists $w_0 = 1 \, \mathrm{mm}$ at $\lambda = 532 \, \mathrm{nm}$ wavelength and are focused by an ideal lens with focal length $f = 10 \, \mathrm{cm}$. After the lens, the beam is focused onto a metal surface, where it generates an ablation spot. Assume the ablation threshold is reached when the intensity at the focal point exceeds $I_{th} = 1 \times 10^{12} \, \mathrm{W/m^2}$. If the total power of the radially polarized beam is $P = 1 \, \mathrm{W}$, determine the radius (in micrometers) of the expected ablation spot assuming the intensity profile at the focal point is approximately a doughnut shape and the ablation spot radius corresponds to the radius of maximum intensity in the doughnut profile. Ignore any thermal diffusion effects.</question>`

**Critique:**
*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** Yes, relevant.
*   **2. Expect answers as symbolic or numerical:** Numerical, with units. Good.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes, calculation of focal spot size and then specific radius.
*   **4. Be Unique:** Yes, specific scenario.
*   **5. Single Solution:** Yes, under the given definitions.
*   **6. Rigorous, Concise Phrasing:** No, definition of ablation spot is problematic.
*   **7. All assumptions clearly stated, all variables defined:** Yes.
*   **8. Units consistent, symbols conventional:** Yes.
*   **9. Not multipart:** Single quantity.
*   **10. Question Formatting:** Correct.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Clarify Doughnut Origin/Consistency:** The parameters ($w_0 = 1 \, \mathrm{mm}$, $f = 10 \, \mathrm{cm}$) imply a low numerical aperture ($NA \approx w_0/f = 0.01$). For a radially polarized beam focused at low NA, the intensity profile at focus is *not* typically a doughnut; it's a tight spot. A doughnut shape for a radially polarized beam at focus usually implies high-NA focusing (Richards-Wolf theory) or the presence of a topological charge ($l=1$). The problem should either:
    *   State that the beam acquires a topological charge (e.g., $l=1$), in which case the "radially polarized" aspect is somewhat secondary to the vortex, OR
    *   Change the lens/NA parameters to be high enough to justify a doughnut profile for a focused radially polarized beam, OR
    *   Remove the "doughnut shape" assumption if it's not intended to be a high-NA or vortex beam.
2.  **Redefine Ablation Spot/Redundant Information:** The current phrasing "the ablation spot radius corresponds to the radius of maximum intensity in the doughnut profile" makes the provided "ablation threshold $I_{th}$" and "total power $P$" completely redundant for the calculation. This violates the spirit of "force multi-step reasoning" by rendering core information useless. To improve, redefine the ablation spot radius to be where the intensity drops to $I_{th}$, forcing the student to use $P$ and $I_{th}$ to calculate the actual intensity profile and then find the corresponding radius.

**Question 5 Critique:**

`<question>A radially chirped beam with an initial Gaussian spatial profile ($w_0 = 3 \, \mathrm{mm}$) is incident on a diffraction grating. The central wavelength of the beam is $\lambda_0 = 1030 \, \mathrm{nm}$, and the radial chirp is defined as $\lambda(r) = \lambda_0 + \beta r$, where $\beta = 2 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{m}^{-1}$. The diffraction grating has a groove spacing of $d = 1 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$. Assuming the beam is incident at the Littrow angle for the central wavelength, calculate the angular dispersion $d\theta/d\lambda$ (in radians per nanometer) of the diffracted beam at the central wavelength. Assume the grating equation $d \sin(\theta) = m \lambda$, where $m$ is the diffraction order.</question>`

**Critique:**
*   **1. Model a Physics Scenario:** Yes, relevant to optics/spectroscopy.
*   **2. Expect answers as symbolic or numerical:** Numerical, with units. Good.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes, requires using Littrow condition with grating equation and differentiation.
*   **4. Be Unique:** Yes, the combination with a chirped beam is novel.
*   **5. Single Solution:** No, missing critical information.
*   **6. Rigorous, Concise Phrasing:** Missing critical information.
*   **7. All assumptions clearly stated, all variables defined:** Almost, but $m$ is not defined.
*   **8. Units consistent, symbols conventional:** Yes.
*   **9. Not multipart:** Single quantity.
*   **10. Question Formatting:** Correct.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Missing Information:** The diffraction order $m$ is not specified. The grating equation $d \sin(\theta) = m \lambda$ applies to different orders ($m=0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \dots$). This is crucial for a unique numerical answer. Explicitly state the diffraction order (e.g., "for the first diffraction order, $m=1$").
2.  **Redundant Information:** The details about the "radially chirped beam" ($w_0$, $\beta$, $\lambda(r)$) are entirely irrelevant to calculating the angular dispersion of the grating. This is a distractor that doesn't add to the problem's core complexity for the requested quantity. Remove these details if the intent is solely to test grating angular dispersion, or integrate them into a more complex problem where they are actually used (e.g., calculate the spatial spread of the beam after the grating due to the chirp and dispersion).

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Physics Scenario):** Adheres well. It describes a realistic optical setup.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Format):** Adheres well. A single numerical value with units is requested.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Adheres, if the student is expected to know the $LG_{01}$ intensity profile and derive the radius of maximum intensity by differentiation. This is a common approach for such problems.
*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** Adheres. While LG beams are known, this specific calculation is not a trivial textbook problem.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** **Partial Adherence.** The definition of "$w_f = 5 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$" for an $LG_{01}$ beam is ambiguous. For an $LG_{01}$ beam, "$w$" typically refers to the $1/e^2$ intensity radius of the *embedded Gaussian* envelope. If $w_f$ *is* this Gaussian waist, then the intensity maximum is at $r = w_f/\sqrt{2}$. The question should explicitly state this to avoid ambiguity.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, concise phrasing; no hints):** Adheres well. Phrasing is clear and professional.
*   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions/Variables defined):** **Minor Issue.** As mentioned in G5, "$w_f$" could be interpreted differently for an $LG_{01}$ beam. It should be explicitly defined as the Gaussian beam waist of the envelope.
*   **Guideline 8 (Units/Symbols):** Adheres well. Units are consistent, and symbols are conventional.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not multipart; no hints):** Adheres well.
*   **Guideline 10 (Formatting):** **Does Not Adhere.** Numerical values and their units are not consistently enclosed within LaTeX math mode. There should be a non-breaking space (`\,`) between the number and its unit.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1.  **Clarify Variable Definition:** Specify that "$w_f$" refers to the $1/e^2$ intensity radius of the *embedded Gaussian envelope* of the $LG_{01}$ beam. For example: "resulting in a focused beam with an embedded Gaussian waist size of $w_f = 5 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$."
2.  **Correct Formatting:** Ensure all numerical values and their units are enclosed in LaTeX math mode with appropriate spacing.
    *   Change `800 \, \mathrm{nm}` to `$800 \, \mathrm{nm}$`.
    *   Change `5 \, \mathrm{\mu m}` to `$5 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$`.

### Question 2

```xml
<question>A radially chirped Gaussian beam with a central wavelength of $\lambda_0 = 1064 \, \mathrm{nm}$ and a pulse duration of $\tau_0 = 100 \, \mathrm{fs}$ (full width at half maximum) is generated. The beam's radial chirp is such that the wavelength varies linearly with the radial distance $r$ from the beam's center, described by $\lambda(r) = \lambda_0 + \alpha r$, where $\alpha = 1 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{m}^{-1}$. The initial beam waist (radius at $1/e^2$ intensity) is $w_0 = 2 \, \mathrm{mm}$. This beam is sent through a specially designed pulse compressor. The pulse compressor is designed to compensate for the radial chirp by introducing a spatially varying group delay. Assuming the pulse compressor perfectly compensates the radial chirp, what is the duration of the shortest pulse (in femtoseconds) obtainable at the output? Assume a transform-limited pulse shape.</question>
```

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Physics Scenario):** Adheres well. Radially chirped beams and pulse compressors are advanced topics in ultrafast optics.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Format):** Adheres well. A single numerical value with units is requested.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Does Not Adhere.** This is the primary flaw. The problem is ambiguous and potentially trivial.
    *   If "radial chirp" only affects the *spatial distribution of wavelength* but not the *temporal chirp of individual pulses*, and $\tau_0$ is already the transform-limited duration, then the compensation is spatial, and the temporal duration remains $\tau_0$. This would make it a 1-step problem (answer is simply $\tau_0$), violating the multi-step requirement.
    *   If the radial chirp *induces* temporal chirp across the beam, the question doesn't provide enough information to calculate the initial (non-transform-limited) temporal duration from $\tau_0$ or how the radial chirp translates into spectral broadening that would be compressed.
    *   The statement "Assume a transform-limited pulse shape" at the output implies that whatever chirp was present (spatial or temporal) has been removed. If $\tau_0$ is the initial FWHM duration, and the compressor makes it transform-limited, this suggests $\tau_0$ *is* the transform-limited duration, making the problem trivial.
*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** Adheres well. The concept is unique and less common.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** **Does Not Adhere.** Due to the ambiguity in G3, the interpretation of the problem's effect on pulse duration is unclear, leading to potential multiple interpretations or a trivial answer.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, concise phrasing; no hints):** Phrasing is mostly good, but the ambiguity regarding "radial chirp" and its impact on "temporal pulse duration" at a single point needs clarification.
*   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions/Variables defined):** Adheres well. All variables are defined, and assumptions are stated.
*   **Guideline 8 (Units/Symbols):** Adheres well. Units are consistent, and symbols are conventional.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not multipart; no hints):** Adheres well.
*   **Guideline 10 (Formatting):** **Does Not Adhere.** Numerical values and their units are not consistently enclosed within LaTeX math mode with appropriate spacing.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1.  **Clarify the Role of Radial Chirp:** Explain how the radial chirp affects the *temporal* properties of the pulse that the compressor is designed to fix. For example, does it mean the *overall beam's* spectrum is broadened, leading to a longer average pulse duration if not compensated? Or does it mean individual pulses at different radial positions have different temporal chirps? Without this, the link to "shortest pulse" is missing.
2.  **Ensure Multi-Step Reasoning:** If the intent is for the answer to be $\tau_0$, the question is too simple. If not, provide the necessary information (e.g., how to relate the radial chirp to temporal chirp or spectral bandwidth) to enable a multi-step calculation.
3.  **Correct Formatting:** Ensure all numerical values and their units are enclosed in LaTeX math mode with appropriate spacing.
    *   Change `1064 \, \mathrm{nm}` to `$1064 \, \mathrm{nm}$`.
    *   Change `100 \, \mathrm{fs}` to `$100 \, \mathrm{fs}$`.

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Physics Scenario):** Adheres well. A standard and relevant scenario in laser-plasma physics.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Format):** Adheres well. A single numerical value with units (dimensionless for refractive index) is requested to a specific precision.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Adheres well. Requires calculating the laser frequency $\omega$ from $\lambda$ and then applying the plasma refractive index formula.

```xml
<question>A radially polarized beam is formed by interfering two linearly polarized beams with orthogonal polarizations and a $\pi/2$ phase difference. The initial beams have Gaussian profiles with waists $w_0 = 1 \, \mathrm{mm}$ at $\lambda = 532 \, \mathrm{nm}$ wavelength and are focused by an ideal lens with focal length $f = 10 \, \mathrm{cm}$. After the lens, the beam is focused onto a metal surface, where it generates an ablation spot. Assume the ablation threshold is reached when the intensity at the focal point exceeds $I_{th} = 1 \times 10^{12} \, \mathrm{W/m^2}$. If the total power of the radially polarized beam is $P = 1 \, \mathrm{W}$, determine the radius (in micrometers) of the expected ablation spot, defined as the radius where the intensity at the focal point drops to $I_{th}$. Assume the intensity profile is approximated by $I(r) = \frac{2 P}{\pi w^2} \frac{2r^2}{w^2}e^{-2r^2/w^2}$, where $w$ is the beam waist at the focal plane and $r$ is the radial distance from the beam's center. Ignore any thermal diffusion effects.</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Physics Scenario):** Adheres well. Realistic scenario in laser material processing.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Format):** Adheres well. A single numerical value with units is requested.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Partial Adherence/Major Issue.**
    *   Calculating the focused beam waist $w$ from the initial Gaussian waist $w_0$ and focal length $f$ is a multi-step process.
    *   However, solving for $r$ when $I(r) = I_{th}$ from the given intensity profile $I(r) \propto r^2 e^{-Cr^2}$ typically requires solving a transcendental equation (e.g., using the Lambert W function) or numerical methods. This is generally *not* expected in standard physics assessments asking for a single numerical answer unless computational tools are explicitly allowed. If the question expects an analytical solution, the values of $P$, $w$, and $I_{th}$ must be carefully chosen such that a simple algebraic solution for $r$ exists (e.g., if $I_{th}$ corresponds to the peak intensity, then $r = w/\sqrt{2}$). Based on the given values, $I_{th}$ is below the peak intensity, necessitating a numerical approach.
*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** Adheres well. The combination of radially polarized beams and ablation is unique.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** **Partial Adherence.** A single numerical solution *exists* but requires numerical methods not typically expected in a closed-form assessment. This violates the spirit of "Single Solution" if a non-numerical solution is implied.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, concise phrasing; no hints):** Adheres well. Phrasing is clear and professional.
*   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions/Variables defined):** Adheres well. All variables are defined, and assumptions are clearly stated.
*   **Guideline 8 (Units/Symbols):** Adheres well. Units are consistent, and symbols are conventional.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not multipart; no hints):** Adheres well.
*   **Guideline 10 (Formatting):** **Does Not Adhere.** Numerical values and their units are not consistently enclosed within LaTeX math mode with appropriate spacing.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1.  **Address Numerical Solution Expectation:**
    *   **Option A (Recommended for standard exams):** Modify the question so that $I_{th}$ corresponds to a specific, easily solvable point on the intensity curve (e.g., the peak intensity or a point where the equation simplifies). For the given profile, the peak intensity is at $r=w/\sqrt{2}$, and its value is $I_{max} = \frac{2P}{\pi w^2} e^{-1}$. If $I_{th}$ is set to this value, the problem becomes analytically solvable.
    *   **Option B (If numerical methods are allowed):** Explicitly state that numerical methods or computational tools are expected to solve the transcendental equation for $r$.
2.  **Correct Formatting:** Ensure all numerical values and their units are enclosed in LaTeX math mode with appropriate spacing.
    *   Change `1 \, \mathrm{mm}` to `$1 \, \mathrm{mm}$`.
    *   Change `532 \, \mathrm{nm}` to `$532 \, \mathrm{nm}$`.
    *   Change `10 \, \mathrm{cm}` to `$10 \, \mathrm{cm}$`.
    *   Change `1 \times 10^{12} \, \mathrm{W/m^2}` to `$1 \times 10^{12} \, \mathrm{W/m^2}$`.
    *   Change `1 \, \mathrm{W}` to `$1 \, \mathrm{W}$`.
    *   Change `2 P` to `$2 P$` (within the fraction).
    *   Change `2r^2` to `$2r^2$` (within the fraction).
    *   Change `2r^2/w^2` to `$2r^2/w^2$` (in the exponential).

### Question 5

```xml
<question>A beam is incident on a diffraction grating. The central wavelength of the beam is $\lambda_0 = 1030 \, \mathrm{nm}$, and the grating has a groove spacing of $d = 1 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$. Assuming the beam is incident at the Littrow angle for the central wavelength and the first diffraction order ($m=1$), calculate the angular dispersion $d\theta/d\lambda$ (in radians per nanometer) of the diffracted beam at the central wavelength. Assume the grating equation $d \sin(\theta) = m \lambda$, where $m$ is the diffraction order.</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Physics Scenario):** Adheres well. A classic and relevant optics scenario.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Format):** Adheres well. A single numerical value with units is requested.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Adheres well. If the ambiguity is resolved, it requires calculating the Littrow angle and then differentiating the grating equation.
*   **Guideline 4 (Be Unique):** Adheres well. Littrow configuration and angular dispersion are standard, but the specific values make it unique enough.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** **Does Not Adhere.** This is the major issue. The provided grating equation "$d \sin(\theta) = m \lambda$" is a simplified version, usually for normal incidence. The correct grating equation for incident angle $\theta_{inc}$ and diffracted angle $\theta_{diff}$ is $d(\sin \theta_{inc} \pm \sin \theta_{diff}) = m \lambda$. For the Littrow configuration, where $\theta_{inc} = \theta_{diff} = \theta_L$ (and both are on the same side of the normal), the condition is $2d \sin(\theta_L) = m \lambda_0$.
    *   If the student is forced to use *only* the given equation $d \sin(\theta) = m \lambda$ with $\theta = \theta_L$, they will calculate a different (smaller) Littrow angle than correct, leading to a different angular dispersion. This ambiguity creates two possible answers, violating "Single Solution."
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, concise phrasing; no hints):** **Partial Adherence.** The phrasing is mostly rigorous, but the "Assume the grating equation..." part, by providing a simplified equation for a complex scenario (Littrow), implicitly creates a misleading hint or a fundamental conceptual error source.
*   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions/Variables defined):** **Minor Issue.** The provided grating equation is the problematic assumption that needs correction.
*   **Guideline 8 (Units/Symbols):** Adheres well. Units are consistent, and symbols are conventional.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not multipart; no hints):** Adheres well.
*   **Guideline 10 (Formatting):** **Does Not Adhere.** Numerical values and their units are not consistently enclosed within LaTeX math mode with appropriate spacing.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1.  **Correct Grating Equation for Littrow:** Replace the simplified grating equation with the correct general form: `Assume the grating equation $d (\sin \theta_{inc} + \sin \theta_{diff}) = m \lambda$, where $\theta_{inc}$ is the angle of incidence and $\theta_{diff}$ is the angle of diffraction, both measured from the grating normal.` Then, clarify the Littrow condition (`where $\theta_{inc} = \theta_{diff} = \theta_L$, the Littrow angle`). This ensures a single, correct path to the solution.
2.  **Correct Formatting:** Ensure all numerical values and their units are enclosed in LaTeX math mode with appropriate spacing.
    *   Change `1030 \, \mathrm{nm}` to `$1030 \, \mathrm{nm}$`.
    *   Change `1 \, \mathrm{\mu m}` to `$1 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$`.

<question>A Gaussian beam is converted into a first-order optical vortex ($LG_{01}$) beam with a wavelength of $\lambda = 800 \, \mathrm{nm}$. This vortex beam is then focused by a lens, resulting in a focused beam with an embedded Gaussian waist size of $w_f = 5 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$. Calculate the radius (in meters) of the resulting doughnut-shaped intensity profile at the focal plane ($z=0$), defining the radius as the distance from the optical axis to the point of maximum intensity. Assume the intensity is proportional to the square of the electric field amplitude.</question>

<question>A radially chirped Gaussian beam with a central wavelength of $\lambda_0 = 1064 \, \mathrm{nm}$ and a pulse duration of $\tau_0 = 100 \, \mathrm{fs}$ (full width at half maximum) is generated. The beam's radial chirp is such that the wavelength varies linearly with the radial distance $r$ from the beam's center, described by $\lambda(r) = \lambda_0 + \alpha r$, where $\alpha = 1 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{m}^{-1}$. This radial chirp also leads to a broadening of the beam's overall spectral bandwidth. The initial beam waist (radius at $1/e^2$ intensity) is $w_0 = 2 \, \mathrm{mm}$. This beam is sent through a specially designed pulse compressor. The pulse compressor is designed to compensate for the radial chirp by introducing a spatially varying group delay, effectively compressing the broadened spectral bandwidth. Assuming the pulse compressor perfectly compensates the radial chirp, what is the duration of the shortest pulse (in femtoseconds) obtainable at the output? Assume a transform-limited pulse shape and that the initial pulse duration $\tau_0$ corresponds to the transform limit of the *un-chirped* central wavelength.</question>

Calculate the refractive index experienced by the laser pulse as it propagates through the plasma. Give your answer to five decimal places.</question>
