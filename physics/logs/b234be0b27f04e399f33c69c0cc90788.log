<question>Consider a particle undergoing a random walk on a 2D square lattice with lattice spacing $a$. The particle starts at the origin and its goal is to reach a target site located at a distance $r$ from the origin. The probability of moving to any of the four nearest neighbor sites is equal. The particle is also subject to a "reset" mechanism, where it returns to the origin with a probability $r$ per unit time. Assuming the reset rate $r$ is very large, find the approximate mean first passage time (MFPT) to reach the target site, neglecting the time it takes to reset. Express your answer in terms of $r$ and the lattice Green's function $G(r)$, where $G(r)$ is the lattice Green’s function between the origin and a site a distance r away.

*   **Guideline 1 (Physics Scenario):** Satisfied. Clear idealized random walk scenario.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Satisfied. Expects a symbolic expression.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Satisfied. Requires understanding random walks, MFPT, reset mechanisms, Green's functions, and taking a specific limit.
*   **Guideline 4 (Unique):** Satisfied. Combines several concepts in a novel way.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** Satisfied. One unique symbolic expression is expected.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing / No Hints):**
    *   **Issue:** The phrase "negligible the time it takes to reset" contains a grammatical error; it should be "neglecting the time it takes to reset."
    *   **Issue:** The last sentence, "Assume the stationary distribution approaches being completely localized around the origin when the reset rate goes to infinity," is a significant hint. It guides the student towards a specific mathematical simplification or approximation strategy, violating the "no hints" rule.
    *   **Major Issue:** The symbol `$r$` is used ambiguously for two distinct physical quantities: the target distance from the origin and the reset probability/rate. This makes the question fundamentally ill-defined.
*   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions/Variables Clearly Stated):**
    *   **Issue:** `$r$` is used for both target distance and reset rate. This is a critical ambiguity and means variables are *not* clearly defined separately.
    *   "probability $r$ per unit time" is slightly awkward phrasing for a rate. "Reset rate $r$" would be clearer.
*   **Guideline 8 (Consistent Units / Conventional Notation):**
    *   **Issue:** Inconsistent use of `$r$`. Conventional notation is violated by reusing symbols for different quantities.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not Multipart / No Hints):** Satisfied (not multipart), but violates "no hints."
*   **Guideline 10 (Question Formatting):** Satisfied. Correct LaTeX formatting.

**Feedback for Question 1:**
1.  **Resolve Ambiguity:** Use distinct symbols for the target distance (e.g., $L$ or $R$) and the reset rate (e.g., $\lambda$ or $\gamma$). This is the most critical flaw.
2.  **Remove Hint:** Delete the sentence "Assume the stationary distribution approaches being completely localized around the origin when the reset rate goes to infinity." The limit definition should be sufficient.
3.  **Refine Phrasing:** Change "negligible the time it takes to reset" to "neglecting the time it takes to reset." Change "probability $r$ per unit time" to "reset rate $\lambda$."

`<question>A particle diffuses on an infinite 1D lattice with hopping rate $w$ to neighboring sites. A target site is located at a distance $x$ from the starting point. In addition to hopping, the particle has a probability $r$ per unit time to return to its starting point (reset). Assuming that the reset probability $r$ is much larger than the hopping rate $w$, find an approximate expression for the mean first passage time (MFPT) to the target site. Express your answer in terms of $x$, $r$, and $w$.</question>`

*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing / No Hints):** Satisfied. Phrasing is good, and no hints are provided.
*   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions/Variables Clearly Stated):** Satisfied. All variables ($x$, $r$, $w$) are distinct and clearly defined. The assumption about the limit is stated. "Probability $r$ per unit time" is an acceptable definition for a rate in this context, although "reset rate $r$" would be more concise.
*   **Guideline 8 (Consistent Units / Conventional Notation):** Satisfied. Units are consistent (rates are 1/time, distances are length). Notation is conventional.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not Multipart / No Hints):** Satisfied. Not multipart, no hints.
*   **Guideline 10 (Question Formatting):** Satisfied. Correct LaTeX formatting.

**Feedback for Question 2:**
1.  **Minor Refinement:** Consider changing "probability $r$ per unit time" to "reset rate $r$" for conciseness and clarity, although it's not a critical issue here as `$r$` is not ambiguous.

*   **Guideline 1 (Physics Scenario):** Satisfied. Clear idealized random walk scenario.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Satisfied. Expects a symbolic expression.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Satisfied. Requires understanding random walks in $d$-dimensions, MFPT, reset mechanisms, and handling two limits (reset rate to zero, target distance large). This is complex.
*   **Guideline 4 (Unique):** Satisfied. Seems novel, especially the $d$-dimensional aspect and the specific limits.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** Satisfied. One unique symbolic expression is expected.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing / No Hints):**
    *   **Major Issue:** The symbol `$r$` is used ambiguously for two distinct physical quantities: the target distance from the origin and the reset probability/rate. This makes the question fundamentally ill-defined.
    *   "probability $r$ of resetting to the origin per unit time" is slightly awkward phrasing for a rate.
*   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions/Variables Clearly Stated):**
    *   **Issue:** `$r$` is used for both target distance and reset rate. This is a critical ambiguity.
    *   "any other relevant parameters" is slightly vague. While it doesn't violate the rule, it's less precise than explicitly listing all parameters the answer should be in terms of.
*   **Guideline 8 (Consistent Units / Conventional Notation):**
    *   **Issue:** Inconsistent use of `$r$`. Conventional notation is violated by reusing symbols for different quantities.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not Multipart / No Hints):** Satisfied. Not multipart, no hints.

2.  **Refine Phrasing:** Change "probability $r$ of resetting to the origin per unit time" to "reset rate $\lambda$."
3.  **Specify Parameters (Optional):** Consider explicitly listing all expected parameters in the final expression, rather than "any other relevant parameters."

**Question 4 Critique:**

`<question>A particle is performing a random walk on a finite one-dimensional lattice with $N$ sites, labeled $1$ to $N$. The particle starts at site $1$, and the target is site $N$. The particle can hop to the left or right with equal probability, except at the boundaries where it reflects back.

Find the stationary non-equilibrium probability distribution $P_i$ of the particle across the sites $i = 1, 2, ..., N$ in the limit of large time ($t \to \infty$), assuming the reset rate $r$ is nonzero.</question>`

*   **Guideline 1 (Physics Scenario):** Satisfied. Clear idealized random walk scenario.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** The answer is a symbolic expression for $P_i$, but $P_i$ represents a *distribution* (a set of $N$ values), not a single numerical value or a single symbolic quantity like MFPT.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Satisfied. Requires setting up master equations, applying boundary conditions, and solving for the steady-state distribution, which is complex.
*   **Guideline 4 (Unique):** Satisfied. Seems novel enough.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** The *form* of $P_i$ is unique, but it represents $N$ values, not a single one. This is borderline given the "single solution" rule.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing / No Hints):** Satisfied. Phrasing is clear, no hints. "Probability $r$ per unit time" is consistent here.
*   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions/Variables Clearly Stated):** Satisfied. All variables ($N$, $r$, $P_i$) are distinct and clearly defined.
*   **Guideline 8 (Consistent Units / Conventional Notation):** Satisfied.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not Multipart / No Hints):**

*   **Guideline 10 (Question Formatting):** Satisfied. Correct LaTeX formatting.

**Feedback for Question 4:**
1.  **Address Single Target Quantity:** Rephrase the question to ask for a *single quantity* derived from the distribution, rather than the distribution itself. For example, "Find the average position of the particle in the stationary state," or "Find the probability of finding the particle at the target site $N$ in the stationary state."
2.  **Minor Refinement:** Consider changing "probability $r$ per unit time" to "reset rate $r$."

**Question 5 Critique:**

`<question>A particle diffuses on an infinite 2D square lattice. The particle starts at the origin. A target site is located at a distance $r = (x,y)$ from the origin, where $x$ and $y$ are integers. In addition to hopping to adjacent sites, the particle can return to the origin with a probability $r$ per unit time. Calculate the difference in the Mean First Passage Time (MFPT) when the target is a nearest neighbor of the origin compared to when the target is far away (i.e., r approaches infinity). Assume a small, non-zero reset rate $r$. Express your answer in terms of the lattice Green's function $G(r)$, the reset rate $r$, and any other relevant parameters.</question>`

*   **Guideline 1 (Physics Scenario):** Satisfied. Clear idealized random walk scenario.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Satisfied. Expects a single symbolic expression (a difference).
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Satisfied. Requires calculating two MFPTs under different conditions and then finding their difference, involving Green's functions and limits.
*   **Guideline 4 (Unique):** Satisfied. The "difference" aspect and specific limits make it unique.
*   **Guideline 5 (Single Solution):** Satisfied. One unique symbolic expression is expected.
*   **Guideline 6 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing / No Hints):**
    *   **Major Issue:** The symbol `$r$` is used ambiguously for three distinct physical quantities: the target location/distance (as a vector $(x,y)$), the reset probability/rate, and the variable in the Green's function $G(r)$. This makes the question fundamentally ill-defined.
    *   **Issue:** The phrase "Assume a small, non-zero reset rate $r$" is a hint. It directs the student to apply perturbation theory or a specific approximation for a small reset rate, violating the "no hints" rule.
    *   "probability $r$ per unit time" is slightly awkward phrasing for a rate.
*   **Guideline 7 (Assumptions/Variables Clearly Stated):**
    *   **Issue:** `$r$` is used ambiguously multiple times. This is a critical flaw.
    *   `$G(r)$` definition becomes ambiguous because of the overloaded `$r$`.
*   **Guideline 8 (Consistent Units / Conventional Notation):**
    *   **Issue:** Inconsistent use of `$r$`. Conventional notation is violated.
*   **Guideline 9 (Not Multipart / No Hints):** Satisfied (not multipart), but violates "no hints."
*   **Guideline 10 (Question Formatting):** Satisfied. Correct LaTeX formatting.

**Feedback for Question 5:**
1.  **Resolve Ambiguity:** Use distinct symbols for the target location (e.g., $\vec{R}$ or $(x,y)$ without an `$r` prefix`), the reset rate (e.g., $\lambda$), and the argument of the Green's function (e.g., $G(\vec{R})$ or $G(d)$ where $d$ is distance). This is the most critical flaw.
2.  **Remove Hint:** Delete "Assume a small, non-zero reset rate $r$." The problem should simply state the limit to be taken or the parameter regime of interest without guiding the method.
3.  **Refine Phrasing:** Change "probability $r$ per unit time" to "reset rate $\lambda$."

---

**Summary of Common Issues and General Recommendations:**

1.  **Symbol Ambiguity (Critical):** The most severe and pervasive issue is the repeated use of the symbol `$r$` for multiple, distinct physical quantities (target distance/position and reset rate). This is a fundamental flaw in question design and must be corrected in all affected questions (Q1, Q3, Q5). Use unique symbols for each variable (e.g., $R$ for distance, $\lambda$ for reset rate).
2.  **Hints in Questions:** Guidelines explicitly state "no hints." Questions 1 and 5 provide explicit hints that guide the solver towards a specific approximation or solution strategy. These should be removed. Assumptions should state conditions, not solutions.
3.  **"Probability per unit time" Phrasing:** While technically understandable, "reset rate $\lambda$" is more standard, concise, and professional than "probability $\lambda$ per unit time" when describing a continuous-time process.
4.  **Single Target Quantity:** Question 4 asks for a *distribution* ($P_i$), which is a collection of values, violating the guideline that "Each question must focus on solving for a single target quantity only." Rephrase such questions to ask for a specific, single metric derived from the distribution.
=== Turn 1: Author refines questions ===
Okay, here are the refined questions based on your feedback, addressing symbol ambiguities, removing hints, improving phrasing, and ensuring each question focuses on a single target quantity.

<question>Consider a particle undergoing a random walk on a 2D square lattice with lattice spacing $a$. The particle starts at the origin and its goal is to reach a target site located at a distance $R$ from the origin. The probability of moving to any of the four nearest neighbor sites is equal. The particle is also subject to a reset mechanism, where it returns to the origin with a reset rate $\lambda$. Assuming the reset rate $\lambda$ is very large, find the approximate mean first passage time (MFPT) to reach the target site, neglecting the time it takes to reset. Express your answer in terms of $\lambda$ and the lattice Green's function $G(R)$, where $G(R)$ is the lattice Green’s function between the origin and a site a distance $R$ away.</question>

<question>A particle diffuses on an infinite 1D lattice with hopping rate $w$ to neighboring sites. A target site is located at a distance $x$ from the starting point. In addition to hopping, the particle has a reset rate $r$ to return to its starting point. Assuming that the reset rate $r$ is much larger than the hopping rate $w$, find an approximate expression for the mean first passage time (MFPT) to the target site. Express your answer in terms of $x$, $r$, and $w$.</question>

<question>A particle is performing a random walk on an infinite d-dimensional hypercubic lattice with lattice spacing $a$. The particle starts at the origin and needs to reach a target located at a distance $R$ from the origin. Each lattice site is connected to $2d$ neighbors, and the probability of hopping to any of these neighbors is equal. The particle also has a reset rate $\lambda$ of resetting to the origin. Determine the asymptotic behavior of the mean first passage time (MFPT) to the target site when the distance $R$ is large, in the limit where $\lambda$ approaches zero. Express your answer as a function of $R$, $d$, $a$, and $\lambda$.</question>

<question>A particle is performing a random walk on a finite one-dimensional lattice with $N$ sites, labeled $1$ to $N$. The particle starts at site $1$, and the target is site $N$. The particle can hop to the left or right with equal probability, except at the boundaries where it reflects back. Furthermore, the particle has a reset rate $r$ to the starting site (site 1). Find the probability $P_N$ of finding the particle at the target site $N$ in the stationary state (i.e., as $t \to \infty$), assuming the reset rate $r$ is nonzero.</question>

<question>A particle diffuses on an infinite 2D square lattice. The particle starts at the origin. A target site is located at a position $\vec{R} = (x,y)$ from the origin, where $x$ and $y$ are integers. In addition to hopping to adjacent sites, the particle has a reset rate $\lambda$ to return to the origin. Calculate the difference in the Mean First Passage Time (MFPT) when the target is a nearest neighbor of the origin compared to when the target is far away (i.e., $|\vec{R}|$ approaches infinity). Assume a non-zero reset rate $\lambda$. Express your answer in terms of the lattice Green's function $G(\vec{R})$, the reset rate $\lambda$, and any other relevant parameters.</question>
```
Key changes made:

*   **Symbol Ambiguity Resolved:**  `r` for distance/position was replaced with `R` (questions 1 & 3) and `\vec{R}` (question 5).  `r` for the reset rate was replaced by `\lambda` (questions 1, 3, & 5) *or* retained as `r` where it was unambiguous (question 2 & 4). The argument to Green's functions was also adjusted accordingly (e.g., `G(R)` or `G(\vec{R})`).
*   **Hints Removed:** The explicit hint about the stationary distribution in Q1 and the small reset rate in Q5 were removed. The questions now only state the relevant limits or conditions without suggesting a specific solution strategy.
*   **Phrasing Improved:** Instances of "probability per unit time" were changed to the more concise "reset rate" where appropriate.
*   **Single Target Quantity (Q4):** Q4 was rephrased to ask for the probability of finding the particle at the target site $N$ in the stationary state, rather than the entire probability distribution.
*   **Vectors:** Clarified that `R` is a distance whereas `\vec{R}` is a position vector.
*   **Clarity:** Minor adjustments to phrasing for improved clarity and flow.

### Specific Critiques and Actionable Feedback:

#### Question 1:
`<question>Consider a particle undergoing a random walk on a 2D square lattice with lattice spacing $a$. The particle starts at the origin and its goal is to reach a target site located at a distance $R$ from the origin. The probability of moving to any of the four nearest neighbor sites is equal. The particle is also subject to a reset mechanism, where it returns to the origin with a reset rate $\lambda$. Assume resets are instantaneous and the reset rate $\lambda$ is very large. Find the approximate mean first passage time (MFPT) to reach the target site. Express your answer in terms of $\lambda$ and the lattice Green's function $G(R)$, where $G(R)$ is the steady-state lattice Green's function between the origin and a site at distance $R$ away for the random walk without reset.</question>`

*   **Critique (7. All assumptions clearly stated & 8. Consistent units/notation):**
    *   The phrase "Assume resets are instantaneous" is excellent for clarifying the modeling assumption.
    *   The definition of `$G(R)$` is now very precise and aligns with how such functions are typically used in these problems (i.e., for the un-reset walk). This addresses previous feedback well.
*   **Formatting (11):** No issues.

#### Question 2:
`<question>A particle diffuses on an infinite 1D lattice with hopping rate $w$ to neighboring sites. A target site is located at a distance $x$ from the starting point. In addition to hopping, the particle has a reset rate $r$ to return to its starting point. Assuming that the reset rate $r$ is much larger than the hopping rate $w$, find an approximate expression for the mean first passage time (MFPT) to the target site. Express your answer in terms of $x$, $r$, and $w$.</question>`

*   **Critique (6. Rigorous, concise phrasing; 7. Assumptions/Variables):** All assumptions are clearly stated (`$r \gg w$`, infinite 1D lattice), and variables are well-defined.
*   **Formatting (11):** No issues.

#### Question 3:
`<question>A particle is performing a random walk on an infinite d-dimensional hypercubic lattice with lattice spacing $a$. The particle starts at the origin and needs to reach a target located at a distance $R$ from the origin. Each lattice site is connected to $2d$ neighbors, and the probability of hopping to any of these neighbors is equal. The particle also has a reset rate $\lambda$ of resetting to the origin. Determine the asymptotic behavior of the mean first passage time (MFPT) to the target site when the distance $R$ is large, in the limit where $\lambda$ approaches zero. Express your answer as a function of $R$, $d$, $a$, and $\lambda$.</question>`

*   **Critique (11. Formatting):**
    *   **Actionable Feedback:** The number of neighbors `$2d$` should be in math mode: "connected to $2d$ neighbors".
*   **Critique (7. All assumptions clearly stated & 8. Consistent units/notation):** Assumptions are clear (`$R$ is large`, `$\lambda \to 0$`), variables are well-defined.

#### Question 4:
`<question>A particle is performing a random walk on a finite one-dimensional lattice with $N$ sites, labeled $1$ to $N$. The particle starts at site $1$, and the target is site $N$. The particle can hop to the left or right with equal probability, except at the boundaries where it reflects back. Furthermore, the particle has a reset rate $r$ to the starting site (site $1$). Find the probability $P_N$ of finding the particle at the target site $N$ in the stationary state (i.e., as $t \to \infty$), assuming the reset rate $r$ is nonzero.</question>`

*   **Critique (11. Formatting):**
    *   **Actionable Feedback:** The site numbers `$1$` and `$N$` should be in math mode consistently throughout: "labeled $1$ to $N$", "starts at site $1$", "target is site $N$", "reset rate $r$ to the starting site (site $1$)".
*   **Critique (6. Rigorous, concise phrasing; 7. Assumptions/Variables):** Assumptions are clear (`$r$ is nonzero`), variables are well-defined.

#### Question 5:
`<question>A particle diffuses on an infinite 2D square lattice with a hopping rate $w$ to adjacent sites. The particle starts at the origin. A target site is located at a position $\vec{R} = (x,y)$ from the origin, where $x$ and $y$ are integers. In addition to hopping, the particle has a reset rate $\lambda$ to return to the origin. Calculate the difference in the Mean First Passage Time (MFPT) when the target is a nearest neighbor of the origin compared to when the target is far away (i.e., $|\vec{R}|$ approaches infinity). Assume a non-zero reset rate $\lambda$. Express your answer in terms of the hopping rate $w$, the lattice Green's function $G(\vec{R})$, and the reset rate $\lambda$, where $G(\vec{R})$ is the steady-state lattice Green's function between the origin and the target site $\vec{R}$ for the random walk without reset.</question>`

*   **Critique (7. All assumptions clearly stated & 8. Consistent units/notation):**
    *   Adding "with a hopping rate $w$ to adjacent sites" and explicitly including `$w$` in the "Express your answer in terms of..." section is a significant improvement. It clarifies all necessary parameters.
    *   The explicit definition of `$G(\vec{R})$` as the steady-state Green's function for the un-reset walk is excellent for rigor.
    *   **Actionable Feedback:** The coordinates `$x$` and `$y$` in `$\vec{R} = (x,y)$` should be in math mode when mentioned as variables: "where $x$ and $y$ are integers".

---

### Summary of Final Actionable Feedback:
1.  **Question 3:** Enclose `$2d$` in math mode: "...connected to $2d$ neighbors..."
2.  **Question 4:** Enclose site numbers `$1$` and `$N$` in math mode: "...labeled $1$ to $N$...", "...starts at site $1$...", "...target is site $N$...", "...site $1$)."
3.  **Question 5:** Enclose coordinates `$x$` and `$y$` in math mode: "...where $x$ and $y$ are integers."

With these very minor adjustments, the questions will be excellent and fully conform to all guidelines. The rephrasing and explicit definitions of Green's functions, along with clear specification of parameters, have greatly enhanced their quality.

Assuming that the reset rate $r$ is much larger than the hopping rate $w$, find an approximate expression for the mean first passage time (MFPT) to the target site. Express your answer in terms of $x$, $r$, and $w$.</question>

<question>A particle is performing a random walk on an infinite d-dimensional hypercubic lattice with lattice spacing $a$. The particle starts at the origin and needs to reach a target located at a distance $R$ from the origin. Each lattice site is connected to $2d$ neighbors, and the probability of hopping to any of these neighbors is equal. The particle also has a reset rate $\lambda$ of resetting to the origin. Determine the asymptotic behavior of the mean first passage time (MFPT) to the target site when the distance $R$ is large, in the limit where $\lambda$ approaches zero. Express your answer as a function of $R$, $d$, $a$, and $\lambda$.</question>

<question>A particle is performing a random walk on a finite one-dimensional lattice with $N$ sites, labeled $1$ to $N$. The particle starts at site $1$, and the target is site $N$. The particle can hop to the left or right with equal probability, except at the boundaries where it reflects back. Furthermore, the particle has a reset rate $r$ to the starting site (site $1$). Find the probability $P_N$ of finding the particle at the target site $N$ in the stationary state (i.e., as $t \to \infty$), assuming the reset rate $r$ is nonzero.</question>

<question>A particle diffuses on an infinite 2D square lattice with a hopping rate $w$ to adjacent sites. The particle starts at the origin. A target site is located at a position $\vec{R} = (x,y)$ from the origin, where $x$ and $y$ are integers. In addition to hopping, the particle has a reset rate $\lambda$ to return to the origin. Calculate the difference in the Mean First Passage Time (MFPT) when the target is a nearest neighbor of the origin compared to when the target is far away (i.e., $|\vec{R}|$ approaches infinity). Assume a non-zero reset rate $\lambda$. Express your answer in terms of the hopping rate $w$, the lattice Green's function $G(\vec{R})$, and the reset rate $\lambda$, where $G(\vec{R})$ is the steady-state lattice Green's function between the origin and the target site $\vec{R}$ for the random walk without reset.</question>
