<question>Consider a four-dimensional effective field theory where the Higgs boson arises as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson in a Composite Higgs model with decay constant $f$. Given a scalar potential perturbation parameterized by a small symmetry-breaking parameter $\epsilon$, derive an expression for the leading-order deviation $\delta g_{hVV}$ of the Higgs coupling to electroweak gauge bosons $V=W,Z$ relative to the Standard Model coupling $g_{hVV}^{SM}$ in terms of $f$, the electroweak vacuum expectation value $v$, and $\epsilon$, assuming $v \ll f$ and linear response.</question>

<question>In a neutral naturalness framework, consider a dark sector containing a mirror top quark $t'$ and a mirror Higgs doublet $H'$, connected to the Standard Model via the Relaxion mechanism. If the relaxion field $\phi$ scans the Higgs mass parameter $\mu^2(\phi) = \mu_0^2 - g \phi$ where $g$ is a coupling constant, obtain a symbolic expression for the relaxion stopping condition $\phi = \phi_*$ that minimizes the Higgs mass and stabilizes the electroweak scale, given the periodic potential barrier induced by $t'$ loops is $V_b(\phi) = \Lambda_b^4 \cos(\phi/f_\phi)$. Express $\phi_*$ in terms of $g$, $\mu_0^2$, $\Lambda_b$, and $f_\phi$.</question>

<question>Within a scenario involving UV/IR mixing in a non-commutative field theory, consider a scalar field $\varphi$ whose propagator acquires a momentum-dependent correction $\Pi(p) = \alpha \frac{\Lambda_{UV}^2}{p^2 + m^2}$, where $\alpha$ is a dimensionless constant, $\Lambda_{UV}$ is the ultraviolet cutoff, and $m$ is the scalar mass. Derive the modified pole condition for the physical mass squared $M^2$ of $\varphi$ incorporating this self-energy correction, and provide an explicit equation relating $M^2$, $m^2$, $\alpha$, and $\Lambda_{UV}^2$.</question>

<question>Assuming a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ sourced by vacuum energy contributions, model a scenario where a composite Higgs sector at scale $f$ generates vacuum energy density shifts $\Delta \rho_{vac} \propto f^4 \sin^2(\theta)$ with $\theta$ a dynamical alignment angle. Given that observational constraints fix the effective cosmological constant energy density $\rho_\Lambda$ to a tiny value, derive an expression for the fine-tuning parameter $\Delta_{\Lambda}$ quantifying the ratio of natural composite Higgs vacuum energy to the observed $\rho_\Lambda$, expressed as $$\Delta_{\Lambda} = \frac{f^4}{\rho_\Lambda} \sin^2(\theta).$$ Analyze the parametric dependence assuming $f \gg \rho_\Lambda^{1/4}$.</question>

<question>Consider an experimental setup probing Higgs coupling deviations induced by the Neutral Naturalness paradigm, where hidden sector fermions couple to the Higgs through portal coupling $\kappa$. Given the one-loop correction to the Higgs self-energy $\Sigma_H(p^2)$ scales as $\kappa^2 \frac{p^2}{16 \pi^2} \ln \frac{\Lambda^2}{\mu^2}$ for renormalization scale $\mu$ and cutoff $\Lambda$, derive an expression for the relative Higgs coupling deviation $\delta g_h/g_h$ to leading-log order in terms of $\kappa$, $p^2$, $\Lambda$, and $\mu$ assuming $p^2 \sim m_h^2$ and $m_h$ is the Higgs mass.</question>
