Assuming that pions ($\\pi$) and protons ($p$) are emitted from this source, calculate the difference in the mean transverse momentum, $\\langle p_T \\rangle$, between pions and protons, i.e., $\\langle p_T \\rangle_\\pi - \\langle p_T \\rangle_p$, due solely to the radial flow, given $\\beta_{max} = 0.6$, $R = 10$ fm, $n = 2$, and assuming a common freeze-out temperature $T = 120$ MeV. Ignore the effect of resonance decays for both pions and protons. Use $m_\\pi = 140 \\, \\mathrm{MeV/c^2}$ and $m_p = 938 \\, \\mathrm{MeV/c^2}$. Express your answer in units of MeV/c.\n",
      "Generated question: A quark-gluon plasma created in a heavy-ion collision exhibits both radial flow and a temperature gradient. Assume the temperature decreases linearly with the radial distance from the center, such that $T(r) = T_0 - \\alpha r$, where $T_0$ is the central temperature, $\\alpha$ is the temperature gradient, and $r$ is the radial distance. The radial flow velocity is given by $\\beta(r) = \\beta_{max} \\frac{r}{R}$, where $\\beta_{max}$ is the maximum flow velocity at the edge ($r=R$) of the plasma. Calculate the average transverse momentum, $\\langle p_T \\rangle$, of direct photons emitted from this plasma. Assume that the photon emission rate is proportional to $T^2$ and that the photons are emitted isotropically in the local rest frame of the emitting source. Assume that the mean transverse momentum of thermal photons at temperature $T$ is $\\langle p_T \\rangle = 2T$ in the local rest frame. Express your answer in terms of $T_0$, $\\alpha$, $R$, $\\beta_{max}$, and any relevant physical constants.\n",
      "Generated question: In a heavy-ion collision, the measured elliptic flow, $v_2$, of charged particles is affected by both genuine collective flow and non-flow effects such as jet-particle correlations. Assume that the observed $v_2^{obs}$ can be decomposed into a flow component, $v_2^{flow}$, and a non-flow component, $v_2^{non-flow}$, such that $v_2^{obs} = v_2^{flow} + v_2^{non-flow}$. The non-flow component is estimated using a two-particle correlation method, yielding $v_2^{non-flow} = A/\\sqrt{N}$, where $A$ is a constant and $N$ is the number of particles used in the correlation. The observed $v_2$ is measured as a function of centrality, and it is found that $v_2^{obs} = 0.15$ for peripheral collisions with $N = 100$ at a centrality of $C=70$, and $v_2^{obs} = 0.25$ for central collisions with $N = 1000$ at a centrality of $C=10$. Assuming that the true flow component, $v_2^{flow}$, is linear with centrality (i.e. $v_2^{flow}=kC$), determine the flow component of the elliptic flow, $v_2^{flow}$, for a centrality of $50$. Note, for these collisions, $N=500$, and $C$ represents the centrality as a percentage (e.g., $C=70$ means $70\\%$).\n",
      "Generated question: Consider a scenario where the freeze-out temperature, $T$, in a heavy-ion collision fluctuates event-by-event according to a Gaussian distribution with a mean value $\\langle T \\rangle$ and a standard deviation $\\sigma_T$. Furthermore, the transverse flow velocity $\\beta$ fluctuates according to an independent Gaussian distribution with a mean $\\langle \\beta \\rangle$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_\\beta$. A particle with mass $m$ is emitted. Assuming that the particle's transverse momentum distribution follows a Boltzmann distribution in the local rest frame, calculate the relative change in the inverse slope parameter, $\\Delta I/I$, of the transverse momentum spectrum due to these fluctuations. Express your answer in terms of $\\langle T \\rangle$, $\\sigma_T$, $\\langle \\beta \\rangle$, $\\sigma_\\beta$ and $m$. Assume $\\sigma_T \\ll \\langle T \\rangle$ and $\\sigma_\\beta \\ll \\langle \\beta \\rangle$. The inverse slope parameter $I$ is equivalent to the effective temperature, $T_{eff}$, obtained from an exponential fit to $dN/dp_T$ at high $p_T$, where the distribution in the local rest frame is approximately  $dN/p_T dp_T dy \\propto m_T K_1(m_T/T) \\approx \\exp(-m_T/T)$ for large $p_T$ and $m_T = \\sqrt{m^2 + p_T^2}$.\n",

      "Writing question: Consider a quantum experiment designed to investigate time-frequency entanglement. Two photons, A and B, are generated through spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in a type-I crystal. Assume that initially, photon A is in a frequency mode $\\omega_A$ and photon B is in a frequency mode $\\omega_B$. Photon A then passes through an electro-optic modulator (EOM), which applies a time-dependent phase $\\phi(t) = \\alpha \\sin(\\Omega t)$, where $\\alpha$ is the modulation amplitude and $\\Omega$ is the modulation frequency. Assume only the carrier and first-order sidebands contribute significantly to the detected frequencies. Both photons then pass through a symmetric beam splitter with amplitude transmissivity $T$ and amplitude reflectivity $R$, such that $|T|^2+|R|^2=1$. Assuming the frequency difference makes the photons distinguishable at the beam splitter inputs, calculate the probability, $P_{D1,D2}$, of detecting one photon at detector D1 with frequency $\\omega_A + \\Omega$ and the other at detector D2 with frequency $\\omega_B$.

Acousto-optic modulators (AOMs) are used to manipulate the frequencies of photons A and C. The AOMs are configured to shift the frequency to a single new value, such that photon A has frequency $\\omega_A' = \\omega_A + \\Delta \\omega$ and photon C has frequency $\\omega_C' = \\omega_C - \\Delta \\omega$. Photons B and D retain their initial frequencies $\\omega_B$ and $\\omega_D$.

The EOM introduces a sinusoidal phase modulation $\\phi(t) = A \\sin(2\\pi f_m t)$, where $A$ is the modulation index and $f_m$ is the modulation frequency. The signal photon passes directly to a detector D1. The idler photon passes through the EOM and then to detector D2. Both detectors are frequency selective, with D1 only registering photons at the signal frequency $\\omega_s$, and D2 only registering photons at the first-order sideband frequency $\\omega_i + f_m$, where $\\omega_i$ is the original idler frequency.

      "Writing question: In a heavy-ion collision, the measured elliptic flow, $v_2$, of charged particles is affected by both genuine collective flow and non-flow effects such as jet-particle correlations. Assume that the observed $v_2^{obs}$ can be decomposed into a flow component, $v_2^{flow}$, and a non-flow component, $v_2^{non-flow}$, such that $v_2^{obs} = v_2^{flow} + v_2^{non-flow}$. The non-flow component is estimated using a two-particle correlation method, yielding $v_2^{non-flow} = A/\\sqrt{N}$, where $A$ is a constant and $N$ is the number of particles used in the correlation. The observed $v_2$ is measured as a function of centrality, and it is found that $v_2^{obs} = 0.15$ for peripheral collisions with $N = 100$ at a centrality of $C=70$, and $v_2^{obs} = 0.25$ for central collisions with $N = 1000$ at a centrality of $C=10$. Assuming that the true flow component, $v_2^{flow}$, is linear with centrality (i.e. $v_2^{flow}=kC$), determine the flow component of the elliptic flow, $v_2^{flow}$, for a centrality of $50$. Note, for these collisions, $N=500$, and $C$ represents the centrality as a percentage (e.g., $C=70$ means $70\\%$).\n",
      "Writing question: Consider a scenario where the freeze-out temperature, $T$, in a heavy-ion collision fluctuates event-by-event according to a Gaussian distribution with a mean value $\\langle T \\rangle$ and a standard deviation $\\sigma_T$. Furthermore, the transverse flow velocity $\\beta$ fluctuates according to an independent Gaussian distribution with a mean $\\langle \\beta \\rangle$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_\\beta$. A particle with mass $m$ is emitted. Assuming that the particle's transverse momentum distribution follows a Boltzmann distribution in the local rest frame, calculate the relative change in the inverse slope parameter, $\\Delta I/I$, of the transverse momentum spectrum due to these fluctuations. Express your answer in terms of $\\langle T \\rangle$, $\\sigma_T$, $\\langle \\beta \\rangle$, $\\sigma_\\beta$ and $m$. Assume $\\sigma_T \\ll \\langle T \\rangle$ and $\\sigma_\\beta \\ll \\langle \\beta \\rangle$. The inverse slope parameter $I$ is equivalent to the effective temperature, $T_{eff}$, obtained from an exponential fit to $dN/dp_T$ at high $p_T$, where the distribution in the local rest frame is approximately  $dN/p_T dp_T dy \\propto m_T K_1(m_T/T) \\approx \\exp(-m_T/T)$ for large $p_T$ and $m_T = \\sqrt{m^2 + p_T^2}$.\n"
