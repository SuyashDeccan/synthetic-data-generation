        "question": "A monolayer of 1T\u2032-MoTe\u2082 exhibits interband nesting between electron and hole pockets, leading to a charge density wave (CDW) instability. Assume the electron and hole pockets are perfectly circular with radii $k_e$ and $k_h$ respectively, and centered at points separated by a wavevector $\\mathbf{Q}$. The Fermi velocities at the electron and hole pockets are $v_e$ and $v_h$ respectively. Assuming perfect nesting (i.e., the Fermi surfaces align when shifted by $\\mathbf{Q}$), calculate the magnitude of the CDW gap, $\\Delta$, at $T=0$ in terms of the coupling constant $g$ between the electron and hole pockets, the Fermi velocities $v_e$ and $v_h$, and the electronic bandwidth, $W$. You may assume a weak-coupling BCS-like scenario.",

        "question": "Consider a heterostructure consisting of a thin film of a topological material with a unidirectional charge order (CO) placed in proximity to a conventional s-wave superconductor. Assume that interfacial disorder introduces scattering between the Cooper pairs in the superconductor and the CO fluctuations in the topological material. The CO fluctuation amplitude has a typical fluctuation energy scale $\\Omega_{CO}$. The average spacing between scattering centers at the interface is $l$ (where $l$ is also the mean free path), and the superconducting gap is given as $\\Delta_{SC}$. Derive an expression for the critical temperature $T_c$ for superconductivity, assuming $T_c$ is suppressed by the interfacial disorder. Assume the scattering rate is proportional to the density of states at the Fermi level, the square of the ratio of the CO fluctuation energy scale to the superconducting gap, and inversely proportional to the mean free path. Express your answer in terms of $T_{c0}$ (the critical temperature in the absence of scattering), $v_F$ (the Fermi velocity), $l$, $\\Omega_{CO}$, $\\Delta_{SC}$, $\\hbar$, $k_B$ (Boltzmann's constant), and $N(0)$ (the density of states at the Fermi level).

        "question": "A quasi-one-dimensional material exhibits a strong interplay between electron correlation and topology, resulting in the emergence of a pair-density-wave (PDW) state. Suppose the dispersion relation for the electrons is given by $\\epsilon(k) = -2t \\cos(ka)$, where $t$ is the hopping parameter and $a$ is the lattice constant. Due to strong correlations, a Hubbard interaction $U$ is present. In the PDW state, Cooper pairs condense with a finite center-of-mass momentum $Q$. Assume that the PDW order parameter is given by $\\Delta_{PDW}$. Calculate the energy gap at the Fermi level, $E_g$, induced by the PDW order. Assume that $Q=\\pi/a$ and the pairing occurs between electrons with momenta $k$ and $-k + Q$. Use the mean-field Hamiltonian\n$$H_{MF} = \\sum_k \\epsilon(k) c_{k}^\\dagger c_k + \\Delta_{PDW} c_{k}^\\dagger c_{-k+Q}^\\dagger + \\Delta_{PDW}^* c_{-k+Q} c_{k},$$\nand find the eigenvalues of the Bogoliubov\u2013de Gennes equation.
