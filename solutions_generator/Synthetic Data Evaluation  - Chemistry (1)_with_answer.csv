\begin{document}

We are to determine the IUPAC name of the single major alkene formed when $(R)-3-bromo-4-methylhexane$ is treated with excess KOtBu in tert-butanol at 40 °C.

First, we need to identify the reaction. The reaction involves the conversion of an alkene to a more substituted alkene via elimination. In this case, the starting material is $(R)-3-bromo-4-methylhexane$.  The reaction will proceed via E2 elimination.  The reaction with KOtBu in tert-butanol will favor the formation of a more substituted alkene due to the enhanced basicity of the KOtBu reagent.

Step 1:  KOtBu acts as a strong base, removing a proton from the carbon adjacent to the bromine atom. This generates an enolate.

Step 2: The enolate then attacks the carbon bearing the bromine, resulting in elimination of HBr and formation of the alkene. Since the starting material has a bromine atom, the alkene will be a product of E2 elimination.

Step 3: The reaction proceeds through the formation of a carbocation intermediate.

Step 4:  The carbocation is stabilized by the adjacent methyl group, facilitating the formation of the alkene.

Therefore, the major product is $(R)-3-bromo-4-methyl-1-butene$.

**Final Answer:**

$$\boxed{{(R)-3-bromo-4-methyl-1-butene}}$$

\section*{Problem: Stepwise Formation of a Nickel(II) –1,2-Diaminopropane Complex}

We are given the following information:

\begin{itemize}
    \item  [1.] Aqueous solution: [1.00 L], [25°C]
    \item  [2.] [1,2-diaminopropane] is adjusted to [0.120 M]
    \item  [3.] Stepwise formation constants at [25°C]:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  Ni²⁺ + dap \equiv K₁
        \item  Ni(dap)²⁺ + dap \equiv K₂
        \item  Ni(dap)₂²⁺ + dap \equiv K₃
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Calculate the equilibrium concentration of free Ni²⁺ (in M).

\textbf{Step 1:} We need to find the equilibrium concentration of Ni²⁺.  The equilibrium concentration of a species is the concentration of that species at equilibrium. In this case, we want to find the concentration of Ni²⁺.

\textbf{Step 2:} We know that the initial concentration of Ni²⁺ is [1.00 mol] and it is at equilibrium.  The total number of moles of Ni²⁺ is [1.00 mol].  We can use the equilibrium expression for the formation constant to solve for the equilibrium concentration of Ni²⁺.

\textbf{Step 3:}  We can use the equilibrium expression for the formation constant to determine the equilibrium concentration.  The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K = \frac{\Delta[Ni²⁺]}{[Ni²⁺]}
\]

where $\Delta[Ni²⁺]$ is the change in concentration of Ni²⁺. In this case, $\Delta[Ni²⁺] = [0.120 M] - [0.0400 mol] = 0.0800 mol^-1$.

\textbf{Step 4:}  Substitute this value into the equilibrium expression:

\[
3.50 \times 10^6 = \frac{0.0800}{0.0400}
\]

\[
3.50 \times 10^6 = 2.00
\]

Since this equation is not true, the initial concentration of Ni²⁺ is not [1.00 mol].
\end{itemize}

Therefore, the equilibrium concentration of free Ni²⁺ is [1.00 mol].

\boxed{{1.00 mol}}

The assembly has a singlet oxygen quantum yield $(\phi_{\Delta} = 0.65)$. The illuminated intracellular area is estimated as $(1.0 \times 10^{-8}\mathrm{cm}^2)$.  Calculate the singlet oxygen generation rate per cell (molecules $s^{-1}$) assuming all incident photons on this area are absorbed. Use the photon energy formula: $[E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}]$  with Planck\u2019s constant $( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} ;\mathrm{J \cdot s} )$, speed of light $( c = 3.0 \times 10^{8} ; \mathrm{m/s} )$, wavelength $(\lambda = 800; \mathrm{nm})$, and Avogadro's number $( N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} ; \mathrm{mol^{-1}} )$.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
