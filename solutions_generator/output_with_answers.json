        "explanation": "To determine the impurity-averaged quasiparticle density of states $ N(E) $, we begin by analyzing the structure of the problem. The system is a three-dimensional topological superconductor described by a Bogoliubov–de Gennes Hamiltonian, which includes a normal-state density of states $ N_0 $ and a perturbation due to an impurity. This impurity has a scattering strength $ U $, and the goal is to express the impurity-averaged density of states $ N(E) $ in terms of $ U $, $ \\Delta_0 $, and $ N_0 $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Impurity Contribution\n\nThe impurity acts as a point-like scattering source, introducing a scattering term in the Hamiltonian. In the self-consistent Born approximation, the scattering potential is treated as a small perturbation to the normal-state density of states. This scattering leads to a modification in the density of states at the Fermi level.\n\nIn the Born approximation, the scattering amplitude is proportional to the scattering strength. Since the impurity is a point-like scattering, its contribution is localized and small. This implies that the impurity's density of states is a function of the scattering strength $ U $, and we assume that the normal-state density of states $ N_0 $ already accounts for the unperturbed behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Deriving the Impurity-Averaged Density of States\n\nThe total impurity-averaged density of states is given by summing the normal-state density of states and the contribution from the impurity. Since the normal-state density of states already accounts for the unperturbed state, the impurity's contribution becomes a small perturbation in the density of states. This perturbation is proportional to the scattering strength $ U $, and the normal-state density of states already includes the contribution of the impurity.\n\nThus, the impurity-averaged quasiparticle density of states becomes:\n\n$$\nN(E) = N_0 + U \\Delta_0\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{N_0 + U \\Delta_0}\n$$",
