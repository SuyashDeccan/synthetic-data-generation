    "**LaTeX Guidelines:**\n",
    "* **General:** Use LaTeX for ALL mathematical notation. Do not use markdown for any unformatted data.\n",
    "* **Delimiters:** Inline math: `$your_latex$`. Display math (standalone equations on own lines): `$$your_latex$$`. AVOID `\\(..\\)` or `\\[....\\]`.\n",
    "* **Multi-Step Equations:** ALWAYS use `\\begin{aligned} ... \\end{aligned}`. Align with `&` (e.g., `&=`). Each step on a new line using `\\\\\\\\`.\n",
    "* **Punctuation & Spacing:** Grammatically integrate and punctuate all equations. Use `\\,` before terminal punctuation in display equations, between a numerical value and its unit (e.g., `\\mathrm{5\\,kg}`), and as a thousands separator.\n",
    "* **Symbols & Text in Math:** Use LaTeX commands for symbols (e.g., `\\Delta`). For text within math, use `\\text{normal text with spaces}`. For units, descriptive labels, or upright text in math, use `\\mathrm{upright text}` (note: `\\mathrm{}` doesn't auto-space).\n",
    "* **Typeface:** Variables are italic (default). Units and descriptive labels are upright/plaintext. Vectors are bold and italic (e.g., `\\mathbf{v}` or `\\textit{\\textbf{v}}`).\n",
    "* **Units:** Default to SI units unless specified. Format like `\\mathrm{5\\,kg}`.\n",
    "* **Brackets:** Use `\\left( \\right)` and its counterparts for dynamic sizing.\n",
    "* **Final Answers:** Do NOT round calculations. provide the final answer in a boxed format like this:\\boxed{{Your final answer here}}\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "* Provide answers in a step-by-step, tutor-like manner.\n",
    "* Provide answers in ONLY Latex and not markdown, wherever you need fomatting in the answer you should do it using Latex.\n",
    "* Clearly state each step and all assumptions made.\n",
    "* Perform all calculations precisely, without any approximation.\n",
    "* Strictly adhere to all LaTeX Guidelines provided above.\n",

      "**Step 1: Understand the Concepts**\n",
      "\n",
      "A chiral material, due to its permittivity tensor, can induce optical activity. This means that the plane of polarization of light passing through it rotates. The rotation is quantified by the angle $\\theta$.  The permittivity tensor describes the material's response to electric fields, and in this case, the off-diagonal elements are crucial for inducing optical activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 2: Recall the Formula for the Angle of Rotation**\n",
      "\n",
      "The angle of rotation, $\\theta$, is given by the following formula:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\theta = \\frac{\\Delta n \\cdot d}{n}$$\n",
      "\n",

      "We need to calculate $\\Delta n$. The permittivity tensor is given by:\n",

      "This tells us that the permittivity tensor is diagonalizable with eigenvalues $n^2$ and $-n^2$. The eigenvectors (corresponding to the eigenvalues) are related to the polarization direction. The rotation is caused by the difference in the refractive indices experienced by the light polarized along the eigenvectors.  Since we are given that the light beam is initially polarized along the z-axis, we can consider the z-axis as the direction of one eigenvector.  The other eigenvector is then along the x-axis. Therefore, $\\Delta n$ is the difference between the refractive indices for light polarized along the z-axis (the eigenvector corresponding to $n^2$) and light polarized along the x-axis (the eigenvector corresponding to $-n^2$).\n",

Secondly, the interpretation of the -65 dBc/Hz spectral density as a *power* spectral density is correct, but the subsequent calculations are flawed, especially the assumption of a carrier power of 1W without justification.

      "Suyash Question: Consider the exclusive decay $B \\to K^* \\ell^+ \\ell^-$, where $B$ is a $B$ meson, $K^*$ is a $K^*$ meson, and $\\ell^+ \\ell^-$ represents a lepton pair (e.g., $\\mu^+ \\mu^-$). The angular distribution of the decay products can be parameterized in terms of several angular observables, including $F_L$, the fraction of longitudinally polarized $K^*$ mesons, and $A_{FB}$, the forward-backward asymmetry. Assume that the differential decay rate depends on these observables as $\\frac{d\\Gamma}{dq^2 d\\cos\\theta} \\propto F_L(q^2) \\cos^2\\theta + (1-F_L(q^2))\\sin^2\\theta (1 + A_{FB}(q^2) \\cos\\theta)$, where $q^2$ is the dilepton invariant mass squared and $\\theta$ is the angle between the lepton and the $B$ meson in the dilepton rest frame.  Experimental measurements at a certain $q^2 = 4 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}^2$ give $F_L(4 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}^2) = 0.6$ and $A_{FB}(4 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}^2) = 0.2$.

Assume that initially the particle starts at the origin. Obtain result in terms of $D$, $r$, and $\\epsilon$.\n",
      "Suyash First Explanation: Okay, let's tackle this problem step-by-step. This is a classic problem in random walk theory, and we'll use the continuum approximation to derive the Mean First Passage Time (MFPT) to a target within a small circle.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Assumptions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Continuum Approximation:** We assume that the square lattice can be approximated by a continuous random walk, which is valid when the lattice spacing $a$ is small compared to the distance to the target $r$.\n",
      "2.  **Stationary State:** The random walk has reached a stationary state, meaning the probability distribution of the particle's position is time-independent.\n",
      "3.  **Gaussian Distribution:** In the continuum approximation, the particle's position after a sufficiently long time follows a Gaussian distribution.\n",
      "4. **Small circle around target:** We consider a small circle around the target location.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Derivation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Probability Density Function (PDF) of Particle's Position:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   Let $(x, y)$ be the position of the particle after a long time. Since the walk is stationary, the probability density function (PDF) of the particle's position is given by:\n",
      "\n",
      "   $$\n",
      "   p(x, y) = \\frac{1}{4D} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{|x|}{2D} \\right) \\exp\\left( -\\frac{|y|}{2D} \\right)\n",
      "   $$\n",
      "\n",
      "   Where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. This comes from the Gaussian distribution with mean $(0, 0)$ and variance $(D, D)$.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Probability of Reaching the Target Circle:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   We want to find the probability of reaching the target located at $(0, 0)$ within a circle of radius $\\epsilon$ around the origin. Since the target is at the origin, the circle is centered at the origin. We can express this as:\n",

      "   However, since the target is located at the origin, this integral effectively calculates the probability that the particle ends up within a circle of radius $\\epsilon$ centered at the origin after a long time. The Gaussian distribution extends in all directions from the origin, so the probability of ending up within a circle of radius $\\epsilon$ is equal to the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of a larger circle with radius $R$, where $R$ is sufficiently large.  The probability becomes:\n",

      "   $$\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Mean First Passage Time (MFPT):**\n",

The particle has a probability $p=1/2$ of hopping to the right and a probability $1-p=1/2$ of hopping to the left at each time step $\\Delta t$. Assume a target is located at a large distance $r = Na$ from the starting point, where $N$ is a large integer. In the continuum limit, the diffusion coefficient is given by $D = a^2/(2\\Delta t)$. The particle is subject to stochastic resetting to its initial position with a rate $r_0$. Calculate the Mean First Passage Time (MFPT) to the target in the limit of large $r$, assuming the system reaches a stationary non-equilibrium state, and give your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $D$ and $r_0$. You can assume that the particle is initially at the origin and the target is far away ($r \\to \\infty$). Ignore any boundary effects.\n",

      "**Understanding the Problem**\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a particle undergoing random walks on a 1D lattice with a probability of hopping left or right.  We're interested in the Mean First Passage Time (MFPT) to a distant target. The key is to analyze the system in the continuum limit where the diffusion coefficient is given by $D = a^2/(2\\Delta t)$. Also, we're given a stochastic resetting mechanism, meaning the particle returns to its initial position with rate $r_0$. We'll consider a stationary non-equilibrium state.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 1: Defining the MFPT**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mean First Passage Time (MFPT), denoted as $E[\\tau]$, is the average time it takes for the particle to first reach the target.  In this case, we're looking for:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$E[\\tau] = \\frac{1}{P_{\\text{target}}} \\int_0^{\\infty} t \\, \\mathbb{I}(\\text{particle at position } x \\text{ at time } t) \\, dt$$\n",

      "**Step 2:  The Stationary Non-Equilibrium State**\n",
      "\n",
      "The stochastic resetting introduces a non-equilibrium behavior. The particle doesn't simply follow a diffusive trajectory.  The resetting process significantly alters the dynamics.  We are assuming the system reaches a stationary state, meaning the probability distribution of the particle's position evolves over time without further changes. In this stationary state, the particle’s position is governed by the balance between the diffusive tendency and the resetting process.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 3: Analyzing the Dynamics (Continuum Limit)**\n",
      "\n",
      "In the continuum limit, the particle's displacement $x$ at time $t$ follows a Gaussian distribution:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$f(x, t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi D t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{4D t}\\right)$$\n",

      "This represents the probability density function of the particle's position.  This Gaussian distribution is central to understanding the dynamics, as it allows us to compute the mean first passage time.\n",

      "**Step 4:  Calculating the Mean First Passage Time**\n",
      "\n",
      "The MFPT can be calculated using the formula derived for Gaussian random walks:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$E[\\tau] = \\frac{r_0}{D} \\int_0^\\infty t e^{-t/(r_0/D)} dt$$\n",
      "This integral can be evaluated. Let $u = t/(r_0/D)$. Then $t = u \\frac{r_0}{D}$, and $dt = \\frac{r_0}{D} du$.  Substituting:\n",
