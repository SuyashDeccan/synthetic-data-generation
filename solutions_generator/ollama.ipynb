    "**LaTeX Guidelines:**\n",
    "* **General:** Use LaTeX for ALL mathematical notation ONLY. Use Markdown for tables/lists ONLY; other text unformatted must be in plain text.\n",
    "* **Delimiters:** Inline math: `\\\\( your_latex \\\\)`. Display math (standalone equations on own lines): `\\\\[ your_latex \\\\]`. AVOID `$` or `$$`.\n",
    "* **Multi-Step Equations:** ALWAYS use `\\begin{aligned} ... \\end{aligned}`. Align with `&` (e.g., `&=`). Each step on a new line using `\\\\\\\\`.\n",
    "* **Punctuation & Spacing:** Grammatically integrate and punctuate all equations. Use `\\,` before terminal punctuation in display equations, between a numerical value and its unit (e.g., `\\mathrm{5\\,kg}`), and as a thousands separator.\n",
    "* **Symbols & Text in Math:** Use LaTeX commands for symbols (e.g., `\\Delta`). For text within math, use `\\text{normal text with spaces}`. For units, descriptive labels, or upright text in math, use `\\mathrm{upright text}` (note: `\\mathrm{}` doesn't auto-space).\n",
    "* **Typeface:** Variables are italic (default). Units and descriptive labels are upright/plaintext. Vectors are bold and italic (e.g., `\\mathbf{v}` or `\\textit{\\textbf{v}}`).\n",
    "* **Units:** Default to SI units unless specified. Format like `\\mathrm{5\\,kg}`.\n",
    "* **Brackets:** Use `\\left( \\right)` and its counterparts for dynamic sizing.\n",
    "* **Final Answers:** Do NOT round intermediate calculations. Round final answers (default two decimal places unless specified).provide the final answer in a boxed format like this:\\n\\n\\\\boxed{{Your final answer here}}\\n\\n\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "* Provide answers in a step-by-step, tutor-like manner.\n",
    "* Provide answers in ONLY Latex and not markdown, wherever you need fomatting in the answer you should do it using Latex.\n",
    "* Clearly state each step and all assumptions made.\n",
    "* Perform all calculations precisely, without any approximation.\n",
    "* Strictly adhere to all LaTeX Guidelines provided above.\n",
