Target a Solvable Quantity: Ask for a clear symbolic expression of a physical variable (e.g., tension, acceleration, energy). 3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning: Ensure the question involves a sequence of physics laws, transformations, and derivations to reach the answer. 4. Avoid Redundancy: Exclude extraneous details or variables that do not impact the final solution. 5. Be Unique: Do not rephrase standard textbook problems; ensure originality and complexity. 6. Single solution: Expect a single symbolic expression, unambiguous, presented in LaTeX. Multiple equivalent algebraic forms are allowed. No equations or floating-point approximations. 7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing. 8. Avoid colloquial or ambiguous terminology. 9. Units must be consistent; symbols should follow standard notation.\n",
