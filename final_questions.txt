1. One-Loop–Corrected Seesaw Neutrino Mass  
Given the $2\times2$ Majorana mass matrix  
\[
M=\begin{pmatrix}0 & m_D\\ m_D & M_R\end{pmatrix},\qquad M_R\gg m_D,
\]  
and the one-loop self-energy  
\[
\Sigma=\Sigma_h(p^2=M_R^2)+\Sigma_W(p^2=M_R^2),\qquad \Sigma\ll M_R,
\]  
whose tree-level light eigenvalue is $m_D^2/M_R$, find the one-loop–corrected light neutrino mass eigenvalue $m_\nu$ to first order in $\Sigma$.  
Provide  
\[
m_\nu=\dots
\]  
as a single LaTeX expression in terms of $m_D$, $M_R$, and $\Sigma\,$.

2. Matter Mixing Angle with Non-Standard Neutral-Current Interaction  
The two-flavor Hamiltonian in matter is  
\[
H=\frac{\Delta}{2}\bigl(-\cos2\theta\,\sigma_3+\sin2\theta\,\sigma_1\bigr)
+\frac{V_e}{2}(1+\epsilon)\,\sigma_3,
\]  
with $\Delta\equiv\Delta m^2/(2E)$, $V_e$ the standard matter potential, and $|\epsilon|\ll1$. Diagonalize $H$ to obtain the mixing angle $\theta_m$.  
Provide  
\[
\tan2\theta_m=\dots
\]  
as a single LaTeX expression in terms of $\theta$, $\Delta$, $V_e$, and $\epsilon\,$.

3. Cutoff Scale from One- and Two-Loop Higgs Mass Corrections  
The Higgs mass corrections are  
\[
\delta m_H^2{}^{(1)}=-\frac{3\,y_t^2}{8\pi^2}\,\Lambda^2,\qquad
\delta m_H^2{}^{(2)}=\frac{C\,g_s^2\,y_t^2}{16\pi^4}\,\Lambda^2,
\]  
with real positive $y_t$, $g_s$ and $C=\mathcal O(1)$. Define the fine-tuning measure  
\[
\Delta=\frac{\bigl|\delta m_H^2{}^{(1)}+\delta m_H^2{}^{(2)}\bigr|}{m_H^2}\le\Delta_{\max}.
\]  
Solve for the maximal cutoff $\Lambda_{\max}$.  
Provide  
\[
\Lambda_{\max}=\dots
\]  
as a single LaTeX expression in terms of $y_t$, $g_s$, $m_H$, $C$, and $\Delta_{\max}\,$.

4. Short-Baseline Appearance in a 3+1 Model with a CP Phase  
Neglecting $\Delta m^2_{21},\Delta m^2_{31}$ and standard CP phases, the 3+1 appearance probability is  
\[
P_{\mu e}(L)=\biggl|\sum_{i=1}^4U_{\mu i}U^*_{e i}\,e^{-i\,m_i^2L/(2E)}\biggr|^2,
\]  
with $|U_{e4}U_{\mu4}|\ll1$ and a CP phase $\delta_{14}\in(-\pi,\pi]$. Expand $P_{\mu e}(L)$ to leading order in $|U_{e4}U_{\mu4}|$.  
Provide  
\[
P_{\mu e}(L)\approx\dots
\]  
as a single LaTeX expression in terms of $|U_{e4}U_{\mu4}|$, $\delta_{14}$, $\Delta m^2_{41}$, $L$, and $E\,$.

5. Closed-Form Solution of Coupled One-Loop RGEs  
The RGEs are  
\[
\frac{dy}{dt}=a\,y^3+d\,y\,g^2,\quad
\frac{dg}{dt}=-b\,g^3,
\]  
with $t=\ln\mu$, $y(0)=y_0$, $g(0)=g_0$, and $a,b,d>0$. Eliminate $g(t)$, integrate, and express $y(t)$ in closed form.  
Provide  
\[
y(t)=\dots
\]  
in terms of $t$, $y_0$, $g_0$, $a$, $b$, and $d$ (Lambert $W$ allowed).
