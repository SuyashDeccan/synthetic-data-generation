        "question": "A spherical object with radius $r$ is orbiting a distant star at a distance $d$. The star has a radius $R$ and a surface temperature $T_s$. Assume that the object's orbit is much larger than both the object's radius and the star radius, so that the object subtends a small solid angle as seen from the star, and vice versa. Due to imperfect knowledge of the object's albedo, its emissivity, $\\epsilon$, is known only to lie within a range $[\\epsilon_0 - \\delta, \\epsilon_0 + \\delta]$, where $\\delta \\ll \\epsilon_0$. Determine an expression for the equilibrium temperature of the object, $T_{eq}(\\epsilon)$, in terms of $r$, $R$, $T_s$, $d$, $\\epsilon_0$, $\\delta$, and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant $\\sigma_{SB}$.",
