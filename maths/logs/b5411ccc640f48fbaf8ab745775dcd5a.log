Here's a critique of the provided questions against your guidelines:

---

**Question 1:**
Consider the group $SU(2)$ acting on $\mathbb{C}^2$. A vector $v \in \mathbb{C}^2$ is chosen uniformly at random from the unit sphere. Let $g$ be a randomly chosen element from $SU(2)$ according to the Haar measure. What is the expected value of $|\langle v, gv \rangle|^2$, where $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ denotes the standard inner product on $\mathbb{C}^2$?

*   **Critique:** This is a strong question that largely adheres to the guidelines.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Mathematical Structure):** Well-defined setup.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** Asks for a clear symbolic/numeric result.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Requires knowledge of integration over spheres and Lie groups (Haar measure), properties of unitary matrices, and expected values. It requires non-trivial computation, likely involving Schur's Lemma or explicit parametrization.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** While problems involving Haar measure and expectation on groups are common, this specific setup is sufficiently non-trivial to be considered original for an assessment.
*   **Feedback for Improvement:** No significant improvements needed. It's a solid, university-level question.

---

**Question 2:**
Let $G$ be a finitely generated group with a word metric $d$. Suppose the growth function $\gamma(n)$ of $G$ satisfies $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\log \gamma(n)}{\log n} = \alpha$. Define the Hausdorff dimension of $G$ as $HD(G) = \alpha$. Now consider two finitely generated groups $G_1$ and $G_2$ with growth exponents $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ respectively. Assume that $G_1$ and $G_2$ are quasi-isometric. What is the value of $|HD(G_1) - HD(G_2)|$?

*   **Critique:** This question fails on the "Multi-Step Reasoning" guideline.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** The growth exponent (what you've defined as $HD(G)$) is a well-known quasi-isometry invariant. Therefore, if $G_1$ and $G_2$ are quasi-isometric, their growth exponents must be equal ($\alpha_1 = \alpha_2$). The answer is then directly $0$. This tests recall of a fundamental theorem rather than requiring a sequence of algebraic or analytic steps.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** This is a direct application of a standard theorem in geometric group theory, making it less "unique and non-trivial" in terms of problem-solving.
*   **Feedback for Improvement:** To improve, pose a problem where this invariance is a *step* towards a more complex calculation, or where the groups are *not* quasi-isometric and their growth exponents need to be determined and compared. For example, "Determine the growth exponent for two specific, different classes of groups (e.g., a free group and a free abelian group) and calculate the difference." This would require deriving or knowing the growth functions, which involves reasoning.

**Question 3:**
Suppose a solid sphere of radius $R$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is decomposed into a finite number of disjoint sets, $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$, and similarly another solid sphere of radius $r$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is decomposed into disjoint sets $B_1, B_2, \dots, B_n$. Assume that for each $i$, $A_i$ is congruent to $B_i$. Let $V$ be the volume of the sphere of radius $R$ and $v$ be the volume of the sphere of radius $r$. What is the value of $\sqrt[3]{\frac{V}{v}}$?

*   **Critique:** This question also primarily tests recall of a specific theorem rather than multi-step reasoning.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** The condition "for each $i$, $A_i$ is congruent to $B_i$" means that the sphere of radius $R$ is equidecomposable with the sphere of radius $r$. A consequence of the Banach-Tarski paradox (specifically, Tarski's Theorem on Equidecomposability in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \ge 3$) states that two bounded subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with non-empty interior are equidecomposable if and only if they have the same Lebesgue measure (volume). Thus, $V=v$, and the answer is $1$. This is a direct application of a known theorem.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** It's a known implication of the Banach-Tarski paradox.
*   **Feedback for Improvement:** This type of question often falls under "paradoxes" or "foundations of measure theory." To require multi-step reasoning, the question would need to go beyond a direct recall of Tarski's theorem. Perhaps by changing the space or the nature of the decomposition, or by asking for a property that can be derived *from* the paradox but isn't its immediate consequence. For example, "If a solid sphere of radius $R$ can be decomposed and reassembled into two solid spheres of radius $R/2$, what does this imply about the existence of a non-trivial invariant measure for rigid motions?" (though this veers into "proofs"). A question that *requires* understanding of what "congruent" means in the context of non-measurable sets for Banach-Tarski without directly asking for its consequence, but leading to a different calculation, would be stronger.

---

**Question 4:**
Let $G$ be a group acting on a metric space $X$. Suppose this action admits an analytic continuation to a projective space $\mathbb{P}(V)$, where $V$ is a complex vector space. If the action of $G$ preserves a probability measure $\mu$ on $X$, and if for some $x \in X$, the orbit $Gx$ is dense in $X$, determine the value of $\int_X d(x, gx) d\mu(x)$ when $d(x,gx) < \epsilon$ and $g \neq e$, where $e$ is the identity element of $G$.

*   **Critique:** This question is poorly formulated and highly ambiguous, violating multiple guidelines.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Mathematical Structure):** The phrase "action admits an analytic continuation to a projective space $\mathbb{P}(V)$" is extremely vague and unusual in this context. It's unclear what mathematical meaning it conveys or how it relates to the rest of the problem. It seems like a misapplication of terms or unnecessary complexity.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target) & Guideline 4 (Single Output):** The condition "when $d(x,gx) < \epsilon$ and $g \neq e$" is problematic.
        *   The integral is over $X$ (let's call the integration variable $y$), i.e., $\int_X d(y, gy) d\mu(y)$.
        *   The condition "$d(x,gx) < \epsilon$" refers to a *specific* point $x$ (the one whose orbit is dense) and a *specific* element $g$. It's unclear if $g$ is fixed, or if the question implicitly asks for some kind of limit or a property of *all* $g$ satisfying the condition. If $g$ is a fixed element, then the statement "$d(x,gx) < \epsilon$" is just a condition on *that specific $g$*.
        *   If the question implies a choice of $g$ that satisfies the condition, the result would depend on the choice of $g$. This makes the "single unambiguous symbolic answer" difficult or impossible to provide.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** The "analytic continuation" part is almost certainly irrelevant filler. The condition on $g$ is also confusing.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** No clear path for reasoning given the ill-defined nature.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Language and Notation):** The phrase "analytic continuation to a projective space" for a group action on a metric space is not standard.
*   **Feedback for Improvement:** This question needs a complete rehaul.
    1.  Remove all irrelevant information (e.g., "analytic continuation," "projective space").
    2.  Clarify the condition on $g$: Is $g$ fixed? Is it a random variable? Is the integral part of a limit process as $\epsilon \to 0$?
    3.  Ensure the integral is well-defined and leads to a single, unambiguous result. For example, if $g$ is chosen from a subset of $G$ where $d(x,gx) < \epsilon$ for *all* $x \in X$, or if $g$ is chosen from a set of "small" elements.

**Question 5:**
Consider a Banach space $B$. Assume that the Banach-Tarski paradox holds in $B$. If a ball of radius $r$ in $B$ can be decomposed into $n$ pieces and reassembled (using only isometries) into two balls of radius $r$, what is the smallest possible value of $n$?

*   **Critique:** This question fails on the "Multi-Step Reasoning" guideline.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** The question directly asks for a specific number ($n=5$) that is a well-known part of the statement of the Banach-Tarski paradox (specifically, the "doubling a ball" variant). It tests memorization of a result's parameter, not a logical sequence of analytical or algebraic steps.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** This is a textbook fact about the Banach-Tarski paradox.
*   **Feedback for Improvement:** To make this a stronger question, avoid asking for a direct numerical parameter of a theorem. Instead, pose a problem that requires *applying* the implications of the Banach-Tarski paradox to a different scenario or for a different derived quantity. For example, if a solid ball is decomposed into $N$ pieces, and reassembled to form a larger ball, what's the theoretical minimum number of pieces required if specific types of isometries are restricted? (This might be too complex or lead to an unknown result). A more solvable approach would be to relate the paradox to other concepts, requiring a deductive process instead of direct recall.

Here are the refined mathematics questions, addressing the feedback provided:

1.  <question>Consider the group $SU(2)$ acting on $\mathbb{C}^2$. A vector $v \in \mathbb{C}^2$ is chosen uniformly at random from the unit sphere. Let $g$ be a randomly chosen element from $SU(2)$ according to the Haar measure. What is the expected value of $|\langle v, gv \rangle|^2$, where $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ denotes the standard inner product on $\mathbb{C}^2$?</question>

2.  <question>Let $F_2$ be the free group on two generators, and let $\mathbb{Z}^2$ be the free abelian group on two generators. Define a word metric on each group using their standard generating sets.  Let $\gamma_{F_2}(n)$ and $\gamma_{\mathbb{Z}^2}(n)$ be the growth functions of $F_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}^2$, respectively. Calculate $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\log \gamma_{F_2}(n)}{\log \gamma_{\mathbb{Z}^2}(n)}$.</question>

3.  <question>Suppose a solid sphere *S* of radius 1 in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is decomposed into a finite number of disjoint sets, $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$. Assume each $A_i$ is *Lebesgue measurable*. Also suppose there exist isometries $g_1, g_2, ..., g_n$ of $\mathbb{R}^3$ such that the sets $g_1(A_1), g_2(A_2), ..., g_n(A_n)$ are disjoint and their union is a solid sphere *T* of radius *r*. What is the radius *r* of sphere *T*?</question>

4.  <question>Let $X$ be a compact metric space and $G$ a group of isometries of $X$ acting transitively. Suppose $G$ preserves a Borel probability measure $\mu$ on $X$. Let $d(x, y)$ denote the distance between points $x$ and $y$ in $X$.  Prove that for any $x_0 \in X$, the integral $\int_X d(x, x_0) d\mu(x)$ is independent of the choice of $x_0$. Then, assuming $X$ is the unit circle in $\mathbb{C}$ with the standard metric and $\mu$ is normalized Lebesgue measure, compute this integral.</question>

5.  <question>Suppose the Banach-Tarski paradox holds in a Banach space $B$. A ball of radius 1 in $B$ is decomposed into a finite number of sets, and these sets are then rearranged via isometries to form two solid balls.  If one of the two resulting balls has radius 1/2, what is the radius of the other ball?</question>

**Question 2: Growth functions of Free Groups**

*   **Guideline 1 (Input Format):** Met.
*   **Guideline 2 (Mathematical Structure):** Met.
*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** Met. It asks for a limit, which is a clear symbolic/numeric result.
*   **Guideline 4 (Single Output):** Met.
*   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** Met.
*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Not met. The growth functions of $F_2$ (exponential) and $\mathbb{Z}^2$ (polynomial) are standard, well-known results in geometric group theory. The calculation of this limit is a direct application of these known facts.
    *   **Feedback:** To improve originality and multi-step reasoning, consider using groups with more complex or less immediately obvious growth functions, or ask for a property related to growth that requires more derivation (e.g., specific constants in the asymptotic growth, or for a group whose growth function isn't immediately obvious).
*   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Not met. While it involves definitions, the core steps are recalling the known growth functions for these specific, standard groups, and then performing a very simple limit calculation. It doesn't require a significant sequence of analytical steps beyond recalling standard results.
    *   **Feedback:** Design a problem where the growth function itself, or the specific form needed for the limit, requires actual derivation or more involved algebraic/analytic manipulation from first principles or given properties, rather than being a direct recall.

---

**Question 3: Banach-Tarski with Lebesgue Measurable sets**

*   **Guideline 1 (Input Format):** Met.
*   **Guideline 2 (Mathematical Structure):** Not met. The setup is fundamentally contradictory. If the sets $A_i$ are Lebesgue measurable, then isometries preserve their measure, and the union of disjoint sets has the sum of their measures. This implies the volume of $S$ must equal the volume of $T$. The Banach-Tarski paradox relies on the sets *not* being Lebesgue measurable. Presenting this as a standard problem to be solved numerically without addressing the contradiction makes it a trick question, which deviates from "well-defined setup" and "avoid puzzle-like scenarios" for a typical assessment.
    *   **Feedback:** Rephrase the question to avoid the contradiction. For example, remove the "Lebesgue measurable" constraint (though this would change the nature of the problem from a measurable perspective), or ask *what can be concluded* about $r$ given the measurability, or ask about a context where volume *is* preserved. As it stands, the "answer" is conceptual: $r=1$ because volume must be conserved, or the scenario is impossible.
*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** Met, it asks for $r$. However, the solvability is based on recognizing the contradiction, not on standard computation.
*   **Guideline 4 (Single Output):** Met.
*   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** Met, if the intent is to highlight the measure theory contradiction.
*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Not met. This is a very common conceptual question or "gotcha" related to the Banach-Tarski paradox and its reliance on non-measurable sets.
    *   **Feedback:** Formulate a problem that requires computation or derivation using measure theory principles in a non-contradictory setting, rather than testing knowledge of this specific paradox's nuances.
*   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Not met. The solution is a single conceptual step: "Isometries preserve Lebesgue measure, and volume is additive for disjoint measurable sets; therefore, the volume must be conserved, making $r=1$." This is not a "logical sequence of algebraic or analytic steps" but a direct application of a foundational principle.
    *   **Feedback:** Design a problem that requires actual integration, measure calculations, or manipulation of sets under transformations to derive a numerical result.

**Question 4: Integral independence and computation**

*   **Guideline 1 (Input Format):** Met.
*   **Guideline 2 (Mathematical Structure):** Met.
*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** Not met. The question explicitly asks to "Prove that...", which violates the guideline "Questions must not be proves or derivations."
    *   **Feedback:** To align with the guideline, remove the "Prove that" part. Instead of asking for a proof, you could phrase it as "What is the value of the integral $\int_X d(x, x_0) d\mu(x)$ if $X$ is the unit circle in $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mu$ is normalized Lebesgue measure?" This implicitly requires the independence property to solve for a general $x_0$.
*   **Guideline 4 (Single Output):** Not met. The question has two distinct parts: a proof and a computation. The guideline states "Questions must not have multiple parts to answer, there should be only one single solution to each question."
    *   **Feedback:** Split this into two separate questions if both aspects are desired, or, preferably, choose one type of task per question as per the guidelines (e.g., only ask for the computation).
*   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** Met, for the information provided.
*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Met. While the first part is a known result/exercise, the specific combined problem requires a non-trivial computation in a well-defined setting.
*   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Met. Both the proof and the computation would require a sequence of steps.
*   **Guideline 8 (Solution Formatting):** Met.
*   **Guideline 9 (Language and Notation):** Met.
*   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Not met. As stated above, it has two distinct parts.
    *   **Feedback:** Ensure questions are atomic, requesting only one specific type of output.
*   **Guideline 11 (No Answers/Hints):** Met.
*   **Guideline 12 (No Approximations):** Met.

**Question 5: Banach-Tarski in a Banach space**

*   **Guideline 1 (Input Format):** Met.
*   **Guideline 2 (Mathematical Structure):** Not met. Similar to Question 3, this question is based on the Banach-Tarski paradox, which implies that the sets are non-measurable, and conventional notions of volume or radius are not conserved. The paradox typically states that a ball can be decomposed and reassembled into *two copies of the original ball* (i.e., two balls of radius 1 if the original was radius 1). The premise "If one of the two resulting balls has radius 1/2" contradicts the usual statement of the paradox or introduces an arbitrary scaling that makes standard mathematical reasoning about volume/radius inapplicable. This makes it a conceptual puzzle rather than a solvable problem requiring traditional mathematical methods.
    *   **Feedback:** Avoid questions that rely on mathematical paradoxes if the expectation is a numerical answer derived from standard mathematical principles like volume conservation. If the intent is to test understanding of the paradox, rephrase to ask about the implications or impossibility of such a decomposition in a measure-theoretic context.
*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** Met, it asks for a radius. However, the "solution" is conceptual and depends on understanding the paradox's implications (e.g., if one is 1/2, the other would also be 1/2 under a "rescaling" interpretation, or it's simply ill-posed if the original was radius 1).
*   **Guideline 4 (Single Output):** Met.
*   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** Met, if the intent is to highlight the paradox.
*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Not met. This is another variation of a classic conceptual question concerning the Banach-Tarski paradox.
    *   **Feedback:** Design a problem that requires computation or derivation using concepts from functional analysis or Banach spaces in a context where standard mathematical operations (like volume or dimension) are well-behaved.
*   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Not met. The "solution" relies on a single conceptual understanding of the Banach-Tarski paradox (that it allows for non-volume-preserving transformations, typically forming two *identical* copies of the original object). It does not involve a sequence of algebraic or analytic steps.
    *   **Feedback:** Formulate a problem that requires applying definitions, identities, or theorems from Banach space theory or functional analysis to derive a numeric or symbolic result.
*   **Guideline 8 (Solution Formatting):** Met.
*   **Guideline 9 (Language and Notation):** Met.
*   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Met.
*   **Guideline 11 (No Answers/Hints):** Met.
*   **Guideline 12 (No Approximations):** Met.
