1.  <question>Consider a linear inverse problem where we aim to recover a signal $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ from noisy measurements $y = Ax + w$, where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is a known measurement matrix and $w \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I_m)$ is Gaussian noise. Suppose $A$ is a random Gaussian matrix with i.i.d. entries drawn from $\mathcal{N}(0, 1/m)$. We employ a Bayesian approach with a prior distribution on $x$ given by $x \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \tau^2 I_n)$. The posterior distribution is then Gaussian, $p(x|y) \propto \exp(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\|y - Ax\|_2^2 - \frac{1}{2\tau^2}\|x\|_2^2)$. What is the conditional mean of $x$ given $y$, i.e., $\mathbb{E}[x|y]$, expressed in terms of $A$, $y$, $\sigma^2$, and $\tau^2$?</question>

2.  <question>Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ be a sensing matrix used in a compressed sensing framework. Assume that $A$ satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP) of order $k$ with RIP constant $\delta_k$, meaning that for any $k$-sparse vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $(1 - \delta_k)\|x\|_2^2 \leq \|Ax\|_2^2 \leq (1 + \delta_k)\|x\|_2^2$. Consider noisy measurements $y = Ax + w$, where $w \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is bounded noise such that $\|w\|_2 \leq \epsilon$.  Suppose we recover an estimate $\hat{x}$ by solving the $\ell_1$-minimization problem $\hat{x} = \arg\min_z \|z\|_1 \text{ subject to } \|Az - y\|_2 \leq \epsilon$.  Given that $x$ is $k$-sparse, find an upper bound on the $\ell_2$ error $\|x - \hat{x}\|_2$ in terms of $\delta_{2k}$, $\epsilon$, and the entries of $x$.</question>

3.  <question>Consider a sparse signal recovery problem where $y = Ax + w$, with $y \in \mathbb{R}^m$, $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ being $k$-sparse, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ a measurement matrix, and $w \in \mathbb{R}^m$ additive Gaussian noise with covariance $\sigma^2 I_m$.  Suppose we use a Lasso estimator to recover $x$, defined as $\hat{x} = \arg\min_z \frac{1}{2}\|y - Az\|_2^2 + \lambda \|z\|_1$, where $\lambda > 0$ is a regularization parameter. Assume that $m < n$. Assuming the restricted eigenvalue condition holds, what is the order of the regularization parameter $\lambda$ that yields the minimax optimal error rate in estimating $x$ as a function of $m, n, k$ and $\sigma^2$.</question>

4.  <question>Consider a machine learning setting where we want to learn a function $f: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ from samples drawn from a distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over $\mathcal{X}$. Suppose we use a hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$ of functions, and we measure the complexity of $\mathcal{H}$ using its Rademacher complexity $\mathcal{R}_n(\mathcal{H})$. Let $\epsilon > 0$ be an error parameter and $\delta \in (0, 1)$ be a confidence parameter. Assuming that the loss function is bounded between 0 and 1, what is the sample complexity (i.e., the number of samples $n$ needed) to ensure that with probability at least $1 - \delta$, the generalization error of any $h \in \mathcal{H}$ is at most $\epsilon$? Express your answer in terms of $\mathcal{R}_n(\mathcal{H})$, $\epsilon$, and $\delta$.</question>

5.  <question>Consider the problem of recovering a low-rank matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ from a subset of its entries. We observe the entries $X_{ij}$ for $(i, j) \in \Omega$, where $\Omega$ is a set of indices. We want to find the matrix $\hat{X}$ that minimizes the nuclear norm (trace norm) subject to the constraint that the observed entries of $\hat{X}$ match the observed entries of $X$. Suppose that $|\Omega| = m$ and we have noisy observations $Y_{ij} = X_{ij} + W_{ij}$ for $(i, j) \in \Omega$ where $W_{ij}$ are independent and identically distributed Gaussian random variables with mean 0 and variance $\sigma^2$. Let $P_\Omega(Z)$ be the projection of a matrix $Z$ onto the entries in $\Omega$, i.e., $(P_\Omega(Z))_{ij} = Z_{ij}$ if $(i, j) \in \Omega$ and 0 otherwise. Consider the following convex optimization problem: $\hat{X} = \arg\min_Z \|Z\|_* \text{ subject to } \|P_\Omega(Z - Y)\|_F \leq \delta$, where $\| \cdot \|_*$ is the nuclear norm and $\| \cdot \|_F$ is the Frobenius norm. If $X$ has rank $r$, what is the order of the sample complexity $m$ (number of observed entries) required to accurately recover $X$ up to a Frobenius norm error of $\epsilon$, i.e., $\|X - \hat{X}\|_F \leq \epsilon$ with high probability, expressed in terms of $n$, $r$, and $\epsilon$? </question>

Critique:

**Question 1:**
*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** This question asks for a very standard result in Bayesian linear regression (the mean of the posterior for a Gaussian-Gaussian setup). It is a direct textbook derivation.
*   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** The detail "Suppose $A$ is a random Gaussian matrix with i.i.d. entries drawn from $\mathcal{N}(0, 1/m)$" is not strictly necessary for finding the conditional mean *given the explicit form of the posterior*. It provides context but no information essential for the derivation of the conditional mean itself.
**Actionable Feedback:**
*   To enhance originality, consider modifying the problem with a different prior (e.g., one that induces sparsity like a Laplace prior) or a slightly altered noise model, which would require a non-standard calculation.
*   Remove the sentence "Suppose $A$ is a random Gaussian matrix with i.i.d. entries drawn from $\mathcal{N}(0, 1/m)$" as it is redundant given that the posterior distribution's proportionality is already explicitly provided.

**Question 2:**
*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** The question asks for a well-known theoretical bound in compressed sensing (recovery error under RIP and $\ell_1$-minimization). This is a standard result found in research papers and advanced textbooks.
*   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** While the derivation of this bound is complex, the question, as phrased, asks for *the* bound, which primarily assesses recall rather than requiring a logical sequence of algebraic or analytic steps *to produce the bound*.
*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** Asking to "find an upper bound" could imply a derivation, which conflicts with "Questions must not be proves or derivations." If it asks for *the* known bound, it's recall, not derivation.
*   **Guideline 9 (Language and Notation):** The phrase "and the entries of $x$" is unusual. For a $k$-sparse $x$, the $\ell_2$ error bound typically depends on $k$, $\delta_{2k}$, and $\epsilon$, but not the individual entries of $x$ (beyond its sparsity). This part is likely incorrect for the expected form of the bound.
**Actionable Feedback:**
*   Modify the question to require the application of compressed sensing principles to a specific, slightly altered scenario, rather than direct recall of a fundamental recovery bound. For instance, ask for a consequence of the RIP on a different quantity, or a specific numerical outcome under given parameters (if G12 allows for numerical results).
*   Clarify or remove "and the entries of $x$" from the requested terms for the upper bound.

**Question 3:**
*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** This question asks for the minimax optimal order of the Lasso regularization parameter, which is a standard theoretical result in high-dimensional statistics and sparse recovery.
*   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Similar to Question 2, this primarily tests recall of a complex theoretical result's order, rather than requiring multi-step algebraic or analytic derivation.
**Actionable Feedback:**
*   To enhance originality and multi-step reasoning, reformulate the question to involve a novel combination of concepts or a slightly different objective, requiring derivation based on first principles or simpler known bounds, rather than simply stating a well-known order.

**Question 4:**
*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** This asks for a direct statement of a fundamental generalization bound in machine learning theory, based on Rademacher complexity. It is a standard result found in learning theory textbooks.
*   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** As with Questions 2 and 3, this mainly tests the recall of a theoretical result, not a multi-step derivation or application in a novel way.
**Actionable Feedback:**
*   To improve, alter the scenario slightly or ask for an implication or a specific condition derived from the bound, rather than the general sample complexity formula itself. For example, ask about the relationship between two different complexity measures, or how the number of samples scales for a specific type of hypothesis class (e.g., linear models).

**Question 5:**
*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** This question requests the sample complexity for low-rank matrix recovery via nuclear norm minimization, which is a cornerstone result in matrix completion theory. It's a standard theoretical bound.
*   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Similar to the previous questions, this assesses knowledge of a well-established theoretical result rather than requiring multi-step algebraic or analytic derivation from first principles.
**Actionable Feedback:**
*   To increase originality and require more reasoning, modify the problem setting (e.g., non-Gaussian noise, structured missing entries, a variant of the nuclear norm, or asking for the optimal choice of $\delta$ given $\sigma$). This would necessitate applying underlying theoretical understanding in a less direct manner than simply recalling the main sample complexity bound.

Okay, here's a refined set of questions, addressing the feedback provided, aiming for originality and requiring more multi-step reasoning, while still conforming to the general guidelines (without generating proofs).

1.  <question>Consider a linear inverse problem $y = Ax + w$ where $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $y \in \mathbb{R}^m$, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is a known measurement matrix, and $w \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I_m)$ is Gaussian noise. Instead of a Gaussian prior, assume $x$ has a Laplace prior, $p(x) \propto \exp(-\|x\|_1 / \tau)$.  While the posterior is no longer Gaussian, we can still approximate the conditional mean.  Assuming $A^T A$ is invertible, derive an expression for the *stationary points* of the posterior distribution $p(x|y)$, expressed in terms of $A$, $y$, $\sigma^2$, $\tau$, and the subdifferential of the $\ell_1$ norm, $\partial \|x\|_1$.</question>

2.  <question>Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ be a sensing matrix and assume that it satisfies the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) of order $2k$ with constant $\delta_{2k} < 1/3$.  We observe $y = Ax + w$, where $x$ is $k$-sparse and $\|w\|_2 \leq \epsilon$. Instead of standard $\ell_1$ minimization, consider a modified recovery scheme: first, find an initial estimate $\tilde{x}$ using least squares (i.e., $\tilde{x} = A^\dagger y$, where $A^\dagger$ is the pseudoinverse of $A$). Then, project $\tilde{x}$ onto the set of $k$-sparse vectors to obtain $\hat{x}$. Give an upper bound on the quantity $\|A(x - \hat{x})\|_2$ in terms of $\epsilon$, $\delta_{2k}$, and the $k$ largest entries of $x$. Note this asks about a bound on the *residual* error, not the recovery error itself, under a non-standard recovery scheme.</question>

3.  <question>Consider a sparse signal recovery problem where $y = Ax + w$, with $y \in \mathbb{R}^m$, $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ being $k$-sparse, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, and $w \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I_m)$. We use the Lasso estimator $\hat{x} = \arg\min_z \frac{1}{2}\|y - Az\|_2^2 + \lambda \|z\|_1$.  Suppose, instead of minimizing the MSE, we want to minimize the prediction error on *new, unseen data*. Assume we have access to a matrix $A_{new} \in \mathbb{R}^{m' \times n}$ from the same distribution as A.  Assuming the restricted eigenvalue condition holds, and given that we choose $\lambda \asymp \sigma \sqrt{\frac{\log n}{m}}$, derive an upper bound on the expected prediction error $\mathbb{E}[\|A_{new}x - A_{new}\hat{x}\|_2^2]$ for a single new data point, explicitly showing how the sparsity $k$ affects the final result.</question>

4.  <question>Consider a machine learning setting with hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$ and Rademacher complexity $\mathcal{R}_n(\mathcal{H})$. The loss function is bounded between 0 and 1. Suppose we have *two* hypothesis classes, $\mathcal{H}_1$ and $\mathcal{H}_2$, with Rademacher complexities $\mathcal{R}_n(\mathcal{H}_1)$ and $\mathcal{R}_n(\mathcal{H}_2)$, respectively. We form a new hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}_3 = \{h_1 + h_2 : h_1 \in \mathcal{H}_1, h_2 \in \mathcal{H}_2\}$. How does the sample complexity needed to achieve generalization error $\epsilon$ with confidence $1-\delta$ using $\mathcal{H}_3$ compare to the sample complexities using $\mathcal{H}_1$ and $\mathcal{H}_2$ separately? Qualitatively explain the relationship, focusing on the impact of Rademacher complexity, but don't derive the precise sample complexity for $\mathcal{H}_3$. (Hint: You need to know how Rademacher complexity behaves under addition of function classes.)</question>

5.  <question>Consider recovering a low-rank matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ from noisy entries $Y_{ij} = X_{ij} + W_{ij}$ for $(i, j) \in \Omega$, where $|\Omega| = m$ and $W_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$. Let $P_\Omega$ be the projection onto $\Omega$. We use nuclear norm minimization: $\hat{X} = \arg\min_Z \|Z\|_* \text{ subject to } \|P_\Omega(Z - Y)\|_F \leq \delta$.  Assume $X$ has rank $r$. Given that $\delta$ needs to be chosen appropriately, how does the optimal choice of $\delta$ scale with $\sigma$ and $m$? What is the smallest value of $\delta$ that would still allow for recovery? Explain your reasoning. Do *not* state the known error bound; focus on the *choice* of the constraint parameter $\delta$ in relation to the noise level.</question>

Here's a critique of each question based on the provided guidelines:

**General Feedback:**
The questions demonstrate a strong understanding of advanced mathematical concepts and aim for multi-step reasoning, which aligns well with Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning) and Guideline 9 (Language and Notation). However, there are consistent violations across multiple questions related to the type of output expected, the number of outputs, and the inclusion of conversational elements or instructions.

---

**1. Question 1:**
*   **Violation of Guideline 3 (Solvable Target / No proofs or derivations):** The phrase "derive an expression for the stationary points" directly asks for a derivation, which is forbidden by the guideline "Questions must not be proves or derivations."
*   **Violation of Guideline 11 (Only questions should be generated):** "While the posterior is no longer Gaussian, we can still approximate the conditional mean." This sentence provides contextual explanation rather than being a direct part of the question. Remove it for conciseness.

**2. Question 2:**
*   **Minor Violation of Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant) & 11 (Only questions should be generated):** "Note this asks about a bound on the *residual* error, not the recovery error itself, under a non-standard recovery scheme." This is an explanatory note. While it clarifies the scope, it acts as a hint/instruction within the question, violating conciseness and the "only questions" rule. It should either be integrated into the problem statement or removed.

**3. Question 3:**
*   **Violation of Guideline 3 (Solvable Target / No proofs or derivations):** Similar to Question 1, "derive an upper bound" asks for a derivation, violating the "Questions must not be proves or derivations" rule.
*   **Violation of Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant) & 11 (Only questions should be generated):** "explicitly showing how the sparsity $k$ affects the final result." This is an instruction on how the answer should be formatted or what it should highlight, not part of the core problem statement. Remove it.

**4. Question 4:**
*   **Major Violation of Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** The question asks "How does the sample complexity... compare...?" and "Qualitatively explain the relationship...", which do not request a "clear symbolic result" or "closed-form expression." It asks for a conceptual comparison and explanation.
*   **Major Violation of Guideline 4 (Single Output) & 10 (No multiple parts):** The question clearly asks for two distinct things: a comparison and a qualitative explanation.
*   **Major Violation of Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant) & 11 (Only questions should be generated):** The latter part ("Qualitatively explain the relationship...", "but don't derive the precise sample complexity...", "Hint: You need to know...") is highly conversational, provides instructions, and includes a hint. This significantly violates the "only questions" and conciseness rules.

**5. Question 5:**
*   **Major Violation of Guideline 4 (Single Output) & 10 (No multiple parts):** The question asks two distinct things: "how does the optimal choice of $\delta$ scale with $\sigma$ and $m?"$ and "What is the smallest value of $\delta$ that would still allow for recovery?". This requires two separate answers.
*   **Major Violation of Guideline 3 (Solvable Target / No proofs or derivations):** "Explain your reasoning." explicitly asks for an explanation/derivation, violating the "Questions must not be proves or derivations" rule.
*   **Major Violation of Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant) & 11 (Only questions should be generated):** "Explain your reasoning." and "Do *not* state the known error bound; focus on the *choice* of the constraint parameter $\delta$ in relation to the noise level." are instructions, explanations, and hints. These are conversational and violate the "only questions" and conciseness rules.

Here's a revised set of questions, aiming for originality and requiring more multi-step reasoning, while strictly adhering to the provided guidelines (no proofs, derivations, explanations, instructions, hints, conversational elements, multiple outputs, or open-ended "how does... compare" questions). Each question seeks a clear symbolic result or a well-defined numerical value.

1.  <question>Consider a linear inverse problem $y = Ax + w$ where $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $y \in \mathbb{R}^m$, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is a known measurement matrix, and $w \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I_m)$ is Gaussian noise. Assume $x$ has a Laplace prior, $p(x) \propto \exp(-\|x\|_1 / \tau)$. Assuming $A^T A$ is invertible, express the condition for a vector $x^*$ to be a stationary point of the posterior distribution $p(x|y)$ using $A$, $y$, $\sigma^2$, $\tau$, and the subdifferential of the $\ell_1$ norm, $\partial \|x\|_1$. The condition should be expressed as an equation involving these quantities.</question>

2.  <question>Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ be a sensing matrix satisfying the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) of order $2k$ with constant $\delta_{2k} < 1/3$. We observe $y = Ax + w$, where $x$ is $k$-sparse and $\|w\|_2 \leq \epsilon$. Consider the following recovery scheme: $\tilde{x} = A^\dagger y$, where $A^\dagger$ is the pseudoinverse of $A$, and $\hat{x}$ is the projection of $\tilde{x}$ onto the set of $k$-sparse vectors. Provide an upper bound on $\|A(x - \hat{x})\|_2$ expressed as $C_1 \epsilon + C_2 \delta_{2k} \|x_{T^c}\|_1$, determining the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$, where $T$ is the support of the $k$ largest entries of x.</question>

3.  <question>Consider a sparse signal recovery problem where $y = Ax + w$, with $y \in \mathbb{R}^m$, $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ being $k$-sparse, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, and $w \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I_m)$. We use the Lasso estimator $\hat{x} = \arg\min_z \frac{1}{2}\|y - Az\|_2^2 + \lambda \|z\|_1$, with $\lambda = C\sigma \sqrt{\frac{\log n}{m}}$ for some constant C.  Assuming the restricted eigenvalue condition holds, and that $A_{new} \in \mathbb{R}^{m' \times n}$ is a new data matrix from the same distribution as A, find the tightest upper bound of the form $C'k\frac{\log n}{m}\sigma^2$ on the expected prediction error $\mathbb{E}[\|A_{new}x - A_{new}\hat{x}\|_2^2]$ for a single new data point, determining the constant C'.</question>

4.  <question>Consider two hypothesis classes, $\mathcal{H}_1$ and $\mathcal{H}_2$, with Rademacher complexities $\mathcal{R}_n(\mathcal{H}_1)$ and $\mathcal{R}_n(\mathcal{H}_2)$, respectively. Define $\mathcal{H}_3 = \{h_1 + h_2 : h_1 \in \mathcal{H}_1, h_2 \in \mathcal{H}_2\}$. Assuming that Rademacher complexity of sum of function classes satisfy $\mathcal{R}_n(\mathcal{H}_1 + \mathcal{H}_2) \le \mathcal{R}_n(\mathcal{H}_1) + \mathcal{R}_n(\mathcal{H}_2)$, by how much does the sample complexity bound for generalization error $\epsilon$ with confidence $1-\delta$ using $\mathcal{H}_3$ increase compared to the *smaller* sample complexity bound obtained using either $\mathcal{H}_1$ or $\mathcal{H}_2$ individually? Give the increase in terms of $\mathcal{R}_n(\mathcal{H}_1)$ , $\mathcal{R}_n(\mathcal{H}_2)$, $\epsilon$, and $\delta$. (Assume the loss function is bounded between 0 and 1).</question>

5.  <question>Consider recovering a low-rank matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ from noisy entries $Y_{ij} = X_{ij} + W_{ij}$ for $(i, j) \in \Omega$, where $|\Omega| = m$ and $W_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$. Let $P_\Omega$ be the projection onto $\Omega$. We use nuclear norm minimization: $\hat{X} = \arg\min_Z \|Z\|_* \text{ subject to } \|P_\Omega(Z - Y)\|_F \leq \delta$.  Assuming $X$ has rank $r$, what is the *minimum* value of $\delta$ that would generally be required to allow for recovery, expressed as a multiple $C\sigma\sqrt{m}$ of $\sigma\sqrt{m}$? Provide the constant C.</question>
