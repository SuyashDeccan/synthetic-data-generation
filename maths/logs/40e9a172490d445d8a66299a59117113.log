Here are some novel university-level mathematics questions, based on the provided topics, concepts, and guidelines:

1.  <question>Consider a generalized space-time constructed using Colombeau algebras, where the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$ contains singularities. Let $u(x)$ be a solution to a differential equation defined on this space-time, and assume $u(x)$ admits a representation as a hypersequence $\{u_\epsilon(x)\}_{\epsilon \in (0,1)}$ in the Colombeau algebra. If the singular behavior of $g_{\mu\nu}$ is characterized by a parameter $\alpha > 0$ such that the metric can be locally represented as $g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu}$, where $\eta_{\mu\nu}$ is the Minkowski metric and $h_{\mu\nu}$ is a perturbation satisfying $|h_{\mu\nu}| \leq C |x|^{-\alpha}$ for some constant $C$, determine the asymptotic behavior of the hypersequence $\{u_\epsilon(x)\}_{\epsilon \in (0,1)}$ as $\epsilon \to 0$, assuming that $u_\epsilon(x)$ satisfies the equation $\partial_\mu(\sqrt{-g}\ g^{\mu\nu} \partial_\nu u_\epsilon(x)) = 0$ and possesses an asymptotic expansion of the form $u_\epsilon(x) = u_0(x) + \epsilon u_1(x) + O(\epsilon^2)$. Find an expression for $u_0(x)$ in terms of $\alpha$, $C$, and the boundary conditions of the problem.</question>

2.  <question>Let $\mathcal{G}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ be a Colombeau algebra of generalized functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Consider a non-linear partial differential equation with singularities, given by $F(x, u(x), \partial u(x), \partial^2 u(x)) = 0$, where $u(x) \in \mathcal{G}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Suppose that the equation admits a distributional solution $u_0(x)$ which belongs to $H^s(\mathbb{R}^n)$, a Sobolev space with regularity $s < 0$. Given an embedding theorem that relates the Colombeau algebra $\mathcal{G}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to a scale of Sobolev spaces, find a condition on the regularity index $s$ that ensures the existence of an embedding $H^s(\mathbb{R}^n) \hookrightarrow \mathcal{G}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Express this condition in terms of the mollifier used in the construction of the Colombeau algebra, and determine the minimum value of $s$ for which such an embedding is guaranteed to exist.</question>

3.  <question>Consider a differential equation of the form $x^2 y''(x) + x p(x) y'(x) + q(x) y(x) = 0$, where $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are analytic functions at $x=0$. Let $p(0) = p_0$ and $q(0) = q_0$. If the indicial equation $r(r-1) + p_0 r + q_0 = 0$ has roots $r_1$ and $r_2$ such that $r_1 - r_2 = N$, where $N$ is a non-negative integer, and assuming that the method of Frobenius yields two linearly independent solutions of the form $y_1(x) = x^{r_1} \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n$ and $y_2(x) = x^{r_2} \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n x^n + C y_1(x) \ln(x)$, derive an expression for the constant $C$ in terms of the coefficients $a_n$ and $b_n$ and the functions $p(x)$ and $q(x)$.</question>

4.  <question>Let $\{u_n\}$ be a hypersequence of smooth functions converging to a distribution $u$ in the sense of Colombeau algebras. Assume that each $u_n$ satisfies a partial differential equation with singular coefficients, specifically, consider the equation $a(x) \partial_x u_n(x) + b(x) u_n(x) = f_n(x)$, where $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ are distributions belonging to a Colombeau algebra and admitting singular behavior near $x=0$. Suppose that the equation is solved using a fixed point theorem adapted for hypersequences. If the fixed point operator $T$ associated with the differential equation satisfies the contraction mapping property with respect to a suitable metric $d$ defined on the space of hypersequences, and if $\{f_n\}$ is a Cauchy hypersequence converging to $f$ in the Colombeau algebra, determine an expression for the limit $u$ of the hypersequence $\{u_n\}$ in terms of the fixed point $u^*$ of the operator $T$, assuming that $u^*$ is a solution in the Colombeau sense.</question>

Here's a critique of each question based on the provided guidelines, with actionable feedback for improvement:

**Question 1:**
"<question>Consider a generalized space-time constructed using Colombeau algebras, where the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$ contains singularities. Let $u(x)$ be a solution to a differential equation defined on this space-time, and assume $u(x)$ admits a representation as a hypersequence $\{u_\epsilon(x)\}_{\epsilon \in (0,1)}$ in the Colombeau algebra. If the singular behavior of $g_{\mu\nu}$ is characterized by a parameter $\alpha > 0$ such that the metric can be locally represented as $g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu}$, where $\eta_{\mu\nu}$ is the Minkowski metric and $h_{\mu\nu}$ is a perturbation satisfying $|h_{\mu\nu}| \leq C |x|^{-\alpha}$ for some constant $C$, determine the asymptotic behavior of the hypersequence $\{u_\epsilon(x)\}_{\epsilon \in (0,1)}$ as $\epsilon \to 0$, assuming that $u_\epsilon(x)$ satisfies the equation $\partial_\mu(\sqrt{-g}\ g^{\mu\nu} \partial_\nu u_\epsilon(x)) = 0$ and possesses an asymptotic expansion of the form $u_\epsilon(x) = u_0(x) + \epsilon u_1(x) + O(\epsilon^2)$. Find an expression for $u_0(x)$ in terms of $\alpha$, $C$, and the boundary conditions of the problem.</question>"

*   **Violations:**
    *   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target - not proofs/derivations):** While asking for an "expression" is typically acceptable, the complexity of setting up and solving for $u_0(x)$ in this context, involving perturbation theory in Colombeau algebras, borders on a "derivation" rather than a direct calculation. Finding $u_0(x)$ would involve substituting the expansion, expanding the metric, and performing a non-trivial asymptotic analysis to derive a PDE for $u_0(x)$, then solving it. This level of detail might constitute a derivation.
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   Rephrase the question to specifically ask for the differential equation that $u_0(x)$ satisfies, rather than "an expression for $u_0(x)$". This makes the expected output a symbolic equation, which is less likely to be perceived as a full derivation of a function's closed form and aligns better with the "single output" and "solvable target" guidelines. For example: "Find the differential equation satisfied by $u_0(x)$."

**Question 2:**
"<question>Let $\mathcal{G}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ be a Colombeau algebra of generalized functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Consider a non-linear partial differential equation with singularities, given by $F(x, u(x), \partial u(x), \partial^2 u(x)) = 0$, where $u(x) \in \mathcal{G}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Suppose that the equation admits a distributional solution $u_0(x)$ which belongs to $H^s(\mathbb{R}^n)$, a Sobolev space with regularity $s < 0$. Given an embedding theorem that relates the Colombeau algebra $\mathcal{G}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to a scale of Sobolev spaces, find a condition on the regularity index $s$ that ensures the existence of an embedding $H^s(\mathbb{R}^n) \hookrightarrow \mathcal{G}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Express this condition in terms of the mollifier used in the construction of the Colombeau algebra, and determine the minimum value of $s$ for which such an embedding is guaranteed to exist.</question>"

*   **Violations:**
    *   **Guideline 4 (Single Output):** The question asks for two distinct outputs: "a condition on the regularity index $s$" and "the minimum value of $s$".
    *   **Guideline 10 (No multiple parts):** Directly violated as it explicitly asks for two separate pieces of information.
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   Split this into two separate questions, each requesting only one specific output. Alternatively, refine the question to ask for a single, composite symbolic answer that encapsulates both requirements, or select only one of the two desired outputs. For example: "Determine the minimum value of $s$ (in terms of the mollifier properties) for which an embedding $H^s(\mathbb{R}^n) \hookrightarrow \mathcal{G}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is guaranteed to exist."

**Question 3:**
"<question>Consider a differential equation of the form $x^2 y''(x) + x p(x) y'(x) + q(x) y(x) = 0$, where $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are analytic functions at $x=0$. Let $p(0) = p_0$ and $q(0) = q_0$. If the indicial equation $r(r-1) + p_0 r + q_0 = 0$ has roots $r_1$ and $r_2$ such that $r_1 - r_2 = N$, where $N$ is a non-negative integer, and assuming that the method of Frobenius yields two linearly independent solutions of the form $y_1(x) = x^{r_1} \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n$ and $y_2(x) = x^{r_2} \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n x^n + C y_1(x) \ln(x)$, derive an expression for the constant $C$ in terms of the coefficients $a_n$ and $b_n$ and the functions $p(x)$ and $q(x)$.</question>"

*   **Violations:**
    *   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target - not proofs/derivations):** The question explicitly uses the word "derive," which violates the instruction "Questions must not be proves or derivations."
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** This is a very standard textbook problem in ordinary differential equations, specifically the case of Frobenius method where roots differ by an integer and a logarithmic term appears. The derivation of the constant $C$ is a canonical procedure taught in most ODE courses, making it not "unique and non-trivial" as per the guideline.
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   Change "derive an expression" to "find an expression" or "state the expression" to align with the "no derivations" rule.
    *   To improve originality, consider altering the problem such that it requires a non-standard application or extension of the Frobenius method, rather than the direct textbook formula for $C$. For example, use a specific, complex $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ and ask for a particular coefficient or property of the solution beyond a direct formula.

**Question 4:**
"<question>Let $\{u_n\}$ be a hypersequence of smooth functions converging to a distribution $u$ in the sense of Colombeau algebras. Assume that each $u_n$ satisfies a partial differential equation with singular coefficients, specifically, consider the equation $a(x) \partial_x u_n(x) + b(x) u_n(x) = f_n(x)$, where $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ are distributions belonging to a Colombeau algebra and admitting singular behavior near $x=0$. Suppose that the equation is solved using a fixed point theorem adapted for hypersequences. If the fixed point operator $T$ associated with the differential equation satisfies the contraction mapping property with respect to a suitable metric $d$ defined on the space of hypersequences, and if $\{f_n\}$ is a Cauchy hypersequence converging to $f$ in the Colombeau algebra, determine an expression for the limit $u$ of the hypersequence $\{u_n\}$ in terms of the fixed point $u^*$ of the operator $T$, assuming that $u^*$ is a solution in the Colombeau sense.</question>"

*   **Violations:**
    *   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target - not proofs/derivations):** Similar to Question 1, asking to "determine an expression for the limit $u$" in terms of the fixed point $u^*$ could be considered a "derivation" or an application of a fundamental theorem rather than a direct symbolic calculation. Given the context of a fixed point theorem, it is highly likely that $u=u^*$ is the expected answer, which would make the question too trivial if it's simply a statement of definition or a well-known result. If it requires proving $u=u^*$, it's a derivation.
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   Rephrase the question to ask for a specific, non-trivial symbolic property or characteristic of $u$ or $u^*$ that requires analytical steps beyond merely stating $u=u^*$. For example, "What is the relationship between the singular support of $u$ and the singular behavior of the coefficients $a(x)$ and $b(x)$, given that $u^*$ is a solution in the Colombeau sense?" This would encourage a deeper understanding of the implications of the fixed point solution in Colombeau algebra, rather than just its formal expression.

1.  <question>Consider a particle of mass $m$ moving in a two-dimensional potential $V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \lambda x^2 y^2$, where $k > 0$ and $\lambda > 0$. Use perturbation theory to calculate the first-order correction to the energy levels of the particle due to the $\lambda x^2 y^2$ term. Give the result for the energy of the state with quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y)$ in terms of $m$, $k$, $\lambda$, $n_x$, and $n_y$.</question>

2.  <question>A superconducting qubit is capacitively coupled to a microwave resonator. The qubit has energy level splitting $\omega_q$ and the resonator has frequency $\omega_r$.  The coupling strength between the qubit and resonator is $g$.  In the dispersive regime, where $|\omega_q - \omega_r| \gg g$, calculate the effective shift in the resonator frequency as a function of the qubit's state (ground or excited). Express your answer in terms of $\omega_q$, $\omega_r$, and $g$.</question>

Here's a critique of each question:

**Question 1:**
*   **Critique:** Violates Guideline 6 (Originality) as this is a very common textbook problem for perturbation theory applied to a 2D harmonic oscillator. Slightly violates Guideline 4 & 10 (Single Output/Single Part) by asking for both the "first-order correction" and the "energy of the state," which could be interpreted as two separate quantities to calculate.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Rephrase to ask for a single quantity (e.g., "Calculate the energy of the state, including the first-order perturbation correction...") and modify the potential or context to be less conventional.

**Question 2:**
*   **Critique:** Violates Guideline 6 (Originality) as calculating the dispersive shift in a qubit-resonator system is a standard problem, often a direct application of a known formula or a canonical perturbation theory example in quantum optics.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Introduce a less common coupling mechanism, an additional perturbation, or a different regime of operation to make the problem unique and non-trivial.

**Question 3:**
*   **Critique:** Violates Guideline 6 (Originality) as determining the chemical potential for a BEC in a harmonic trap under the Thomas-Fermi approximation is a fundamental and frequently solved problem in quantum gases.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Consider a different trap geometry, an additional interaction term, or a more complex scenario involving BEC dynamics to increase originality.

**Question 4:**
*   **Critique:** Violates Guideline 6 (Originality) as the calculation of total power radiated by a relativistic electron in a uniform magnetic field (synchrotron radiation) is a classic problem in relativistic electrodynamics found in many textbooks.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Introduce a time-varying magnetic field, an additional electric field, or ask for a different aspect of the radiation (e.g., angular distribution, spectral properties for a non-ideal scenario) to enhance originality.

Here's the improved set of physics questions, addressing the feedback provided. I've focused on increasing originality and ensuring a single, clear output for each question.

1.  <question>Consider a particle of mass $m$ moving in a two-dimensional potential $V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \lambda |x| y^2$, where $k > 0$ and $\lambda > 0$. Use perturbation theory to calculate the energy of the state with quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y)$, including the first-order perturbation correction due to the $\lambda |x| y^2$ term. Assume the unperturbed wavefunctions are those of the 2D harmonic oscillator. Give the result in terms of $m$, $k$, $\lambda$, $n_x$, and $n_y$. Note that due to the absolute value, this requires careful consideration of the integral over x. </question>

2.  <question>A superconducting qubit is coupled to a microwave resonator via a *non-linear* Josephson junction. The qubit has energy level splitting $\omega_q$ and the resonator has frequency $\omega_r$. The coupling introduces a term of the form $g(a + a^\dagger)(\sigma_+ + \sigma_-) + h (a + a^\dagger)^2 (\sigma_+ + \sigma_-)$, where *a* and *a*<sup>†</sup> are the resonator annihilation and creation operators, σ<sub>+</sub> and σ<sub>-</sub> are the qubit raising and lowering operators, and *g* and *h* are coupling strengths.  Assuming $|\omega_q - \omega_r| \gg g, h$, calculate the *change* in the resonator frequency as a function of the qubit's state (ground or excited) due to the *non-linear* coupling term, *h*(a + a<sup>†</sup>)<sup>2</sup> (σ<sub>+</sub> + σ<sub>-</sub>). Express your answer in terms of $\omega_q$, $\omega_r$, *g* and *h* and consider only terms up to second order in perturbation theory. </question>

3.  <question>A Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of $N$ atoms with mass $m$ and a *p-wave* scattering length $a_p$ is confined in an anisotropic harmonic trap with frequencies $\omega_x$, $\omega_y$, and $\omega_z$.  Unlike s-wave scattering, p-wave interactions are anisotropic. Assuming the system is in the Thomas-Fermi regime and that the interatomic interaction can be described by a contact potential characterized by $a_p$, determine the *average* chemical potential, $\bar{\mu} = (\mu_x + \mu_y + \mu_z)/3$, of the BEC. Give your answer in terms of $N$, $m$, $\omega_x$, $\omega_y$, $\omega_z$ and $a_p$. Assume weak anisotropy:  $\omega_x \approx \omega_y \approx \omega_z$.</question>

4.  <question>Consider a relativistic electron with energy $E$ moving in a magnetic field that is *spatially uniform* but *oscillates in time* as $\vec{B}(t) = B_0 \cos(\Omega t) \hat{z}$. The electron's initial momentum is in the $x$-$y$ plane. Calculate the *time-averaged* total power radiated by the electron. Express your answer in terms of $E$, $B_0$, $\Omega$, the electron charge $e$, and the electron mass $m$. Assume that $\Omega$ is much smaller than the cyclotron frequency of the electron in the magnetic field. </question>
