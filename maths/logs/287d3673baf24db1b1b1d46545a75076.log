Here are some novel university-level physics questions based on the provided topics, key concepts, and guidelines:

1.  <question>
A stochastic process $X(t)$ is observed at discrete times $t_i$, where the observation times are drawn from a non-homogeneous Poisson process with intensity function $\lambda(t) = A + B\cos(\omega t)$, where $A > |B|$. The observed process $X(t)$ is Gaussian with mean zero and covariance function $C(t,s) = e^{-\gamma |t-s|}$. Assuming a Bayesian framework with a Gaussian process prior on the unknown parameters, what is the asymptotic expression for the variance of the posterior distribution of $\gamma$ as $A \to \infty$, assuming $B$ and $\omega$ are fixed?
</question>

2.  <question>
Consider estimating an unknown function $f(x)$ on $[0,1]$ from noisy observations $Y_i = f(x_i) + \epsilon_i$, where the $x_i$ are sampled uniformly at random from $[0,1]$ and $\epsilon_i$ are i.i.d. Gaussian noise with variance $\sigma^2$. The observation times $t_i$ are governed by $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \delta(t - t_i)$. Let $f(x)$ belong to a Besov space $B_{p,q}^{\alpha}$ with norm $\|f\|_{B_{p,q}^{\alpha}} \le M$. Assuming an adaptive estimator $\hat{f}$ is constructed using wavelet thresholding with hard thresholding, find the minimax rate for estimating $f$ under the $L^2$ risk, given the observation regime is high-frequency such that the sampling density is greater than the Nyquist rate. Express this rate as a function of $n$, $\alpha$, $p$, $q$, and $M$.
</question>

3.  <question>
Let $K(x, y)$ be a Calderón-Zygmund kernel on $\mathbb{R}^d$, and let $T$ be the associated Calderón-Zygmund operator. Suppose we observe $n$ independent realizations of a random variable $Z_i = Tf(x_i) + \eta_i$, where the $x_i$ are uniformly distributed in a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, $f \in L^2(\Omega)$, and $\eta_i$ are i.i.d. sub-Gaussian random variables with variance $\sigma^2$. Derive an upper bound for the empirical characteristic function of the residuals $Z_i - \hat{T}f(x_i)$, where $\hat{T}$ is an estimator for $T$ in terms of $n$, $\sigma$, and the operator norm of $T$.
</question>

4.  <question>
A particle moves in a potential $V(x)$, where the potential is only observed at discrete, irregularly spaced times. The force acting on the particle is given by $F(x) = -\nabla V(x)$. The observation times are generated by a renewal process with inter-arrival times distributed according to an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\lambda$. If the particle's position $x(t)$ is governed by the Langevin equation $\ddot{x} + \gamma \dot{x} = F(x) + \xi(t)$, where $\xi(t)$ is white noise with intensity $D$, determine the effective diffusion coefficient $D_{\text{eff}}$ for the particle's motion in the limit of very low observation frequency (small $\lambda$), expressed in terms of $D$, $\gamma$, and the moments of $F(x)$. Assume that $\langle F(x) \rangle = 0$.
</question>

5.  <question>
Consider a linear inverse problem $y = Ax + \epsilon$, where $y \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is the observed data, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is a known matrix, $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the unknown signal, and $\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is additive Gaussian noise with covariance matrix $\sigma^2 I$. The entries of the matrix A are observed under a random sampling scheme. Assume that only a subset of the rows of A are available. The sampling is row-wise with probability $p_i$ for the $i$-th row, $i = 1, \dots, m$. Let $\hat{x}$ be the ordinary least squares estimator of x based on the observed data. Derive the expression for the mean squared error $E[\|\hat{x} - x\|^2]$ as a function of $A$, $\sigma$, $p_i$ and $x$.
</question>
=== Turn 0: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of the provided questions based on your guidelines:

**General Feedback:**

*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target - No Derivations):** A significant issue across questions 1, 3, 4, and 5 is the use of verbs like "Derive" or "Determine" when the guideline explicitly states "Questions must not be proves or derivations." While these questions ask for a symbolic result, the phrasing implies a derivation process is expected as part of the answer, which contradicts the instruction. It should be changed to "What is the expression for...", "State the expression for...", or similar.
*   **Feasibility and Underspecification:** Several questions (particularly 1, 3, 4) appear to be exceptionally complex, potentially at a research level, or underspecified in key details, making it difficult to arrive at a single, unambiguous symbolic answer without further assumptions or very advanced knowledge.

---

**Question 1:**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** The phrase "what is the asymptotic expression for..." is acceptable as it asks for a formula, but the inherent complexity of the problem makes it borderline for typical university-level assessment if a simple closed-form symbolic answer is truly expected. This problem is extremely advanced, potentially beyond standard graduate coursework.
    *   **Clarity/Completeness:** "Gaussian process prior on the unknown parameters" is ambiguous. Which parameters are unknown and have a prior? Is it just $\gamma$, or also $A, B, \omega$? This needs to be explicitly stated for a well-defined problem.
    *   **Feasibility:** Determining the asymptotic posterior variance of a single parameter in a Gaussian process observed through a non-homogeneous Poisson process is analytically very challenging, likely requiring specialized asymptotic statistical theory (e.g., frequentist asymptotic results for Bayesian posteriors) that might not yield a simple, universally agreed-upon "symbolic result" in a compact form.

*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   Specify *which* unknown parameters have a Gaussian process prior (e.g., "a Gaussian process prior on $\gamma$").
    *   Re-evaluate the expected level of analytical solvability. Ensure it's genuinely solvable to a clear, expressible symbolic result for the target audience.

---

**Question 2:**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Minimax rates for Besov spaces under $L^2$ risk and Gaussian noise are standard results in non-parametric statistics. While the problem setup is valid, the "high-frequency... Nyquist rate" condition feels either redundant or slightly misapplied. The Nyquist rate is typically for bandlimited signals, which a general Besov space function is not necessarily. If it just means "sampling is dense enough not to be the limiting factor," simpler phrasing would be better.
    *   **Relevance/Clarity of Nyquist Rate:** For functions in Besov spaces, the dominant factor for minimax rates is usually the smoothness ($\alpha$), dimension, and noise level, assuming sufficiently dense sampling. The Nyquist rate condition might be a distractor or conceptually imprecise in this context.

*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   Refine or remove the phrase "given the observation regime is high-frequency such that the sampling density is greater than the Nyquist rate." If the intent is just to ensure sampling is not the bottleneck, simpler phrasing like "assuming sufficiently dense sampling" would be clearer.

---

**Question 3:**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target - No Derivations):** The verb "Derive" directly violates the guideline "Questions must not be proves or derivations."
    *   **Clarity/Completeness:** The problem is underspecified. "$\hat{T}$ is an estimator for $T$" – what form does $\hat{T}$ take? Is it a specific type of estimator (e.g., least squares, regularized inversion, wavelet-based)? The characteristics of the residuals (and their empirical characteristic function) heavily depend on how $\hat{T}$ is constructed. Also, is $f(x)$ known or unknown? The complexity changes significantly based on this.
    *   **Feasibility:** Estimating Calderón-Zygmund operators from noisy data and deriving properties of their residuals is a very complex research topic. Without a specified estimator, the problem is not solvable to a single, unambiguous result.

*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   Change "Derive" to "State" or "Determine the expression for..." to comply with Guideline 3.
    *   Specify the form/construction of the estimator $\hat{T}$.
    *   Clarify whether $f(x)$ is known or unknown.

---

**Question 4:**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target - No Derivations):** The verb "determine" is acceptable, but the overall complexity could push it towards a derivation.
    *   **Conceptual Clarity/Consistency:** The phrasing "determine the effective diffusion coefficient $D_{\text{eff}}$ for the particle's motion" in the context of "potential is only observed at discrete... times" is problematic. Observation times typically affect *estimation* or *inference* of parameters, not the *physical dynamics* of the particle unless there's an explicit feedback mechanism from observation to dynamics. If the physical Langevin equation governs the motion, its $D_{\text{eff}}$ would be determined by the system parameters, not the observation frequency $\lambda$. This suggests a potential conceptual misunderstanding or a highly subtle interpretation that needs clarification. If it refers to an *inferred* diffusion coefficient, the inference method must be specified.
    *   **Feasibility:** This is an extremely challenging problem, combining advanced statistical mechanics (Langevin equation, effective diffusion) with renewal processes and non-linear forces. Obtaining a closed-form expression for $D_{\text{eff}}$ in such a scenario, especially in the limit of "very low observation frequency" for physical dynamics, seems highly unlikely to be solvable in a standard assessment format.

*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   Clarify the precise meaning of "effective diffusion coefficient $D_{\text{eff}}$" in this context. Does it refer to the particle's physical motion, or an estimable quantity from the observations? If the latter, specify the estimation method. If the former, explain how observation times physically influence the particle's dynamics.
    *   Simplify the problem significantly if a solvable symbolic expression is truly desired.

---

**Question 5:**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target - No Derivations):** The verb "Derive" directly violates the guideline "Questions must not be proves or derivations."
    *   **Clarity/Completeness:** "Let $\hat{x}$ be the ordinary least squares estimator of x based on the observed data." This needs clarification. If only a subset of rows of $A$ (let's call the observed sub-matrix $A_S$) are available, $A_S^T A_S$ might be singular if the number of sampled rows is less than $n$ or if the sampled rows do not span the space. The OLS estimator $\hat{x} = (A_S^T A_S)^{-1} A_S^T y_S$ is only well-defined if $(A_S^T A_S)$ is invertible. The problem needs to specify how to handle singularity (e.g., use a pseudo-inverse, or assume conditions where it's almost surely invertible).

*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   Change "Derive" to "State" or "Determine the expression for..." to comply with Guideline 3.
    *   Clarify how the OLS estimator $\hat{x}$ is defined if the matrix formed by the sampled rows is not full column rank (e.g., specify use of a pseudo-inverse, or state conditions under which $A_S^T A_S$ is invertible).

Here's a revised set of questions addressing the feedback, aiming for university-level difficulty while avoiding explicit derivation requests and clarifying ambiguities:

1.  <question>
A stochastic process $X(t)$ is observed at discrete times $t_i$, where the observation times are drawn from a non-homogeneous Poisson process with intensity function $\lambda(t) = A + B\cos(\omega t)$, where $A > |B|$. The observed process $X(t)$ is Gaussian with mean zero and covariance function $C(t,s) = e^{-\gamma |t-s|}$. Assuming a Bayesian framework with a Gaussian prior on the parameter $\gamma$, what is the asymptotic expression for the variance of the posterior distribution of $\gamma$ as $A \to \infty$, assuming $B$ and $\omega$ are fixed and known?
</question>

2.  <question>
Consider estimating an unknown function $f(x)$ on $[0,1]$ from noisy observations $Y_i = f(x_i) + \epsilon_i$, where the $x_i$ are sampled uniformly at random from $[0,1]$ and $\epsilon_i$ are i.i.d. Gaussian noise with variance $\sigma^2$. Let $f(x)$ belong to a Besov space $B_{p,q}^{\alpha}$ with norm $\|f\|_{B_{p,q}^{\alpha}} \le M$. Assuming an adaptive estimator $\hat{f}$ is constructed using wavelet thresholding with hard thresholding and sufficiently dense sampling, find the minimax rate for estimating $f$ under the $L^2$ risk. Express this rate as a function of $n$, $\alpha$, $p$, $q$, and $M$.
</question>

3.  <question>
Let $K(x, y)$ be a Calderón-Zygmund kernel on $\mathbb{R}^d$, and let $T$ be the associated Calderón-Zygmund operator. Suppose we observe $n$ independent realizations of a random variable $Z_i = Tf(x_i) + \eta_i$, where the $x_i$ are uniformly distributed in a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, $f \in L^2(\Omega)$ is a known function, and $\eta_i$ are i.i.d. sub-Gaussian random variables with variance $\sigma^2$. Let $\hat{T}$ be a sample average estimator of the operator $T$ defined as $\hat{T}f(x) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Z_i - \eta_i$. What is an upper bound for the empirical characteristic function of the residuals $Z_i - \hat{T}f(x_i)$ in terms of $n$, $\sigma$, and the operator norm of $T$?
</question>

4.  <question>
A particle moves in a potential $V(x)$. The force acting on the particle is given by $F(x) = -\nabla V(x)$. The particle's position $x(t)$ is governed by the Langevin equation $\ddot{x} + \gamma \dot{x} = F(x) + \xi(t)$, where $\xi(t)$ is white noise with intensity $D$. Assume that $\langle F(x) \rangle = 0$. Due to limitations in measurement, we can only estimate the force, $F(x)$, from irregularly spaced observations of the particle's position.  If we consider a long timescale compared to the inter-observation times, what effective diffusion coefficient, $D_{\text{eff}}$, characterizes the particle's long-time motion, expressed in terms of $D$, $\gamma$, and the moments of $F(x)$? Assume the underlying system parameters do not change due to observation limitations.
</question>

5.  <question>
Consider a linear inverse problem $y = Ax + \epsilon$, where $y \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is the observed data, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is a known matrix, $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the unknown signal, and $\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is additive Gaussian noise with covariance matrix $\sigma^2 I$. The entries of the matrix A are observed under a random sampling scheme. Assume that only a subset of the rows of A are available. The sampling is row-wise with probability $p_i$ for the $i$-th row, $i = 1, \dots, m$. Let $A_S$ be the observed submatrix, which is assumed to be full column rank.  Let $\hat{x} = (A_S^T A_S)^{-1} A_S^T y$ be the ordinary least squares estimator of x based on the observed data. What is the expression for the mean squared error $E[\|\hat{x} - x\|^2]$ as a function of $A$, $\sigma$, $p_i$ and $x$?
</question>
=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of the provided questions:

**Question 1:**
*   **Critique:** The phrase "asymptotic expression" often implies a derivation of the functional form itself, which could conflict with the "Questions must not be proves or derivations" guideline (Guideline 3). While the final answer is an expression, obtaining it for such a complex setup typically requires significant theoretical derivation steps, such as computing the Fisher Information for a Gaussian process observed via a non-homogeneous Poisson process, and then using large sample theory results like the Bernstein-von Mises theorem. If the intent is for the student to *apply* a known formula for the asymptotic variance of a Bayesian posterior, then the question is extremely challenging but potentially valid. However, the calculation of the Fisher information itself in this context is a non-trivial derivation.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Clarify whether the question expects the recall and application of a known asymptotic formula after complex computation, or if it expects the derivation of such a formula. If the latter, it violates Guideline 3. Rephrase to clearly specify that a direct formula/expression is sought, perhaps by providing hints to relevant theorems, or simplifying the setup.

**Question 2:**
*   **Critique:** This question asks for a well-known, standard result in non-parametric statistics – the minimax rate for estimating functions in Besov spaces using wavelet thresholding. This directly violates the "Originality" guideline (Guideline 6: "Avoid rewording standard textbook problems"). While challenging, it primarily tests recall of a fundamental theorem rather than multi-step reasoning to *derive* a new result or adapt an existing one significantly.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To adhere to Guideline 6, modify the problem to introduce a novel aspect or perturbation that prevents direct recall of a standard result. For example, consider a different sampling scheme, a more complex noise structure, or a different functional space/norm combination for which the standard rates are not immediately applicable or require a nuanced derivation.

**Question 3:**
*   **Critique:** This question has several significant issues:
    1.  **Ambiguous Target (Guideline 3, 9):** "What is an upper bound for the empirical characteristic function of the residuals...?" The "upper bound" for a complex-valued function (a characteristic function) is ill-defined. Does it mean an upper bound on its magnitude $|E[\phi_t(R)]|$ or $E[|\phi_t(R)|]$? Or a high-probability bound? This needs clarification.
    2.  **Ill-Defined Estimator (Guideline 2, 9):** The estimator $\hat{T}f(x) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Z_i - \eta_i$ is mathematically ill-posed. The term $-\eta_i$ outside the sum is ambiguous (which $\eta_i$? the last one? an average?), and the general form suggests a scalar estimate, whereas $T$ is an operator mapping functions to functions, and $Tf(x)$ is a function. The variable $x$ in $\hat{T}f(x)$ is not related to the observation points $x_i$ in a clear way.
    3.  **Ambiguous Observations (Guideline 2, 9):** How $Z_i = Tf(x_i) + \eta_i$ relates to $Tf(x)$ (a function) needs clarification. Are $Z_i$ scalar observations of $Tf$ evaluated at $x_i$?
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Rigorously redefine the nature of the observations $Z_i$ and the estimator $\hat{T}f(x)$ to be mathematically coherent. Clearly specify what "upper bound" is sought for the empirical characteristic function (e.g., its expectation, its magnitude's expectation, or a probabilistic bound). Ensure consistent notation and a well-defined mathematical structure.

**Question 4:**
*   **Critique:**
    1.  **Irrelevant Information (Guideline 5):** The details about "irregularly spaced observations" and "observation limitations" are irrelevant to the core question of finding the effective diffusion coefficient of the particle's long-time motion itself, especially given the explicit statement "Assume the underlying system parameters do not change due to observation limitations." This information serves as a distractor.
    2.  **Ambiguous Assumption (Guideline 9):** The assumption "Assume that $\langle F(x) \rangle = 0$" is ambiguous. Does it mean the spatial average of $F(x)$ is zero, or the ensemble average of $F(X(t))$ under the system's stationary/equilibrium distribution is zero, or a time average along a trajectory? Given that $F(x) = -\nabla V(x)$, its average being zero under specific measures implies properties of the potential.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Remove the distracting information about observation limitations. Clearly define the meaning of $\langle F(x) \rangle = 0$, for instance, by specifying "Assume that the force $F(x)$ is conservative such that its average over the equilibrium distribution of the particle's position is zero."

**Question 5:**
*   **Critique:** This question adheres well to all specified guidelines. It provides a clear, well-defined setup, asks for a single, unambiguous symbolic expression, requires multi-step reasoning (handling random sampling of rows for the MSE calculation), and is sufficiently original given the specific random sampling scheme.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** No specific improvements are needed; the question is well-posed and aligns with the guidelines.

Okay, here's a revised set of questions, addressing the feedback provided. The aim is to create challenging, original problems suitable for university-level physics, while adhering to the stated guidelines:

1.  <question>A quantum particle of mass $m$ is confined to a one-dimensional potential well of the form $V(x) = \lambda |x|$, where $\lambda > 0$.  Instead of directly solving the Schrödinger equation, we wish to approximate the ground state energy using a variational method. Consider a trial wavefunction of the form $\psi(x) = A e^{-\alpha x^2}$, where $A$ is a normalization constant and $\alpha$ is a variational parameter. What is the optimized value of $\alpha$ that minimizes the energy expectation value $\langle E \rangle = \langle \psi | H | \psi \rangle$, and what is the corresponding approximate ground state energy?</question>

2.  <question>A thin, flexible rod of length $L$ is clamped at one end and free at the other.  The rod has a uniform mass per unit length $\mu$ and is subject to a constant, downward gravitational acceleration $g$. Due to thermal fluctuations, the free end of the rod exhibits small, random displacements in the horizontal direction. Assuming the rod remains in the elastic regime, and treating the horizontal displacement as a small perturbation, develop an approximate expression for the horizontal displacement of the free end due to thermal fluctuations. Express the displacement in terms of $L$, $\mu$, $g$, the bending stiffness $EI$ of the rod, and the temperature $T$ where $E$ is Young's modulus and $I$ is the second moment of area of the cross-section.</question>

3.  <question>Consider a system of $N$ identical, non-interacting bosons confined to a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. At zero temperature, all bosons condense into the ground state. Now, suppose the system is perturbed by a weak, repulsive contact interaction of the form $U(r_i - r_j) = g \delta(r_i - r_j)$ between each pair of bosons, where $g > 0$ is a small coupling constant. Using the Bogoliubov approximation, determine the low-lying excitation spectrum (the dispersion relation) of the interacting Bose-Einstein condensate.</question>

4.  <question>A black hole of mass $M$ is surrounded by a thin, accretion disk composed of ionized gas. The gas orbits the black hole in a nearly Keplerian manner.  However, the gas also radiates energy due to viscous friction within the disk. Assuming the disk is geometrically thin and optically thick, such that it radiates locally as a blackbody, derive an expression for the radial temperature profile $T(r)$ of the accretion disk. Express the temperature in terms of the black hole mass $M$, the accretion rate $\dot{M}$, the radial distance $r$ from the black hole, the speed of light $c$, and the gravitational constant $G$.</question>

5.  <question>A superconducting ring of radius $R$ is placed in a uniform magnetic field $B$ oriented perpendicular to the plane of the ring. Due to quantum mechanical effects, the magnetic flux through the ring is quantized in units of the flux quantum $\Phi_0 = h/(2e)$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $e$ is the elementary charge. The ring contains a weak link, a small section where the superconductivity is suppressed, effectively introducing a Josephson junction. Assuming the Josephson energy is much smaller than the kinetic energy of the Cooper pairs, determine the critical current $I_c$ that the ring can sustain as a function of the applied magnetic field $B$, expressed in terms of $R$, $h$, $e$, the Josephson coupling energy $E_J$, and the inductance $L$ of the ring.</question>
