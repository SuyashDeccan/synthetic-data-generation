Here are some novel university-level Mathematics questions based on the provided topics, concepts, and guidelines:

1.  <question>Consider a smooth, proper variety $X$ over a field $k$ of characteristic zero. Let $CH^*(X)$ denote the Chow ring of $X$ and $H^*_{mot}(X, \mathbb{Q})$ denote its motivic cohomology with rational coefficients. Assume there is a cycle class map $cl: CH^*(X) \to H^*_{mot}(X, \mathbb{Q})$. If $X$ satisfies Poincaré duality, express the pairing  $$ \langle \alpha, \beta \rangle = \int_X cl(\alpha) \cup cl(\beta) $$ in terms of intersection numbers of algebraic cycles on $X$, where $\alpha, \beta \in CH^*(X)$.</question>

2.  <question>Let $X$ be a smooth scheme over a field $k$, and let $[X/G]$ denote the quotient stack of $X$ by a finite group $G$. Consider the étale cohomology $H^*_{et}([X/G], \mathbb{Q}_{\ell})$ with $\ell$ prime to the order of $G$. Formulate a formula for the étale cohomology of the quotient stack $[X/G]$ in terms of the $G$-equivariant étale cohomology of $X$, $H^*_{et,G}(X, \mathbb{Q}_{\ell})$.</question>

3.  <question>Let $Sm/S$ denote the category of smooth schemes over a base scheme $S$. Given a presheaf of spectra $E$ on $Sm/S$ in the Nisnevich topology, suppose $E$ satisfies the motivic homotopy axiom (i.e., $E(X) \to E(\mathbb{A}^1_X)$ is a weak equivalence for all $X \in Sm/S$). If $f: X \to Y$ is a Nisnevich covering in $Sm/S$, and $E(X) \to E(Y)$ is a map of spectra, derive a spectral sequence computing the homotopy groups of the homotopy fiber of this map in terms of the Čech complex associated to the covering.</question>

4.  <question>Let $X$ be a smooth algebraic variety over a perfect field $k$. Suppose $C_*(X, \mathbb{Z})$ denotes the complex of Suslin cycles and $\mathbb{Z}(n)$ is the motivic complex. Formulate an expression relating the hypercohomology of $X$ with coefficients in the shifted motivic complex $\mathbb{Z}(n)[2n]$ and the algebraic K-theory $K_*(X)$ of $X$.</question>

5.  <question>Consider a triangulated category $\mathcal{T}$ and a $t$-structure $(\mathcal{T}_{\leq 0}, \mathcal{T}_{\geq 0})$ on $\mathcal{T}$. Let $\mathcal{C} = \mathcal{T}_{\leq 0} \cap \mathcal{T}_{\geq 0}$ be the heart of the $t$-structure. Express the condition that the $t$-structure is non-degenerate (i.e., $\bigcap_n \mathcal{T}_{\leq n} = \bigcap_n \mathcal{T}_{\geq -n} = \{0\}$) in terms of vanishing conditions on the Ext functors between objects in $\mathcal{C}$.</question>
=== Turn 0: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of the provided questions based on your guidelines:

**General Feedback:**
The questions are consistently high-level, addressing advanced topics in algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, and category theory. They generally adhere to input/output format, conciseness, language, and single-part requirements. However, a significant recurring issue is the violation of **Guideline 3 (Not proofs or derivations)**, **Guideline 6 (Originality)**, and **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning)**. All questions, in their current form, essentially ask for the direct recall or statement of a fundamental definition, isomorphism, or major theorem. This implies a lack of multi-step reasoning beyond direct knowledge retrieval.

---

**Question 1 Critique:**
"Consider a smooth, proper variety $X$ over a field $k$ of characteristic zero. Let $CH^*(X)$ denote the Chow ring of $X$ and $H^*_{mot}(X, \mathbb{Q})$ denote its motivic cohomology with rational coefficients. Assume there is a cycle class map $cl: CH^*(X) \to H^*_{mot}(X, \mathbb{Q})$. If $X$ satisfies Poincaré duality, express the pairing $$ \langle \alpha, \beta \rangle = \int_X cl(\alpha) \cup cl(\beta) $$ in terms of intersection numbers of algebraic cycles on $X$, where $\alpha, \beta \in CH^*(X)$."

*   **Critique:** This question asks for a fundamental property relating the cup product in motivic cohomology to the intersection product on algebraic cycles via the cycle class map and Poincaré duality. This is a direct statement of a defining characteristic or a foundational theorem (e.g., compatibility of cycle class maps with products and the existence of a pushforward/integration map). As such, it violates **Guideline 6 (Originality)** and **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning)** because it primarily tests recall of a known result rather than requiring a derivation or application in a novel scenario. It is also very close to being a "derivation" in spirit, even if the phrasing "express" is used.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Rephrase to require the application of this property in a specific, non-trivial context. For example, provide a specific variety and cycles, and ask for a computation that relies on this identity, or ask for a relation in a more complex setup where direct application is not immediately obvious.

---

**Question 2 Critique:**
"Let $X$ be a smooth scheme over a field $k$, and let $[X/G]$ denote the quotient stack of $X$ by a finite group $G$. Consider the étale cohomology $H^*_{et}([X/G], \mathbb{Q}_{\ell})$ with $\ell$ prime to the order of $G$. Formulate a formula for the étale cohomology of the quotient stack $[X/G]$ in terms of the $G$-equivariant étale cohomology of $X$, $H^*_{et,G}(X, \mathbb{Q}_{\ell})$."

*   **Critique:** This question asks for a direct statement of an isomorphism that is essentially a definition or a fundamental theorem in the theory of stacks and equivariant cohomology (specifically, $H^*_{et}([X/G], \mathbb{Q}_{\ell}) \cong H^*_{et,G}(X, \mathbb{Q}_{\ell})$ for finite groups $G$). This is a direct recall of a basic equivalence. It violates **Guideline 6 (Originality)** and **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning)** as it lacks any non-trivial steps beyond recalling this direct isomorphism. It is akin to asking for the definition of a well-known mathematical object.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Instead of asking for the definition/isomorphism, set up a problem where understanding this equivalence is a *step* towards solving a larger computation. For instance, ask to compute a specific cohomology group of a concrete quotient stack based on known equivariant cohomology of the underlying space, or to relate it to a different cohomology theory if $G$ is non-trivial.

---

**Question 3 Critique:**
"Let $Sm/S$ denote the category of smooth schemes over a base scheme $S$. Given a presheaf of spectra $E$ on $Sm/S$ in the Nisnevich topology, suppose $E$ satisfies the motivic homotopy axiom (i.e., $E(X) \to E(\mathbb{A}^1_X)$ is a weak equivalence for all $X \in Sm/S$). If $f: X \to Y$ is a Nisnevich covering in $Sm/S$, and $E(X) \to E(Y)$ is a map of spectra, derive a spectral sequence computing the homotopy groups of the homotopy fiber of this map in terms of the Čech complex associated to the covering."

*   **Critique:** The phrase "derive a spectral sequence" directly violates **Guideline 3 (Questions must not be proves or derivations)**. Even if the intent is to "state" the spectral sequence, it is a very standard result in generalized cohomology theories on sites with a good notion of Čech cohomology (e.g., the Čech spectral sequence for a presheaf of spectra). This makes it problematic for **Guideline 6 (Originality)** and **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning)**.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Change "derive" to "state" or "formulate" to address Guideline 3. To improve G6 and G7, perhaps specify a particular choice of $E$ (e.g., K-theory spectrum, motivic cohomology spectrum) and a specific covering, then ask for a specific term of the spectral sequence in terms of more basic invariants, requiring a particular application of the general result.

---

**Question 4 Critique:**
"Let $X$ be a smooth algebraic variety over a perfect field $k$. Suppose $C_*(X, \mathbb{Z})$ denotes the complex of Suslin cycles and $\mathbb{Z}(n)$ is the motivic complex. Formulate an expression relating the hypercohomology of $X$ with coefficients in the shifted motivic complex $\mathbb{Z}(n)[2n]$ and the algebraic K-theory $K_*(X)$ of $X$."

*   **Critique:** This question directly asks for the statement of a version of the Bloch-Lichtenbaum-Voevodsky (BLV) theorem (a deep and fundamental result in motivic cohomology and K-theory). Specifically, it relates motivic cohomology to K-theory via isomorphisms $H^j_{mot}(X, \mathbb{Z}(n)) \otimes \mathbb{Q} \cong K_{2n-j}(X, \mathbb{Q})$. The hypercohomology $\mathbb{H}^i(X, \mathbb{Z}(n)[2n])$ is precisely $H^{i-2n}_{mot}(X, \mathbb{Z}(n))$. Therefore, the question is a direct recall of a major theorem. This violates **Guideline 6 (Originality)** and **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning)**.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Do not ask for the theorem statement. Instead, provide a concrete scenario or a slightly modified setup where a component of the BLV theorem (or a related result) needs to be applied, combined with other knowledge, to yield a specific symbolic result. For example, ask about specific parts of the spectral sequence relating algebraic K-theory to motivic cohomology in a particular degree, or how a specific invariant of a variety might be expressed using both theories.

---

**Question 5 Critique:**
"Consider a triangulated category $\mathcal{T}$ and a $t$-structure $(\mathcal{T}_{\leq 0}, \mathcal{T}_{\geq 0})$ on $\mathcal{T}$. Let $\mathcal{C} = \mathcal{T}_{\leq 0} \cap \mathcal{T}_{\geq 0}$ be the heart of the $t$-structure. Express the condition that the $t$-structure is non-degenerate (i.e., $\bigcap_n \mathcal{T}_{\leq n} = \bigcap_n \mathcal{T}_{\geq -n} = \{0\}$) in terms of vanishing conditions on the Ext functors between objects in $\mathcal{C}$."

*   **Critique:** This question asks for a well-known characterization of non-degenerate (or bounded) $t$-structures in terms of Ext vanishing between objects in the heart. This is a standard definition or a basic theorem in the theory of $t$-structures (e.g., $Ext^i(A,B) = 0$ for $A,B \in \mathcal{C}$ and $i<0$ or $i>0$ for various formulations of non-degeneracy/boundedness properties). It tests direct recall rather than requiring multi-step reasoning or application in a novel context. Thus, it violates **Guideline 6 (Originality)** and **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning)**.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Frame a problem that requires applying this characterization to a *specific* triangulated category (e.g., derived category of sheaves on a variety, stable homotopy category) and a *specific* $t$-structure. Ask to deduce properties of the heart or Ext groups that are not immediately obvious from the general statement, requiring some intermediate steps or contextual understanding.

Okay, here are the revised questions, addressing the feedback to increase their complexity and originality, and reduce reliance on direct recall of definitions or theorems:

1.  <question>Let $X$ be a smooth, proper variety over $\mathbb{C}$ with $H^1(X, \mathbb{C}) = 0$. Suppose $\alpha \in CH^2(X)$ is a cycle such that $cl(\alpha) \in H^{4}_{mot}(X, \mathbb{Q})$ is torsion. Show that for any ample divisor $H$ on $X$, there exists an integer $n > 0$ such that $n (\alpha \cdot H^{\dim(X) - 2}) = 0$ in $CH^0(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}$. (Here, $cl$ is the cycle class map and $\cdot$ denotes the intersection product.)</question>

2.  <question>Consider the quotient stack $[\mathbb{A}^2/G]$, where $G = \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ acts on $\mathbb{A}^2 = Spec(k[x,y])$ via $(x,y) \mapsto (-x, -y)$, where $k$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic not equal to 2. Compute the dimension of the étale cohomology group $H^2_{et}([\mathbb{A}^2/G], \mathbb{Q}_{\ell})$ using the isomorphism between the étale cohomology of the quotient stack and the G-equivariant cohomology of $\mathbb{A}^2$.</question>

3.  <question>Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over a field $k$, and let $K(X)$ denote the algebraic K-theory spectrum of $X$. Consider the Nisnevich sheaf represented by $K(X)$, denoted by $\mathcal{K}(X)$. Use the Čech spectral sequence associated to the Nisnevich covering $X \sqcup X \to X$ to identify the $E_2^{p,q}$ term for $p = 0, 1$ and all $q$ when the Nisnevich sheaf is applied to X. How does the motivic homotopy axiom help simplify this computation? </question>

4.  <question>Let $X = \mathbb{P}^n$ and consider the motivic complex $\mathbb{Z}(1)$. Using the Bloch-Lichtenbaum-Voevodsky spectral sequence, show that the natural map $K_0(X) \to \mathbb{H}^0(X, \mathbb{Z}(0))$ is surjective. (Hint: Relate this to the Picard group of X and the Chow groups.)</question>

5.  <question>Let $\mathcal{T} = D^b(Coh(X))$ be the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a smooth projective variety $X$. This category admits a standard t-structure whose heart is $Coh(X)$, the category of coherent sheaves. Suppose that $\mathcal{T}$ also has another t-structure with heart $\mathcal{C}$. Assuming this t-structure is non-degenerate, and that $\mathcal{C}$ is Noetherian and Artinian, prove that $\mathcal{C}$ has finite length, i.e., any object in $\mathcal{C}$ has a composition series of finite length.</question>
=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of each question against the provided guidelines:

**Question 1:**
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 3 & 4 (Solvable Target & Single Output):** Fails. The question asks to "Show that...", which requires a proof or derivation, not a clear symbolic result or a single, unambiguous symbolic answer.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Pass. It's a single statement to prove.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Rephrase the question to ask for a specific computed value, quantity, or algebraic object, rather than asking for a proof of a statement. For example, instead of "Show that A implies B", ask "What is the specific integer $n$ that satisfies a certain property for $\alpha \cdot H^{\dim(X)-2}$ under these conditions?"

**Question 2:**
*   **Critique:**
    *   **All Guidelines:** Pass. This question asks for a specific numeric dimension, which is a clear symbolic result, and requires multi-step reasoning within a well-defined setup. It is a single, unambiguous target.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** This question is well-aligned with all guidelines. No specific feedback is needed.

**Question 3:**
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 3 & 4 (Solvable Target & Single Output):** Fails. The second part, "How does the motivic homotopy axiom help simplify this computation?", asks for an explanation or derivation of a simplification, not a direct symbolic result.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Fails. The question explicitly has two distinct parts: "identify the $E_2^{p,q}$ term" and "How does the motivic homotopy axiom help simplify this computation?".
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   Separate this into two distinct questions if both concepts are essential.
    *   Rephrase the "How does...?" part to ask for a specific, unambiguous symbolic consequence or simplified form due to the axiom, rather than an explanation.

**Question 4:**
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 3 & 4 (Solvable Target & Single Output):** Fails. The question asks to "show that...", which requires a proof or derivation, not a clear symbolic result or a single, unambiguous symbolic answer.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Pass. It's a single statement to prove.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Rephrase the question to ask for a specific value, structure, or identification of an algebraic object related to the map, rather than asking to prove its surjectivity. For example, "Identify the kernel of the natural map $K_0(X) \to \mathbb{H}^0(X, \mathbb{Z}(0))$ for $X = \mathbb{P}^n$."

**Question 5:**
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 3 & 4 (Solvable Target & Single Output):** Fails. The question asks to "prove that...", which requires a derivation, not a clear symbolic result or a single, unambiguous symbolic answer.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Weak Pass/Fail. The core statement (Noetherian + Artinian implies finite length) is a standard theorem in abelian categories. While framed within t-structures, the problem might be considered a direct re-statement of a known result as a proof.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Pass. It's a single statement to prove.
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   Rephrase the question to ask for a property, a construction, or a counterexample under modified conditions, rather than proving a known theorem. For instance, "Under what minimal additional conditions (beyond non-degenerate) can one guarantee that the heart $\mathcal{C}$ has finite length, if it is not necessarily Noetherian and Artinian?"
    *   To enhance originality, the question could involve constructing such a t-structure or analyzing its properties for a specific $X$.
=== Turn 2: Author refines questions ===
Okay, here are the revised questions, taking into account your feedback. The aim is to move away from asking for proofs and focus on questions with specific, computable answers or concrete objects as output.

1.  <question>Let $X$ be a smooth, proper variety over $\mathbb{C}$ with $H^1(X, \mathbb{C}) = 0$. Suppose $\alpha \in CH^2(X)$ is a cycle such that $cl(\alpha) \in H^{4}_{mot}(X, \mathbb{Q})$ is torsion. Let $H$ be an ample divisor on $X$ and let $d = \dim(X)$.  Determine the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n (\alpha \cdot H^{d - 2}) = 0$ in $CH^0(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, assuming $\alpha$ is represented by the class of a surface $S \subset X$ such that the geometric Picard rank of $S$ is 1 and $H$ restricted to $S$ is very ample. If no such integer exists, explain why.</question>

2.  <question>Consider the quotient stack $[\mathbb{A}^2/G]$, where $G = \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ acts on $\mathbb{A}^2 = Spec(k[x,y])$ via $(x,y) \mapsto (-x, -y)$, where $k$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic not equal to 2. Compute the dimension of the étale cohomology group $H^2_{et}([\mathbb{A}^2/G], \mathbb{Q}_{\ell})$ using the isomorphism between the étale cohomology of the quotient stack and the G-equivariant cohomology of $\mathbb{A}^2$.</question>

3.  <question>Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over a field $k$, and let $K(X)$ denote the algebraic K-theory spectrum of $X$. Consider the Nisnevich sheaf represented by $K(X)$, denoted by $\mathcal{K}(X)$. Use the Čech spectral sequence associated to the Nisnevich covering $X \sqcup X \to X$ to identify the $E_2^{0,0}$ and $E_2^{1,0}$ terms when the Nisnevich sheaf is applied to X.  If the motivic homotopy axiom implies that the Nisnevich sheaf associated to $K(X)$ satisfies $\mathcal{K}(X)(\mathbb{A}^1_X) \cong \mathcal{K}(X)(X)$, then what are the resulting $E_2^{0,0}$ and $E_2^{1,0}$ terms? </question>

4.  <question>Let $X = \mathbb{P}^n$ and consider the motivic complex $\mathbb{Z}(1)$. Using the Bloch-Lichtenbaum-Voevodsky spectral sequence, determine the kernel of the natural map $K_0(X) \to \mathbb{H}^0(X, \mathbb{Z}(0))$. Express your answer in terms of the Chow groups of $X$.</question>

5.  <question>Let $\mathcal{T} = D^b(Coh(X))$ be the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a smooth projective variety $X$. This category admits a standard t-structure whose heart is $Coh(X)$, the category of coherent sheaves. Suppose that $\mathcal{T}$ also has another non-degenerate t-structure with heart $\mathcal{C}$.  Assume that $\mathcal{C}$ is Noetherian and Artinian. Given a specific object $A$ in $\mathcal{C}$, explicitly describe a composition series of finite length for $A$. What is the maximum possible length of such a composition series in terms of invariants of $X$ or $\mathcal{C}$?</question>
