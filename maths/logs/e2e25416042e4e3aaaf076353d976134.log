Here are some novel university-level mathematics questions, based on the provided topics, concepts, and guidelines:

1.  <question>Consider an infinite discrete system of masses $u_i$, $i \in \mathbb{Z}$, connected by springs. The displacement of the $i$-th mass from its equilibrium position is given by $u_i$. The restoring force on the $i$-th mass depends nonlocally on the displacements of all other masses according to the difference equation

 $$-\Delta u_i = \sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty} J_{ij}(u_i - u_j) = f_i,$$

 where $\Delta u_i = u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}$, $f_i$ is an external force applied to the $i$-th mass, and $J_{ij} = J_{ji} > 0$ represents the coupling strength between masses $i$ and $j$, with $J_{ii} = 0$.  Assume the $J_{ij}$ decay rapidly as $|i-j|$ increases, specifically, $J_{ij} = \frac{1}{(1 + (i-j)^2)^2}$.  Suppose $f_i = \delta_{i,0}$, where $\delta_{i,0}$ is the Kronecker delta. Find the value of $u_0$ in terms of a converging infinite sum, assuming the solution $u_i$ is unique and exists in a suitable Hilbert space. Express your answer using the resolvent operator for a related compact operator.</question>

2.  <question>Let $H$ be a real Hilbert space, and let $B \subset H$ be a closed ball of radius $R > 0$ centered at the origin. Define a functional $F: B \to \mathbb{R}$ by

 $$F(u) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i \|u - v_i\|^2,$$

 where $a_i > 0$ are constants, and $v_i \in H$ are fixed vectors with $\|v_i\| > R$ for all $i=1,\ldots, N$. Assume that $\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i = 1$. Determine the minimum value of $F(u)$ on $B$. Express your answer in terms of $a_i, v_i$ and $R$, potentially involving the projection operator onto $B$.</question>

3.  <question>Consider the discrete eigenvalue problem for a function $u_i$ defined on the integers $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$, subject to the nonlocal boundary condition $\sum_{i=1}^N u_i = 0$. The eigenvalue problem is given by:

 $$-\Delta u_i = \lambda u_i, \quad i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\},$$

 where $\Delta u_i = u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}$ with $u_0 = u_{N+1} = 0$ . Find the smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_1 > 0$ that satisfies the equation and the nonlocal boundary condition. Express $\lambda_1$ as a closed form expression involving trigonometric functions and $N$.</question>

4.  <question>Let $u_n$ be a sequence defined by the difference equation

  $$u_{n+1} = a u_n + b u_{n-1}, \quad n \ge 1,$$

  with initial conditions $u_0 = 1$ and $u_1 = a$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers such that $a^2 + 4b > 0$ and $b \ne 0$. Define the generating function $U(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty u_n z^n$. Find a closed-form expression for $U(z)$.</question>

5.  <question>Consider the nonlocal discrete problem:

  $$-u_{i+1} + 2u_i - u_{i-1} = f_i + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^N u_j, \quad i = 1, 2, \dots, N,$$

  with boundary conditions $u_0 = u_{N+1} = 0$, where $f_i$ are given values, and $\alpha$ is a constant. Find the value of $\sum_{j=1}^N u_j$ in terms of $f_i$, $N$, and $\alpha$. Assume that $2N+1+\alpha N(N+1) \neq 0$.</question>

### Question 1 Critique:

1.  **Input Format:** Meets. Fully text-based.
2.  **Mathematical Structure:** Meets. Well-defined idealized system.
3.  **Solvable Target:** Meets. Asks for a clear symbolic result ($u_0$).
4.  **Single Output:** Meets. Asks for a single value.
5.  **Concise and Relevant:** **Needs improvement.** The phrase "Express your answer using the resolvent operator for a related compact operator" is highly prescriptive. While it guides the student towards a specific advanced technique, it dictates *how* the problem should be solved rather than allowing the student to discover the method as part of the multi-step reasoning. It reduces the scope for originality in the student's approach.
6.  **Originality:** Meets. The infinite discrete system with specific nonlocal coupling $J_{ij}$ is novel and non-trivial.
7.  **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Meets, but the prescriptive hint in point 5 slightly detracts from the student's required reasoning to *identify* the method.
8.  **Solution Formatting:** Meets. Correct LaTeX/Markdown.
9.  **Language and Notation:** Meets. Rigorous and consistent.
10. **No Multiple Parts:** Meets. Single request.
11. **No Answers/Solutions:** Meets. No solutions provided.
12. **No Numeric Approximations:** Meets. Asks for a sum.

**Actionable Feedback:** Remove the prescriptive hint "Express your answer using the resolvent operator for a related compact operator." The question should challenge students to determine the appropriate mathematical tools themselves. If the problem is truly unsolvable without this hint, consider if the problem's scope is appropriate.

### Question 2 Critique:

1.  **Input Format:** Meets. Fully text-based.
2.  **Mathematical Structure:** Meets. Well-defined functional on a Hilbert space.
3.  **Solvable Target:** Meets. Asks for a clear symbolic result (minimum value).
4.  **Single Output:** Meets. Asks for a single value.
5.  **Concise and Relevant:** **Needs improvement.** Similar to Question 1, "potentially involving the projection operator onto B" is a prescriptive hint. It points directly to a key mathematical tool for solving constrained optimization problems, thereby reducing the intellectual demand on the student to identify the appropriate method.
6.  **Originality:** Meets. While convex optimization over a ball is standard, the specific form of the functional with $v_i$ outside the ball makes it non-trivial and interesting.
7.  **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Meets, but the hint in point 5 slightly lessens the required reasoning.
8.  **Solution Formatting:** Meets. Correct LaTeX/Markdown.
9.  **Language and Notation:** Meets. Rigorous and consistent.
10. **No Multiple Parts:** Meets. Single request.
11. **No Answers/Solutions:** Meets. No solutions provided.

### Question 3 Critique:

1.  **Input Format:** Meets. Fully text-based.
2.  **Mathematical Structure:** Meets. Well-defined discrete eigenvalue problem.
3.  **Solvable Target:** Meets. Asks for a clear symbolic result ($\lambda_1$).
4.  **Single Output:** Meets. Asks for a single value.
5.  **Concise and Relevant:** Meets. All information is essential and relevant. The nonlocal boundary condition is a core part of the problem's challenge.
6.  **Originality:** Meets. While the discrete Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions is standard, the additional nonlocal boundary condition $\sum_{i=1}^N u_i = 0$ introduces a unique and non-trivial twist that differentiates it from textbook problems.
7.  **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Meets. Requires solving a standard problem and then applying an additional constraint, which is a good test of understanding.
8.  **Solution Formatting:** Meets. Correct LaTeX/Markdown.
9.  **Language and Notation:** Meets. Rigorous and consistent.
10. **No Multiple Parts:** Meets. Single request.
11. **No Answers/Solutions:** Meets. No solutions provided.
12. **No Numeric Approximations:** Meets. Asks for a closed form.

**Actionable Feedback:** This question is very well-designed and meets all guidelines effectively. No significant improvements needed.

### Question 4 Critique:

1.  **Input Format:** Meets. Fully text-based.
2.  **Mathematical Structure:** Meets. Well-defined linear recurrence relation.
3.  **Solvable Target:** Meets. Asks for a clear symbolic result ($U(z)$).
4.  **Single Output:** Meets. Asks for a single function.
5.  **Concise and Relevant:** Meets. All conditions ($a^2+4b>0$, $b \neq 0$) are relevant for the form of the solution. The initial conditions are also specific and relevant.
6.  **Originality:** **Needs improvement.** Finding the generating function for a linear recurrence relation is a very standard technique taught in many undergraduate courses (e.g., discrete mathematics, combinatorics). While the specific parameters might lead to a unique numeric answer, the *method* is a direct application of a textbook procedure. The initial conditions $u_0=1, u_1=a$ are particularly chosen to simplify the numerator of the generating function, which makes it even more of a standard exercise.
7.  **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Meets, but the steps are very standard for this type of problem, making it less "non-trivial" in terms of conceptual difficulty compared to the other questions.
8.  **Solution Formatting:** Meets. Correct LaTeX/Markdown.
9.  **Language and Notation:** Meets. Rigorous and consistent.
10. **No Multiple Parts:** Meets. Single request.
11. **No Answers/Solutions:** Meets. No solutions provided.
12. **No Numeric Approximations:** Meets. Asks for a closed form.

**Actionable Feedback:** To enhance originality, consider altering the initial conditions ($u_0, u_1$) to make the algebraic manipulation less straightforward or to introduce a minor additional conceptual hurdle (e.g., a recurrence with a constant term). This would make it less of a direct textbook application.

### Question 5 Critique:

1.  **Input Format:** Meets. Fully text-based.
2.  **Mathematical Structure:** Meets. Well-defined discrete linear system with a nonlocal term.
3.  **Solvable Target:** Meets. Asks for a clear symbolic result ($\sum_{j=1}^N u_j$).
4.  **Single Output:** Meets. Asks for a single value.
5.  **Concise and Relevant:** Meets. All information, including the solvability condition, is essential and relevant.
6.  **Originality:** Meets. It builds on the standard discrete Laplacian but introduces a unique nonlocal coupling in the source term, making it novel and non-trivial.
7.  **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Meets. Requires understanding of discrete operators and handling nonlocal terms, likely through summation or matrix inversion techniques.
8.  **Solution Formatting:** Meets. Correct LaTeX/Markdown.
9.  **Language and Notation:** Meets. Rigorous and consistent.
10. **No Multiple Parts:** Meets. Single request.
11. **No Answers/Solutions:** Meets. No solutions provided.

 $$-\Delta u_i = \sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty} J_{ij}(u_i - u_j) = f_i,$$

 where $\Delta u_i = u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}$, $f_i$ is an external force applied to the $i$-th mass, and $J_{ij} = J_{ji} > 0$ represents the coupling strength between masses $i$ and $j$, with $J_{ii} = 0$.

=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of each question against the provided guidelines:

**Question 1:**

*   **Critique:** This question is well-posed and aligns very well with all the guidelines. It presents a challenging, non-trivial problem that requires a deep understanding of discrete systems, nonlocal operators, and Fourier analysis for infinite domains. The setup is clear, the target is specific, and the assumptions are appropriately stated to ensure solvability.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** No improvements needed. This question is excellent.

**Question 2:**

*   **Critique:** This question is also very well-designed. It defines a clear optimization problem in a Hilbert space with specific constraints that make it non-trivial. The functional is convex, and the boundary condition on $v_i$ with respect to $R$ implies that the unconstrained minimum lies outside the ball, forcing the solution onto the boundary. It effectively tests understanding of functional analysis and optimization principles.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** No improvements needed. This question is excellent.

**Question 3:**

*   **Critique:** This question presents a discrete eigenvalue problem, which is good. However, there is a potential ambiguity in the boundary conditions. The problem states "$-\Delta u_i = \lambda u_i, \quad i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\},$ where $\Delta u_i = u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}$ with $u_0 = u_{N+1} = 0$." This clearly defines a standard discrete Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Then it adds, "subject to the nonlocal boundary condition $\sum_{i=1}^N u_i = 0$."
    *   If $u_0 = u_{N+1} = 0$ are the *primary* boundary conditions, then the "nonlocal boundary condition" acts as an additional *constraint* on the valid eigenfunctions. This means the problem asks for eigenvalues $\lambda_k$ (from the standard Dirichlet problem) whose corresponding eigenfunctions $u^{(k)}$ also satisfy $\sum_{i=1}^N u_i^{(k)} = 0$. This interpretation could lead to situations where no such non-trivial eigenfunctions exist for certain $N$, or only for very specific $\lambda_k$ values, making the "smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_1 > 0$" ill-defined or very hard to determine in a simple closed form.
    *   If the nonlocal condition is meant to *replace* one of the Dirichlet conditions (e.g., $u_0=0$ and $\sum u_i = 0$ as the two conditions), then the problem changes significantly. But the phrasing "with $u_0 = u_{N+1} = 0$" strongly suggests these are fixed.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Clarify the exact nature of the boundary conditions. If $u_0 = u_{N+1} = 0$ are the operative boundary conditions for the discrete Laplacian, then specify that the sum condition is a *filter* or *additional requirement* on the eigenfunctions. If this is the case, ensure that a smallest positive eigenvalue satisfying all conditions always exists for all $N$ to avoid an ill-posed problem.

**Question 4:**

*   **Critique:** This question is well-structured and technically correct in its formulation. However, it violates Guideline 6: "Originality: Ensure the problem is unique and non-trivial. Avoid rewording standard textbook problems." Finding the generating function for a linear homogeneous recurrence relation with constant coefficients and given initial conditions is a very standard and common problem found in introductory textbooks on combinatorics, discrete mathematics, or generating functions. The specific values of $a, b, u_0, u_1$ and the condition $a^2+4b>0$ do not make it sufficiently unique or non-trivial.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To improve originality, consider introducing a non-homogeneous term to the recurrence, making it a system of recurrence relations, or embedding the generating function task within a larger problem that requires more steps or a more sophisticated application of generating functions.

**Question 5:**

*   **Critique:** This question is excellent. It presents a discrete problem with a nonlocal term, which is a good example of a non-standard yet solvable problem. The request to find the sum $\sum_{j=1}^N u_j$ rather than the individual $u_i$ is a clever twist that allows for a concise solution method (summing the equation over $i$). The conditions are clear, and the necessary non-zero assumption ensures solvability.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** No improvements needed. This question is excellent.

 where $\Delta u_i = u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}$, $f_i$ is an external force applied to the $i$-th mass, and $J_{ij} = J_{ji} > 0$ represents the coupling strength between masses $i$ and $j$, with $J_{ii} = 0$.  Assume the $J_{ij}$ decay rapidly as $|i-j|$ increases, specifically, $J_{ij} = \frac{1}{(1 + (i-j)^2)^2}$.  Suppose $f_i = \delta_{i,0}$, where $\delta_{i,0}$ is the Kronecker delta.

 $$F(u) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i \|u - v_i\|^2,$$

 where $a_i > 0$ are constants, and $v_i \in H$ are fixed vectors with $\|v_i\| > R$ for all $i=1,\ldots, N$. Assume that $\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i = 1$. Determine the minimum value of $F(u)$ on $B$. Express your answer in terms of $a_i, v_i$ and $R$.</question>

 where $\Delta u_i = u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}$ with boundary conditions $u_0 = u_{N+1} = 0$. *Furthermore*, we require that the eigenfunction also satisfies the constraint $\sum_{i=1}^N u_i = 0$.  Assuming such a solution exists for some $\lambda > 0$, find the smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_1 > 0$ that satisfies both the equation and this constraint. Express $\lambda_1$ as a closed form expression involving trigonometric functions and $N$.  If no such eigenvalue exists, explain why.</question>

 $$u_{n+1} = a u_n + b u_{n-1}, \quad n \ge 1,$$

 with initial conditions $u_0 = 2$ and $u_1 = a+1$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers such that $a^2 + 4b > 0$ and $b \ne 0$. Now, let $v_n = u_n + c \cdot n$, where $c$ is a constant. Find the generating function $V(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty v_n z^n$ in closed form. Express your answer in terms of $a, b, c$ and $z$.</question>

5.  <question>Consider the nonlocal discrete problem:

  $$-u_{i+1} + 2u_i - u_{i-1} = f_i + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^N u_j, \quad i = 1, 2, \dots, N,$$

  with boundary conditions $u_0 = u_{N+1} = 0$, where $f_i$ are given values, and $\alpha$ is a constant. Find the value of $\sum_{j=1}^N u_j$ in terms of $f_i$, $N$, and $\alpha$. Assume that $2N+1+\alpha N(N+1) \neq 0$.</question>

**Question 3:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Input Format):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 2 (Mathematical Structure):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** Fail. The phrase "If no such eigenvalue exists, explain why" asks for a justification/derivation rather than a clear symbolic result, violating the spirit of "Questions must not be proves or derivations."
*   **Guideline 4 (Single Output):** Fail. The question expects either a symbolic expression for $\lambda_1$ or an explanation, making the output conditional and not a single, unambiguous symbolic answer.
*   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** Pass, but the conditional part of the question (criticized above) adds unnecessary branching.

*   **Guideline 12 (No Numeric Approximations/Computational Tools):** Pass.

**Critique for Question 3:**
The main issue is the conditional "If no such eigenvalue exists, explain why." This deviates from the requirement for a single symbolic output and avoids proofs/derivations.

**Actionable Feedback for Question 3:**
Remove the conditional clause: "If no such eigenvalue exists, explain why." Rephrase to simply ask for the smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_1 > 0$ that satisfies both conditions (implicitly assuming such an eigenvalue exists). For example: "Find the smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_1 > 0$ that satisfies both the equation and this constraint. Express $\lambda_1$ as a closed form expression involving trigonometric functions and $N$."

 $$-\Delta u_i = \sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty} J_{ij}(u_i - u_j) = f_i,$$

 where $\Delta u_i = u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}$, $f_i$ is an external force applied to the $i$-th mass, and $J_{ij} = J_{ji} > 0$ represents the coupling strength between masses $i$ and $j$, with $J_{ii} = 0$.  Assume the $J_{ij}$ decay rapidly as $|i-j|$ increases, specifically, $J_{ij} = \frac{1}{(1 + (i-j)^2)^2}$.  Suppose $f_i = \delta_{i,0}$, where $\delta_{i,0}$ is the Kronecker delta. Find the value of $u_0$ in terms of a converging infinite sum, assuming the solution $u_i$ is unique and exists in a suitable Hilbert space.</question>

2.  <question>Let $H$ be a real Hilbert space, and let $B \subset H$ be a closed ball of radius $R > 0$ centered at the origin. Define a functional $F: B \to \mathbb{R}$ by

 $$F(u) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i \|u - v_i\|^2,$$

 where $a_i > 0$ are constants, and $v_i \in H$ are fixed vectors with $\|v_i\| > R$ for all $i=1,\ldots, N$. Assume that $\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i = 1$. Determine the minimum value of $F(u)$ on $B$. Express your answer in terms of $a_i, v_i$ and $R$.</question>

3.  <question>Consider the discrete eigenvalue problem for a function $u_i$ defined on the integers $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$. The eigenvalue problem is given by:

 $$-\Delta u_i = \lambda u_i, \quad i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\},$$

 where $\Delta u_i = u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}$ with boundary conditions $u_0 = u_{N+1} = 0$. *Furthermore*, we require that the eigenfunction also satisfies the constraint $\sum_{i=1}^N u_i = 0$. Assuming such a solution exists for some $\lambda > 0$, find the smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_1 > 0$ that satisfies both the equation and this constraint. Express $\lambda_1$ as a closed form expression involving trigonometric functions and $N$.</question>

4.  <question>Consider the sequence $u_n$ defined by the recurrence relation

 $$u_{n+1} = a u_n + b u_{n-1}, \quad n \ge 1,$$

 with initial conditions $u_0 = 2$ and $u_1 = a+1$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers such that $a^2 + 4b > 0$ and $b \ne 0$. Now, let $v_n = u_n + c \cdot n$, where $c$ is a constant. Find the generating function $V(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty v_n z^n$ in closed form. Express your answer in terms of $a, b, c$ and $z$.</question>

5.  <question>Consider the nonlocal discrete problem:

  $$-u_{i+1} + 2u_i - u_{i-1} = f_i + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^N u_j, \quad i = 1, 2, \dots, N,$$

  with boundary conditions $u_0 = u_{N+1} = 0$, where $f_i$ are given values, and $\alpha$ is a constant. Find the value of $\sum_{j=1}^N u_j$ in terms of $f_i$, $N$, and $\alpha$. Assume that $2N+1+\alpha N(N+1) \neq 0$.</question>
