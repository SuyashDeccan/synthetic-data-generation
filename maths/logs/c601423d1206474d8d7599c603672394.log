=== Turn 0: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of each question based on your guidelines:

**Question 1:**
*   **Critique:** The phrasing "what is the dimension of $\rho$? Express your answer in terms of $n$" can be misleading. Based on the condition that the induced character decomposes into two irreducible characters, this implies $\rho$ must be 1-dimensional, regardless of $n$ (for $n \ge 1$). If the answer is indeed a constant, expressing it "in terms of $n$" is redundant or serves as a distractor. Furthermore, the question asks for "the dimension of $\rho$" (an irreducible representation of $G$), but $G$ (specifically $D_n$ for $n>2$) can have multiple types of irreducible representations with different dimensions (e.g., 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional). The context implies $\rho$ is one of the *components resulting from the specified decomposition*, which forces its dimension to be 1.
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    1.  Clarify that $\rho$ refers specifically to one of the irreducible components resulting from the decomposition of the induced representation.
    2.  Re-evaluate the "in terms of $n$" requirement. If the answer is a constant, this phrase should be removed or rephrased (e.g., "Determine the dimension of $\rho$.").

**Question 2:**
*   **Critique:** The statement "assuming $\sum_{g \in G} |\chi_\rho(g)|^2 = |G|$" is a fundamental property of irreducible characters (one of the orthogonality relations) and is always true for any irreducible character $\chi_\rho$. Therefore, it is redundant and does not represent an "assumption."
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Remove the redundant statement "assuming $\sum_{g \in G} |\chi_\rho(g)|^2 = |G|$."

**Question 3:**
*   **Critique:** This question is well-posed, clear, and adheres to all guidelines. It asks for a specific value using standard definitions and calculations.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** No improvements needed.

**Question 4:**
*   **Critique:** This question is well-posed, clear, and adheres to all guidelines. It tests understanding of central idempotents and isotypic components in representation theory.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** No improvements needed.

**Question 5:**
*   **Critique:** This question is well-posed, clear, and adheres to all guidelines. It requires applying knowledge of induced representations, restriction, and the structure of representations for specific semidirect products.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** No improvements needed.

1.  <question>Consider the semidirect product $G = \mathbb{Z}_2 \ltimes \mathbb{Z}_n$, where the action of $\mathbb{Z}_2 = \{1, a\}$ on $\mathbb{Z}_n = \{1, b, b^2, \dots, b^{n-1}\}$ is given by $a b a^{-1} = b^{-1}$.

=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of each question based on the provided guidelines:

**Question 1:**
*   **Critique:** This question is well-posed and aligns with most guidelines. It sets up a standard semidirect product and asks for the dimension of an irreducible component of an induced representation under a specific decomposition condition. The problem requires understanding induced representations, their dimensions, and how they decompose. The unique answer is $1$, which makes it unambiguous.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** No specific improvements needed; it is a good, solvable question.

**Question 2:**
*   **Critique:** This question attempts to build on standard character theory results but likely falls short on solvability as stated. The requested sum $\sum_{i=1}^{k} \omega_\rho(K_i)^2$ (not absolute value squared) does not generally simplify to a closed form solely in terms of $|G|$ and $\chi_\rho(1)$. The standard orthogonality relations involve $|\chi_\rho(g)|^2$, not $\chi_\rho(g)^2$. Unless there's a highly specialized identity or a specific type of group implied, this sum cannot be expressed in the requested terms. Additionally, providing the explicit formula for $\omega_\rho(K_i)$ reduces the multi-step reasoning aspect by making it a direct substitution, although the simplification of the sum itself would require non-trivial reasoning if it *were* solvable.
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** The requested sum $\sum_{i=1}^{k} \omega_\rho(K_i)^2$ is unlikely to have a general expression solely in terms of $|G|$ and $\chi_\rho(1)$, making it potentially unsolvable as posed. Reconsider the target sum; a common variation, for example, is $\sum_{i=1}^{k} |\omega_\rho(K_i)|^2$, which does simplify nicely.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** Providing the formula for $\omega_\rho(K_i)$ reduces the problem to a substitution task, rather than requiring the recall or derivation of this standard property. Consider omitting it if it's considered foundational knowledge for the target audience.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** As currently posed, if the sum doesn't simplify, it fails to elicit multi-step reasoning leading to a concise solution. If it's rephrased to a solvable sum, it would better meet this guideline.

**Question 3:**
*   **Critique:** This question is a very direct and standard application of the induced character formula (Mackey's formula for induced characters). While it requires applying a formula, it's almost a definition recall in a specific context. This limits its originality and the depth of multi-step reasoning required beyond simply plugging values into a known formula.
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** The problem is a highly standard and common application of the induced character formula for a small semidirect product. Consider adding a unique constraint or combining it with another concept to enhance originality.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** While it involves a formula, the application is very direct, limiting the depth of multi-step reasoning required. A more challenging application of the formula or a problem requiring analysis of group structure before applying the formula would be beneficial.

**Question 4:**
*   **Critique:** This question directly asks for a definition or a very fundamental property of central idempotents and isotypic components. The projection of a module onto its isotypic component $V_\rho$ is, by definition, multiplication by $e_\rho$. This question essentially tests recall of notation/definition rather than multi-step reasoning.
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** The question asks for a direct definition/property of central idempotents and isotypic components, which significantly lacks originality.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** This question does not require multi-step reasoning. It is a direct recall of a fundamental definition/property. It needs to be rephrased to require a sequence of logical steps.

**Question 5:**
*   **Critique:** This is a good, challenging question that requires a solid understanding of induced representations, restrictions, Clifford's Theorem (or detailed Mackey's formula application), and group actions on characters. It requires analyzing the group structure, the action of the quotient group on the normal subgroup's characters, and relating the decomposition of the restricted representation to the properties of induced representations. It has a single, unambiguous numeric answer.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** No specific improvements needed; it is a strong question.

<question>Consider the semidirect product $G = \mathbb{Z}_2 \ltimes \mathbb{Z}_n$, where the action of $\mathbb{Z}_2 = \{1, a\}$ on $\mathbb{Z}_n = \{1, b, b^2, \dots, b^{n-1}\}$ is given by $a b a^{-1} = b^{-1}$. Let $\chi$ be a character of an irreducible representation of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and consider the induced representation $\text{Ind}_{\mathbb{Z}_n}^G(\chi)$. Suppose $\text{Ind}_{\mathbb{Z}_n}^G(\chi)$ decomposes into a sum of two irreducible characters of $G$, and let $\rho$ be one of the irreducible representations appearing in this decomposition. What is the dimension of $\rho$?</question>

<question>Let $G$ be a finite group and $\mathbb{C}[G]$ its group algebra. Suppose $C_1, \dots, C_k$ are the conjugacy classes of $G$, and let $K_i \in \mathbb{C}[G]$ be the class sum corresponding to $C_i$. Given that the center $Z(\mathbb{C}[G])$ of the group algebra is spanned by $K_1, \dots, K_k$,  consider the central character $\omega_\rho: Z(\mathbb{C}[G]) \to \mathbb{C}$ associated with an irreducible representation $\rho$ of $G$.  Prove that $\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{|C_i|^2 |\chi_\rho(g_i)|^2}{\chi_\rho(1)^2} = |G|$, where $g_i \in C_i$ and $\chi_\rho$ is the character of $\rho$.</question>

<question>Let $G = \mathbb{Z}_2 \ltimes \mathbb{Z}_3$ be the semidirect product where $\mathbb{Z}_2 = \{e, a\}$ acts on $\mathbb{Z}_3 = \{e, b, b^2\}$ by $aba^{-1} = b^{-1}$. Consider the induced representation $\text{Ind}_{\mathbb{Z}_3}^G (\phi)$ where $\phi: \mathbb{Z}_3 \to \mathbb{C}$ is a non-trivial irreducible representation of $\mathbb{Z}_3$. Suppose that $\chi_{\text{Ind}}$ is the character of $\text{Ind}_{\mathbb{Z}_3}^G (\phi)$.  Determine the value of $\chi_{\text{Ind}}(a)$, and justify your result without directly invoking the induced character formula.</question>

<question>Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $\mathbb{C}[G]$ be its group algebra. Suppose $\rho$ is an irreducible representation of $G$ with character $\chi_\rho$. Let $e_\rho = \frac{\chi_\rho(1)}{|G|}\sum_{g \in G} \overline{\chi_\rho(g)}g$ be the central idempotent corresponding to $\rho$. Suppose $V$ is a finite-dimensional $\mathbb{C}[G]$-module, and $v \in V$. Prove that $e_\rho \cdot v$ lies in the isotypic component $V_\rho$ corresponding to $\rho$, and that if $v$ is already in $V_\rho$, then $e_\rho \cdot v = v$.</question>

<question>Consider the group $G = (\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z}) \rtimes (\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z})$ where the action of $(\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z})$ on $(\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z})$ is given by multiplication by $2$ (mod $5$). Suppose $\rho$ is an irreducible representation of $G$. If the restriction of $\rho$ to $(\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z})$ contains a non-trivial irreducible representation $\phi$ of $(\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z})$ exactly once, determine the dimension of $\rho$.</question>
```

Key changes and explanations:

*   **Question 2:**  Replaced the original question with a request to *prove* a relationship.  This forces the solver to understand the role of central characters and orthogonality relations.  The chosen relationship involves the sum of the *magnitudes squared* of the central character values, leading to a standard orthogonality relation that can be invoked. This makes the question solvable and requires multi-step reasoning. I removed the explicit formula for the central character to force the solver to recall/derive it.
*   **Question 3:** Changed "Compute the character..." to "Determine the value... and justify your result *without directly invoking the induced character formula*." This forces the solver to think about the underlying structure of the induced representation and its relation to the subgroup, rather than simply plugging into the formula. A valid solution could involve understanding the permutation representation associated with the cosets.
*   **Question 4:** Changed the problem from simply asking for the projection to asking to *prove* two properties of the projection. This forces the solver to understand the connection between the idempotent, the isotypic component, and the action of the idempotent on vectors within and outside the component. This requires a deeper understanding of the relationship rather than just stating the definition. I made the module finite-dimensional to avoid complications with infinite sums.
*   **Questions 1 and 5:** These remained largely unchanged as they were already reasonably well-posed.  Minor wording tweaks were made for clarity.
