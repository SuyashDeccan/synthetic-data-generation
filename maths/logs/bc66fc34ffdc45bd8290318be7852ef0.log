Here are some questions:

1. <question>Consider a probability density function $p(x)$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ given by $p(x) = Z^{-1} \exp(-\frac{1}{2} x^T A x)$, where $A$ is a symmetric positive definite matrix and $Z$ is the normalization constant. Let $y = Bx$ be a linear transformation, where $B$ is an invertible $n \times n$ matrix. Find the probability density function $q(y)$ of $y$ in terms of $y$, $B$, and $A$.

=== Turn 0: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of each question against the provided guidelines:

**Question 1:**
*   **Strengths:** Adheres well to Guidelines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 12. The problem is well-defined, asks for a clear symbolic result, is concise, uses correct LaTeX and standard mathematical notation, is a single-part question, and requires exact methods. It effectively demands multi-step reasoning (Guideline 7) involving Jacobian determinants and matrix algebra.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** This is a very common and fundamental problem in multivariate probability theory: finding the density function of a linear transformation of a multivariate Gaussian distribution. While a good test of understanding, it is a direct "rewording of a standard textbook problem."

**Question 2:**
*   **Strengths:** Adheres well to Guidelines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 12. The problem is clearly set up, asks for a precise symbolic/numeric result, is concise, uses proper LaTeX and standard notation, is a single-part question, and requires exact methods. It successfully requires multi-step reasoning (Guideline 7) involving properties of expectation, trace, and sample statistics.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Computing the expected value of the sample covariance matrix (or its trace) for independent and identically distributed standard normal variables is a canonical exercise in mathematical statistics. It directly falls under "rewording of a standard textbook problem."

**Question 3:**
*   **Strengths:** Adheres well to Guidelines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 12. The setup is clear, asks for a specific symbolic output, is concise, uses correct LaTeX and standard notation, is a single-part question, and requires exact methods.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** While dealing with kernel matrices is a valid domain, the specific condition "$x_1 = x_2 = \dots = x_n = x$" simplifies the kernel matrix $K$ to a matrix of all ones. This makes the calculation of $f^T K f$ very straightforward (it becomes $(\sum f_i)^2$). The problem becomes relatively trivial and lacks the "unique and non-trivial" aspect.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Due to the extreme simplification, the solution becomes a single, direct algebraic step after recognizing the structure of $K$. It does not strongly demand "multi-step reasoning" in a challenging sense.

**Question 4:**
*   **Strengths:** Adheres well to Guidelines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 12. The problem is well-defined, asks for a clear symbolic result, is concise, uses correct LaTeX and standard notation, is a single-part question, and requires exact methods.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Computing the Radon-Nikodym derivative between two measures with given density functions (especially two Gaussian densities) is a direct and standard application of its definition. It is a clear "rewording of a standard textbook problem."
    *   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** The computation primarily involves a single algebraic step of dividing the two density functions. This is not sufficiently "multi-step reasoning."

**Question 5:**
*   **Strengths:** Adheres well to Guidelines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 12. The problem is clearly defined, asks for a precise symbolic result, is concise, uses correct LaTeX and standard notation, is a single-part question, and requires exact methods. It effectively requires multi-step reasoning (Guideline 7) using either the CDF method or the change of variables formula.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** This is perhaps the most fundamental and classic example of the "transformation of random variables" problem commonly found in introductory probability textbooks. It is a quintessential "rewording of a standard textbook problem."

**Overall Feedback and Recommendations for Improvement:**

The questions consistently demonstrate strong adherence to guidelines regarding input format, mathematical structure, solvable target, single output, conciseness, formatting, language, single-part nature, and avoidance of approximations. This is excellent.

However, the most significant area for improvement across *all* questions is **Guideline 6 (Originality)**. Every question, while mathematically sound, is a direct application or slight variation of a standard textbook problem used to teach a specific concept. This means they are not "unique and non-trivial" in the sense of avoiding "rewording standard textbook problems."

Additionally, **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning)** is weak for Questions 3 and 4, where the provided conditions or definitions lead to overly direct solutions.

To improve, focus on:
1.  **Combining Concepts:** Design problems that require integrating knowledge from multiple distinct areas or theorems, rather than a direct application of one.
2.  **Introducing Subtle Complexities:** Instead of a simple linear transformation or a degenerate case, add a non-linearity, a conditional dependency, or a less obvious simplification.
3.  **Less Common Scenarios:** Use distributions or transformations that are not the absolute first examples taught in a textbook, or consider scenarios with parameters that lead to interesting boundary conditions.
4.  **Beyond Direct Definition Application:** For questions like Q4, aim for a scenario where the Radon-Nikodym derivative isn't a straightforward division of given functions but requires more manipulation or intermediate steps.

Okay, here are five revised probability questions, attempting to address the feedback regarding originality and multi-step reasoning. I've tried to move away from standard textbook examples and introduce complexities that require more integrated thinking.

1. <question>Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent random variables, both uniformly distributed on the interval $[0, 1]$.  Let $Z = \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2}$.  Find the probability density function of $Z$, denoted by $q(z)$, for $0 \leq z \leq \sqrt{2}$. Furthermore, compute $E[Z | Z \leq 1]$, the expected value of $Z$ conditional on the event that $Z$ is less than or equal to 1. Give $q(z)$ in terms of $z$, and the conditional expectation as a single numerical value.</question>

2. <question>Consider a symmetric random walk on the integers, starting at 0. Let $X_i$ be i.i.d. random variables taking values +1 and -1 with probability 1/2 each. Let $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ be the position after $n$ steps. Let $T = \min\{n \geq 1 : S_n = 10 \text{ or } S_n = -5\}$ be the first time the walk hits either +10 or -5.  Compute $E[T]$, the expected value of $T$.</question>

3. <question>Let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be independent random variables, where $X_i \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$ for $i = 1, \dots, n$.  Assume $\sigma^2$ is known. We want to test the hypothesis $H_0: \mu_1 = \dots = \mu_n$ against the alternative that at least two means are different.  Derive the likelihood ratio test statistic $\Lambda$ for this hypothesis test. Express your answer as a function of the data $X_1, \dots, X_n$ and $\sigma^2$. (You don't need to derive the distribution of $\Lambda$, just find the statistic itself.)</question>

4. <question>Let $X$ be a random variable taking values in $\{0, 1, 2, \dots\}$. Suppose $P(X = k) = c \cdot \frac{\lambda^k}{k! (k+1)}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \dots$, where $\lambda > 0$.
a) Find the value of the constant $c$ that makes this a valid probability mass function. Express your answer as a function of $\lambda$.
b) Compute $E[X]$. Express your answer as a function of $\lambda$ (you might need to leave the answer in terms of an infinite sum if a closed form solution is not easily obtainable).</question>

5. <question>Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be i.i.d. random variables from a uniform distribution on $[0, \theta]$, where $\theta > 0$ is unknown. We have two potential estimators for $\theta$: $\hat{\theta}_1 = 2 \bar{X}$ and $\hat{\theta}_2 = \frac{n+1}{n} X_{(n)}$, where $\bar{X}$ is the sample mean and $X_{(n)} = \max(X_1, X_2)$ is the sample maximum.
a) Calculate the bias of each estimator.
b) Find the mean squared error (MSE) of each estimator.
c) Based on your answers above, which estimator do you prefer and why?</question>
=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of the provided questions against your guidelines:

---

**Overall Feedback:**

The questions show a good attempt at incorporating multi-step reasoning and mathematical rigor. However, there's a consistent and significant violation of the guideline regarding "Single Output" and "No multiple parts" (Guideline 10/4), which is present in Questions 1, 4, and 5. There are also recurring issues with "Originality" (Guideline 6) and a direct violation of "No derivations" (Guideline 3) in Question 3.

---

**Question 1 Critique:**

*   **Guideline 4 (Single Output) & 10 (No Multiple Parts):** **Violated.** The question asks for two distinct outputs: the probability density function $q(z)$ and the conditional expectation $E[Z | Z \leq 1]$. Each request should be a separate question to adhere to the single output requirement.
*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** **Partial Violation.** While finding the PDF of $Z=\sqrt{X^2+Y^2}$ for $X,Y \sim U[0,1]$ is a fairly common transformation problem, the addition of the conditional expectation adds a layer of complexity that slightly elevates it from a purely standard textbook problem. However, the core elements are still very recognizable.

**Actionable Feedback for Question 1:**
*   Split this into two separate questions. One question should ask *only* for $q(z)$, and another *only* for $E[Z | Z \leq 1]$.

---

**Question 2 Critique:**

*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** **Violated.** This is a classic and very standard textbook problem on the expected hitting time for a symmetric random walk in the context of gambler's ruin. The specific numerical boundaries ($+10$ and $-5$) do not make the problem original.

**Actionable Feedback for Question 2:**
*   To improve originality, consider modifying the random walk characteristics (e.g., a non-symmetric walk, a non-integer step size, or boundaries that are functions of $n$) or asking for a more complex property (e.g., the probability of hitting $+10$ before $-5$ AND the expected time, but then that would violate guideline 10). Or, consider a random walk on a graph or a different state space.

---

**Question 3 Critique:**

*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target - No proofs/derivations):** **Violated.** The question explicitly asks to "Derive the likelihood ratio test statistic $\Lambda$". This is a direct violation of the guideline "Questions must not be proves or derivations."
*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** **Violated.** Deriving the Likelihood Ratio Test statistic for comparing multiple normal means with known variance is a fundamental and very standard derivation covered in virtually all mathematical statistics courses and textbooks.

**Actionable Feedback for Question 3:**
*   **Crucially, rephrase the question.** Instead of asking for a derivation, ask for a specific *value* of the statistic given specific data, or a *property* of a *given* statistic. For example, "Given the likelihood ratio test statistic for $H_0: \mu_1 = \dots = \mu_n$, calculate its value for specific data $X_1, \dots, X_n$." Or, ask for the form of the statistic without using the word "derive" and for a less standard scenario.
*   To improve originality, consider a non-standard distribution for which an LRT derivation is less common, or a more complex hypothesis structure.

---

**Question 4 Critique:**

*   **Guideline 4 (Single Output) & 10 (No Multiple Parts):** **Violated.** The question has two distinct parts: finding $c$ and computing $E[X]$. Each request should be a separate question.
*   **Guideline 11 (No hints):** **Violated.** The parenthetical remark "(you might need to leave the answer in terms of an infinite sum if a closed form solution is not easily obtainable)" provides a hint about the expected form of the answer.

**Actionable Feedback for Question 4:**
*   Split this into two separate questions. One question should ask *only* for $c$, and another *only* for $E[X]$.
*   Remove the hint: "you might need to leave the answer in terms of an infinite sum if a closed form solution is not easily obtainable."

---

**Question 5 Critique:**

*   **Guideline 4 (Single Output) & 10 (No Multiple Parts):** **Violated.** This question has multiple distinct parts: calculating bias for two estimators, MSE for two estimators, and then making a comparative judgment. This is a severe violation of the single output/no multiple parts rule.
*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** **Violated.** Comparing $2\bar{X}$ and a scaled maximum likelihood estimator for the upper bound of a uniform distribution using bias and MSE is a canonical example found in nearly every textbook on statistical inference.

**Actionable Feedback for Question 5:**
*   This question must be split into at least five separate questions to comply with the single output rule. For example:
    *   "Calculate the bias of $\hat{\theta}_1 = 2\bar{X}$ for $\theta$."
    *   "Calculate the bias of $\hat{\theta}_2 = \frac{n+1}{n}X_{(n)}$ for $\theta$."
    *   "Calculate the mean squared error (MSE) of $\hat{\theta}_1 = 2\bar{X}$ for $\theta$."
    *   "Calculate the mean squared error (MSE) of $\hat{\theta}_2 = \frac{n+1}{n}X_{(n)}$ for $\theta$."
    *   A separate question could then ask for a *specific numeric comparison* of the MSEs under a given scenario, or a specific value for the ratio of MSEs.
*   To improve originality, consider different distributions, more complex parameters, or non-standard estimators.

Okay, I understand the feedback. I will address the concerns regarding originality, the single output rule, the "no derivations" rule, and hints. Here are five revised probability questions, attempting to adhere to all the guidelines.

1. <question>Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent random variables, both uniformly distributed on the interval $[0, 1]$. Let $Z = \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2}$. Find the value of the probability density function of $Z$, denoted by $q(z)$, at $z=0.5$.</question>
