1.  <question>A Radon measure $\mu$ is defined on the Borel $\sigma$-algebra of the unit square $[0,1]^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. The projections onto the $x$ and $y$ axes are denoted by $\pi_x(x,y) = x$ and $\pi_y(x,y) = y$.  The marginal measures on $[0,1]$ are given by $\mu_x(A) = \mu(\pi_x^{-1}(A))$ and $\mu_y(B) = \mu(\pi_y^{-1}(B))$ for Borel sets $A, B \subset [0,1]$.  Assume that $\mu_x$ is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure $m$ on $[0,1]$, and $\mu_x(dx) = f(x) dx$ for some measurable function $f:[0,1] \to [0, \infty)$.  Similarly, assume $\mu_y(dy) = g(y) dy$ for some measurable function $g:[0,1] \to [0, \infty)$.

Let $h(x,y)$ be a bounded measurable function on $[0,1]^2$.  Calculate the expected value of $h(X,Y)$ with respect to $\mu$ under the assumption that $X$ and $Y$ are independent, given the Radon-Nikodym derivative $d\mu/d(m \otimes m) = k(x,y)$. Express the result in terms of $h$, $f$, $g$, and $k$.

Here's a critique of the provided questions against your guidelines:

---

**Question 1 Critique:**

*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** Fails. The question asks for an expression in terms of given functions, which constitutes a derivation rather than a calculation of a specific symbolic or numeric result. The guideline explicitly states: "Questions must not be proves or derivations."
*   **Guideline 8 (Solution Formatting):** Fails. The question uses `\\(...\\)` for inline math instead of `$...$` as specified for consistency with the expected output format.

*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   **Regarding Guideline 3:** This question type (deriving a formula) is explicitly disallowed. To fix, either rephrase to ask for a specific calculation if parameters were given (making it trivial if the formula is known), or omit the question if this type of derivation is not desired.
    *   **Regarding Guideline 8:** Replace `\\(...\\)` with `$...$` for all inline mathematical expressions within the question text.

---

**Question 2 Critique:**

*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Fails. This is a very common, standard textbook example of calculating conditional expectation for a simple measurable function.

*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   **Regarding Guideline 6:** Modify the random variables or the $\sigma$-algebra to introduce more complexity or a less immediately recognizable setup, making the problem less of a direct recall from a textbook. For example, use a non-trivial transformation for $Y(\omega)$ or a more complex definition of $\mathcal{G}$.
    *   **Regarding Guideline 8:** Replace `\\(...\\)` with `$...$` for all inline mathematical expressions within the question text.

---

**Question 3 Critique:**

*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Fails. This is a very common, standard textbook example of calculating conditional expectation with respect to a discrete $\sigma$-algebra.

*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   **Regarding Guideline 6:** Make the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{G}$ or the function $f(x)$ more complex or less standard to ensure the problem is unique and non-trivial.
    *   **Regarding Guideline 8:** Replace `\\(...\\)` with `$...$` for all inline mathematical expressions within the question text.

---

**Question 4 Critique:**

*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** Fails. The first part asks to "Show that...", which is a proof/derivation and explicitly disallowed.
*   **Guideline 4 (Single Output):** Fails. The question asks for two distinct things: a proof and a calculation.
*   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** Fails. The second part's calculation becomes trivial if the first part (the proof) is performed, making it redundant.
*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Fails. Both parts are fundamental, standard textbook results or problems.
*   **Guideline 10 (No Multiple Parts):** Fails. The question clearly has two distinct parts to answer.

*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   **Regarding Guidelines 3, 4, 5, 10:** Remove the proof part ("Show that..."). If the goal is to test the application of the property $E[X|\mathcal{G}] = E[X]$ for independent $X$ and $\mathcal{G}$, then either state this property as a given or integrate it into a larger, more complex calculation problem that requires its application but not its proof. Ensure the remaining question asks for a single, non-trivial calculation.
    *   **Regarding Guideline 6:** Avoid directly asking for the proof or trivial application of fundamental theorems.
    *   **Regarding Guideline 8:** Replace `\\(...\\)` with `$...$` for all inline mathematical expressions within the question text.

---

**Question 5 Critique:**

*   **Guideline 8 (Solution Formatting):** Fails. The question uses `\\(...\\)` for inline math instead of `$...$` as specified for consistency with the expected output format.

*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   **Regarding Guideline 8:** Replace `\\(...\\)` with `$...$` for all inline mathematical expressions within the question text.

### Question 1 Critique:

1.  **Input Format:** Adheres.
2.  **Mathematical Structure:** Adheres. The setup is well-defined and rigorous.
3.  **Solvable Target:** Partially adheres. It asks for clear symbolic results ($c$ and $E[h(X,Y)]$), but it asks for *two* distinct results.
4.  **Single Output:** **Violates.** The question explicitly asks for two separate values: "Find the value of the constant $c$" and "calculate $E[h(X,Y)]$".
5.  **Concise and Relevant:** Adheres. All information provided is essential for solving the problem.
6.  **Originality:** Adheres. While concepts are standard, combining finding a constant from marginals with an expectation under independence within a measure-theoretic framework is a reasonably unique and non-trivial combination.
7.  **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Adheres. It requires multiple steps for both parts (e.g., using total probability/marginal definitions for $c$, then using independence for the expectation).
8.  **Solution Formatting:** Adheres in its use of LaTeX for the question itself.
9.  **Language and Notation:** Adheres. The language is rigorous, concise, and uses standard mathematical notation.
10. **Questions must not have multiple parts:** **Violates.** This is the same as the violation for Guideline 4.
11. **Only questions:** Adheres.
12. **No numeric approximations:** Adheres.

**Feedback for Improvement (Question 1):**
*   **Split into two distinct questions.** To comply with Guideline 4 and 10, the question should be divided into two separate questions, one asking for $c$ and the other for $E[h(X,Y)]$.

### Question 2 Critique:

1.  **Input Format:** Adheres.
2.  **Mathematical Structure:** Adheres. The probability space, random variables, and $\sigma$-algebra are well-defined.
3.  **Solvable Target:** Adheres. It asks for a clear symbolic result ($E[Y|\mathcal{G}]$).
4.  **Single Output:** Adheres.
5.  **Concise and Relevant:** Adheres.
6.  **Originality:** **Violates.** This is a very standard and common textbook problem for conditional expectation where the sub-$\sigma$-algebra is generated by a function of the underlying variable. The specific functions chosen do not make it particularly unique or non-trivial compared to typical examples.
7.  **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Adheres. It requires understanding the structure of $\mathcal{G}$ and applying the definition of conditional expectation.
8.  **Solution Formatting:** Adheres in its use of LaTeX.
9.  **Language and Notation:** Adheres.
10. **Questions must not have multiple parts:** Adheres.
11. **Only questions:** Adheres.
12. **No numeric approximations:** Adheres.

**Feedback for Improvement (Question 2):**
*   **Increase originality.** To comply with Guideline 6, consider using a more complex $\sigma$-algebra (e.g., generated by two non-trivially related random variables, or a $\sigma$-algebra not directly from a function) or a random variable $Y$ that requires more sophisticated manipulation in terms of the $\mathcal{G}$-measurable functions.

### Question 3 Critique:

1.  **Input Format:** Adheres.
2.  **Mathematical Structure:** Adheres.
3.  **Solvable Target:** Adheres.
4.  **Single Output:** Adheres.
5.  **Concise and Relevant:** Adheres.
6.  **Originality:** **Violates.** This is a quintessential introductory textbook problem for conditional expectation with respect to a finite partition. It is a direct rephrasing of a very common example.
7.  **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Adheres. It requires calculating integrals over each partition element.
8.  **Solution Formatting:** Adheres in its use of LaTeX.
9.  **Language and Notation:** Adheres.
10. **Questions must not have multiple parts:** Adheres.
11. **Only questions:** Adheres.
12. **No numeric approximations:** Adheres.

**Feedback for Improvement (Question 3):**
*   **Increase originality.** To comply with Guideline 6, consider a more complex partition (e.g., infinite but countable partition, or one defined by a function) or a different underlying probability measure (not Lebesgue).

### Question 4 Critique:

1.  **Input Format:** Adheres.
2.  **Mathematical Structure:** Adheres.
3.  **Solvable Target:** Adheres.
4.  **Single Output:** Adheres.
5.  **Concise and Relevant:** Adheres.
6.  **Originality:** **Violates.** This is the most basic and arguably trivial example of conditional expectation – with respect to a $\sigma$-algebra generated by a single event. It is a direct rephrasing of a foundational concept often used to illustrate the definition, lacking any unique problem-solving aspect.
7.  **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Adheres, but the steps are minimal (two cases based on the event or its complement).
8.  **Solution Formatting:** Adheres in its use of LaTeX.
9.  **Language and Notation:** Adheres.
10. **Questions must not have multiple parts:** Adheres.
11. **Only questions:** Adheres.
12. **No numeric approximations:** Adheres.

**Feedback for Improvement (Question 4):**
*   **Increase originality and complexity.** To comply with Guideline 6 and 7, this problem needs to be significantly more complex. A $\sigma$-algebra generated by a single event is too simplistic. Consider a $\sigma$-algebra generated by a non-trivial random variable, or a sequence of events.

### Question 5 Critique:

1.  **Input Format:** Adheres.
2.  **Mathematical Structure:** Adheres. The discrete probability space, random variables, and $\sigma$-algebra are clearly defined.
3.  **Solvable Target:** Adheres. It asks for a clear symbolic result ($E[X|\mathcal{G}]$).
4.  **Single Output:** Adheres.
5.  **Concise and Relevant:** Adheres.
6.  **Originality:** Adheres. This problem is well-suited for conditional expectation on a discrete space, involving sums of random variables. It is not a direct textbook rephrase and requires a good understanding of the structure of $\mathcal{G}$ and properties of conditional expectation in this context, making it non-trivial.
7.  **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Adheres. It requires understanding how $\mathcal{G}$ partitions $\Omega$ and then applying linearity of expectation and properties of conditional expectation (e.g., $E[X|\mathcal{G}] = E[Y + (X-Y)|\mathcal{G}] = Y + E[X-Y|\mathcal{G}]$).
8.  **Solution Formatting:** Adheres in its use of LaTeX.
9.  **Language and Notation:** Adheres.
10. **Questions must not have multiple parts:** Adheres.
11. **Only questions:** Adheres.
12. **No numeric approximations:** Adheres.

**Feedback for Improvement (Question 5):**
*   This question generally adheres well to all guidelines and is a strong example of a well-posed problem. No major feedback for improvement.
