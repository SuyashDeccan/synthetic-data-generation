=== Turn 0: Critic feedback ===
Here is a concise critique for each question, mapped to your guidelines with specific suggestions for improvement:

---

### 1. Quantum Harmonic Oscillator, Time-Dependent Perturbation

**Feedback:**
- The question asks for "the first-order correction to the energy levels $E_n$ using time-dependent perturbation theory," but in standard time-dependent perturbation theory, energy corrections are not directly calculated (that's from time-independent perturbation theory), and resonant/dynamical transitions are usually the focus.
- "Closed form" is ambiguous given the time-dependent problem; without the initial state or explicit instructions, it may be ill-posed.
- The symbol $\omega$ is properly defined, and necessary information is present.

**Suggestions:**
- Clarify whether a transition rate, transition probability, or quasienergy correction (Floquet theory) is desired.
- Specify the assumption (e.g., initial state, long-time average).
- Check that the request is for a **single symbolic answer** and not a derivation.

---

### 2. Particle on a Ring with Magnetic Flux

**Feedback:**
- This is a standard textbook problem ("Aharonov-Bohm effect" context).
- The setup is precise and all variables are defined.
- "Derive" in the stem violates the guideline: it should ask "Find an explicit expression for...".

**Suggestions:**
- Reword: "Find an explicit expression for the energy eigenvalues $E_n(\Phi)$ as a function of ...".

---

### 3. $N$ Non-Interacting Spins in a Magnetic Field

**Feedback:**
- Clear and unambiguous symbolic answer requested.
- All symbols are defined and formulation is concise.
- Slightly standard, but acceptable due to the inclusion of partition function rather than starting from scratch.

**Suggestions:**
- Replace "find the expression" with "Express the mean magnetization $\langle M \rangle$ as ...".
- (Optional) Rephrase to increase originality. For instance, request a less standard observable or alter the context.

---

### 4. Damped Harmonic Oscillator, Quality Factor

**Feedback:**
- The question is clear, concise, and symbolic.
- Not strictly "find," but "express" aligns with guidelines.
- A well-posed, non-trivial step remains.

**Suggestions:**
- Consider specifying a less common variant for more originality.

---

### 5. Special Relativity: Inverse Momentum-Velocity Relation

**Feedback:**
- Clear, concise, and original (inverse functions are less standard).
- All terms defined, and a single symbolic target.

**Suggestions:**
- None: this meets all criteria well.

---

### 6. $\delta$-Function Quantum Well

**Feedback:**
- Standard quantum mechanics problem; less original.
- Structure is good, clear single symbolic target, all terms defined.

**Suggestions:**
- Increase originality by, for example, varying the shape or including more parameters (asymmetrical delta, etc.).

---

### 7. Doppler Effect for Moving Reflector

**Feedback:**
- Well-posed, clear symbolic target.
- May be considered somewhat standard at the undergraduate level, but double-Doppler is less so.

**Suggestions:**
- Clearly specify "perfect reflector" (e.g., "mirror"); otherwise, very good.

---

### 8. Relativistic Group Velocity

**Feedback:**
- Clear, concise, precise.
- The group velocity expression is not a standard problem, showing some originality.

**Suggestions:**
- None; this is well-structured.

---

### 9. EM Wave Equation: Dispersion and Group Velocity

**Feedback:**
- Two outputs: requests both an explicit dispersion relation **and** a group velocity computation.
- This violates the "single solution" guideline.

**Suggestions:**
- Limit to finding **either** the dispersion relation $\omega(\mathbf{k})$ **or** the group velocity (preferably the latter if originality is sought).
- Reword to "Express the group velocity $v_g$ for a plane wave solution..." or similar.

---

### 10. Relativistic Particle in a Box: Energy Difference

**Feedback:**
- Clear, non-trivial, all terms defined, unique target.
- Single symbolic output.

**Suggestions:**
- None; this meets criteria well.

---

## General Action Points

1. **Wording**: Replace "derive," "calculate," or "show" with "find," "express," or "give" to avoid derivational prompts.
2. **Single Target**: Avoid dual-output requests (see Q9).
3. **Originality**: Several questions (Q2, Q6) are common textbook exercises. Add unique twists or additional parameters/constraints to increase originality.
4. **Conciseness**: Ensure stems have no unnecessary background.
5. **Notation**: All variables are defined and LaTeX structure is mostly consistent; continue checking for consistency.
6. **Format**: Follow Markdown syntax and avoid diagrams/visuals as required.

- **Strengths**: 
  - Precise setup and mathematical structure.
  - Direct, single symbolic output is requested.
  - Multi-step reasoning required.
- **Areas for improvement**: 
  - Slightly verbose in stating the energy eigenvalues (could just state "levels indexed by $n=0,1,2,\ldots$ as given").
  - "Explicit expression" could invite ambiguous answers unless clarified (e.g., do not expect an evaluated integral—make clear that a time-dependent perturbation theory first-order result is wanted).
- **Action**: Consider tightening the wording for brevity and clarifying the expected format of the solution.

---

**2. Particle on Ring with Magnetic Flux**

- **Strengths**: 
  - Clear, real setup.
  - Symbolic closed-form expression required.
- **Areas for improvement**: 
  - This is a classic textbook problem and is not particularly original (Guideline 6).
- **Action**: Consider using a less standard configuration or include a twist that requires more than direct recall.

---

**3. Spin-1/2 System, Partition Function**

- **Strengths**: 
  - Clear, mathematical description.
  - Direct, single symbolic answer expected.
- **Areas for improvement**:

- **Strengths**: 
  - Contains all necessary, non-redundant info.
  - Single symbolic solution.
- **Areas for improvement**:

  - Symbol $Q$ is somewhat rare in precisely this context—ensure standard notation.
- **Action**: Present with slightly less common constraints or in a different parameter regime.

---

**5. Relativistic Momentum to Velocity**

- **Strengths**: 
  - Novel inversion of a standard relationship.

- **Strengths**: 
  - Well-defined, classic setup.
  - Expects explicit, symbolic closed-form answer.
- **Areas for improvement**: 
  - Very standard; originality guideline not met.

---

**7. Moving Mirror and Doppler Shift**

- **Strengths**: 
  - Real-world conceptual basis, clean mathematical expectation.
- **Areas for improvement**:

  - Requires multi-step algebra.
  - Concise, expects a single symbolic answer.
- **Areas for improvement**: 
  - None significant; this is a good fit to the guidelines.
- **Action**: Well-written as is.

---

**General Feedback Across Questions:**

- **Originality** (Guideline 6) is the primary issue—most are direct reproductions of common textbook problems. Even minor adjustments can greatly improve uniqueness.
- **Conciseness** (Guideline 5): Some intros/symbol redefinitions could be trimmed.
- Most other requirements are solidly met (No multi-part, explicit input, symbolic single answer, etc.).

---

**Summary of Actionable Points:**

- Replace or adjust standard textbook problems to make them less direct recall and more non-trivial—especially by introducing subtle extensions, constraints, or combined phenomena.
- Where possible, reduce formula redefinition, but retain clarity and self-containment.
- Specify what counts as an “explicit expression” if ambiguity is possible.
- Ensure even questions in classic settings require multi-step or less routine reasoning.

Here is a concise, question-by-question critique based on your assessment guidelines:

---

**Q1:** (Quantum harmonic oscillator under periodic perturbation)
- **Strengths:** Clear setup, well-defined target (explicit probability expression, selection rules), expects symbolic answer.
- **Issues:** 
    - Requires an explicit derivation rather than just a final symbolic formula; wording ("derive an explicit expression") invites a derivation.
    - "Selection rules" may be interpreted as a qualitative answer (not a single symbolic expression), violating single output rule.
    - The question is slightly overlong due to reiteration of notation.
- **Improvements:** Ask for "the explicit formula for $P_{n \to m}(t)$ according to first-order time-dependent perturbation theory, expressed in..." and specify "state any selection rules in symbolic form" (or better, encode as Kronecker delta in the answer).

---

**Q2:** (Ring with magnetic flux and weak potential)
- **Strengths:** Good physical setup; asks for symbolic energy eigenvalues and qualitative effect of perturbation.
- **Issues:** 
    - Two outputs: one for eigenvalues, one for qualitative level shifts and transitions—violates single output rule.
    - "Describe qualitatively" is ambiguous and not a symbolic answer.
- **Improvements:** Restrict to asking for the general formula for unperturbed $E_n(\Phi)$, or for the symbolic first-order correction to $E_n$; if asking about transitions, require an explicit selection rule in Kronecker-delta notation.

---

**Q3:** (Spin-1/2 particles in field; partition function)
- **Strengths:** Specific, expects explicit formula, proper physics context.
- **Issues:** 
    - Asks for both the general explicit formula and two limiting cases—violates single output rule.
    - Requests qualitative physical interpretation ("interpret the physical meaning...").
- **Improvements:** Only ask for the closed-form expression for $\langle M \rangle$ in terms of $N$, $B$, $\beta$ and constants.

---

**Q4:** (Damped harmonic oscillator; $Q$-factor)
- **Strengths:** Good physical context; asks for a formula and qualitative parameter regime discussion.
- **Issues:** 
    - Violates single output rule by requesting both an explicit formula and a discussion.
    - Discussion component is not a symbolic answer.
- **Improvements:** Only ask for the formula for $\omega_d$ in terms of $\omega_0$ and $Q$.

---

**Q5:** (Relativistic momentum-velocity and kinetic energy)
- **Strengths:** Well-posed, unique, expects symbolic answer.
- **Issues:** 
    - Asks for two things: $v$ as a function of $(p,m,c)$, and $K$ as a function of $(p,m,c)$—violates single output rule.
- **Improvements:** Restrict to only one symbolic expression (e.g., kinetic energy as a function of $(p, m, c)$).

---

**Q6:** (Delta function potential with perturbation)
- **Strengths:** Unique, multi-step.
- **Issues:** 
    - "Derive the transcendental equation..." and "discuss qualitatively..." — again, two outputs.
    - Discussion is qualitative.
- **Improvements:** Ask only for the transcendental equation relating $E_b$ to specified constants.

---

**Q7:** (Moving mirror and reflected frequency)
- **Strengths:** Interesting, unique.
- **Issues:** 
    - Asks for both an explicit expression and "analyze the nonrelativistic limit and interpret..." — two outputs, second is qualitative.

---

**Q8:** (Relativistic particle group velocity)
- **Strengths:** Multi-step, expects explicit symbolic answer.
- **Issues:** 
    - Requests "limiting forms" for two cases—violates single output rule.
- **Improvements:** Only ask for $v_g$ in terms of $(p, m, c)$.

---

**Q9:** (Electromagnetic wave equation and dispersion)
- **Strengths:** Good context, explicit symbolic targets.
- **Issues:** 
    - Explicitly asks for two parts ("(a)" and "(b)"), violating single output rule.
- **Improvements:** Only ask for the dispersion relation in vacuum, or only in a dielectric, not both.

---

**Q10:** (Relativistic square well energy level differences)
- **Strengths:** Good use of multi-step reasoning.
- **Issues:** 
    - Requests both an explicit formula and a discussion of two limits (nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic), so two outputs.
- **Improvements:** Only ask for the formula for $\Delta E_n$ in symbolic form.

**Overall Summary:**

- **Single Output:** Most questions violate the "single output" rule by requesting two or more results (e.g., formula plus qualitative/limiting form/selection rule).
- **Avoid Qualitative/Descriptive Parts:** Eliminate requests for qualitative descriptions, discussions, or interpretative explanations.
- **Conciseness:** Several prompts can be tightened by omitting repeated explanations or redefining standard notation already specified.
- **Focus on Symbolic Output:** Revise all prompts to require exactly one symbolic answer, expressed explicitly in LaTeX with standard notation.
- **No Multiple Parts:** Remove any multiple parts (e.g., (a)/(b)), sub-questions, or mixed format outputs.

**Actionable Steps:**
- Revise each question to explicitly ask for one, and only one, closed-form or symbolic answer.
- Replace any "describe", "discuss", "interpret", or "analyze" instructions with a request for an explicit formula, equation, or expression.
- For selection rules, require a symbolic (e.g., $\delta_{n,m\pm2}$) formulation if truly essential.
- Ensure questions are concise, contain only needed background, and only introduce symbols that will appear in the answer.
- Remove multi-part formatting and ensure the answer can be given as a single mathematical expression.
