=== Turn 0: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of each question against the provided guidelines, along with actionable feedback:

1.  **Question 1:**
    *   Critique: Violates guideline 6 (Originality). The application of the variational method to a one-dimensional anharmonic oscillator potential $V(x) = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 + \lambda x^4$ using a Gaussian trial wavefunction $A e^{-\alpha x^2}$ is a very standard and common problem found in most quantum mechanics textbooks and problem sets. It is not "unique and non-trivial" in the context of academic originality.
    *   Actionable Feedback: To improve originality, consider modifying the potential (e.g., a different power of $x$, a potential with a more complex shape, or a multi-well potential) or using a different, less common, trial wavefunction for the given potential, or apply the method to a higher-dimensional system.

2.  **Question 2:**
    *   Critique: Adheres well to all guidelines. The non-uniform charge density $\sigma(r) = \sigma_0 \cos^2(\phi)$ makes the problem non-trivial but solvable, and it asks for a single symbolic result.
    *   Actionable Feedback: No specific improvements needed based on the given guidelines.

3.  **Question 3:**
    *   Critique: Violates guideline 6 (Originality). Determining the time-dependent wavefunction for a particle on a circle (quantum rotor/particle on a ring) when given an initial wavefunction that is a superposition of energy eigenstates is a very common, almost archetypal, problem in introductory quantum mechanics.
    *   Actionable Feedback: To enhance originality, consider introducing a perturbation (e.g., a weak, time-dependent angular potential), a system with different boundary conditions, or a particle with internal degrees of freedom, leading to a less standard time evolution problem.

4.  **Question 4:**
    *   Critique: Violates guideline 6 (Originality). The Bose-Einstein condensation temperature for non-interacting bosons in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential is a standard problem and result derived in advanced statistical mechanics or condensed matter physics courses. While it requires multi-step reasoning, it is not "unique" as a problem.
    *   Actionable Feedback: To improve originality, consider a different trapping potential (if analytically tractable), a system in a different dimensionality (e.g., 2D or 1D), or ask for a related but less common quantity, such as the condensate fraction as a function of temperature below $T_c$.

5.  **Question 5:**
    *   Critique: Violates guideline 6 (Originality). Determining the trajectory of a relativistic charged particle in a uniform magnetic field is a very common and standard problem in relativistic electrodynamics or classical field theory.
    *   Actionable Feedback: To increase originality, consider adding a uniform electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field (crossed E and B fields), or a time-dependent magnetic field (if the resulting equations of motion remain analytically solvable), or explore a non-uniform but simple magnetic field configuration.

6.  **Question 6:**
    *   Critique: Violates guideline 6 (Originality). Calculating the time-dependent state of two spin-1/2 particles interacting via a Heisenberg-like spin-spin Hamiltonian ($H = J \mathbf{S}_1 \cdot \mathbf{S}_2$) from an initial product state is a fundamental and frequently encountered problem in quantum mechanics, often used to illustrate spin dynamics or entanglement.
    *   Actionable Feedback: To make it more unique, introduce an external magnetic field (Zeeman effect) that may or may not be aligned with the spin interaction, or consider a different type of spin coupling (e.g., anisotropic coupling), or a system with more than two particles (if keeping it analytically solvable).

7.  **Question 7:**
    *   Critique: Violates guideline 6 (Originality). Determining the induced surface charge density on a perfectly conducting sphere placed in a uniform electric field is a canonical problem in electrostatics, typically solved using Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates or the method of images. It is highly standard.
    *   Actionable Feedback: To improve originality, consider a conductor of a different shape (e.g., an infinitely long conducting cylinder in a uniform field), a dielectric sphere in a uniform field, or a conducting sphere in a non-uniform (but simple) electric field.

8.  **Question 8:**
    *   Critique: Violates guideline 6 (Originality). Determining the position of a particle subject to a forced harmonic oscillator potential ($F(x, t) = -kx + A\cos(\omega t)$) starting from rest is a very common and fundamental problem in classical mechanics and ordinary differential equations. It is a standard textbook example for driven oscillations.
    *   Actionable Feedback: To increase originality, introduce non-linear terms in the force, a damping term, or consider a system with multiple degrees of freedom (e.g., coupled oscillators), or a different, less common, time-dependent force function.

9.  **Question 9:**
    *   Critique: Violates guideline 4 (Single Output) and guideline 10 (Questions must not have multiple parts to answer). The question explicitly asks for *two* distinct symbolic results: "specific energy $E/mc^2$ *and* specific angular momentum $L/mc$".
    *   Actionable Feedback: Split this into two separate questions. For example, one question asking for the specific energy and another distinct question asking for the specific angular momentum.

10. **Question 10:**
    *   Critique: Violates guideline 4 (Single Output), guideline 10 (Questions must not have multiple parts to answer), and guideline 6 (Originality). The question asks for the electric field "both inside ($r < R$) and outside ($r > R$)", which necessitates a piecewise function as the answer, effectively requiring two separate expressions. This counts as multiple parts. Furthermore, this is a very standard and elementary problem in electrostatics, often among the first applications of Gauss's Law in cylindrical symmetry.
    *   Actionable Feedback: To comply with the "single output" rule, you could ask for the electric field at a *single specified point* (e.g., at $r = R/2$ or $r = 2R$), or ask for the electric potential difference between two points. To improve originality, consider a non-uniform volume charge density $\rho(r)$, a multi-layered cylindrical shell, or a time-dependent charge distribution.

Here's a critique of the provided questions against your guidelines:

**General Feedback:**
The questions generally adhere well to guidelines 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. The primary area for improvement across many questions is **Guideline 6 (Originality)** and, in one instance, **Guideline 2 (Mathematical Structure)**.

---

**Question 1: Variational Method**
*   **Meets:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** While not a direct copy, the variational method with a Gaussian trial function for a potential involving $x^2$ and $|x|^3$ is a very common and expected problem type. To improve originality, consider a more unusual potential form or a different trial wavefunction that makes the integrals or minimization more complex or introduces a novel conceptual twist.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Consider a potential that yields less straightforward integrals or requires a different approach for the trial wavefunction optimization, or a potential that is not a simple polynomial.

**Question 2: Electric Potential of Non-uniform Disk**
*   **Meets:** 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 2 (Mathematical Structure):** The surface charge density notation $\sigma(r) = \sigma_0 \cos^2(\phi)$ is confusing. A function $\sigma(r)$ implies dependence only on $r$, but $\phi$ is used. It should be $\sigma(\phi) = \sigma_0 \cos^2(\phi)$ or $\sigma(r, \phi) = \sigma_0 \cos^2(\phi)$. Assuming the latter, it implies the charge density is uniform radially but varies azimuthally.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Clarify the surface charge density notation. Change $\sigma(r)$ to $\sigma(\phi)$ or $\sigma(r, \phi)$ to accurately reflect the intended dependence.

**Question 3: Expectation Value of Angular Momentum**
*   **Meets:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
*   **Critique:** This question is well-designed. It requires understanding of angular momentum eigenstates, time evolution, and expectation values, culminating in a maximization problem. It is a good example of a multi-step, non-trivial problem.

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Determining the Bose-Einstein condensation temperature for non-interacting bosons in a 2D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential is a **standard textbook problem** in statistical mechanics. It is often used to illustrate how BEC can occur in 2D for a confining potential, despite not occurring for free particles in 2D.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To improve originality, consider a different potential (e.g., anisotropic 2D, or a potential with a different power law dependence) or explore a related concept that isn't a direct derivation of $T_c$.

**Question 5: Relativistic Particle in E and B Fields**
*   **Meets:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** The problem of a relativistic particle moving in uniform electric and magnetic fields (especially crossed or perpendicular fields) is a **classic and very common problem** in relativistic electromagnetism.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Introduce a more complex field configuration (e.g., non-uniform fields), or consider a scenario involving radiation reaction, or a problem in curved spacetime if appropriate for the assessment level.

**Question 6: Two Spin-1/2 Particles Interaction**
*   **Meets:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** This exact Hamiltonian and the type of problem (time evolution of spin states under $\mathbf{S}_1 \cdot \mathbf{S}_2$ interaction, possibly with a Zeeman term) is a **very common and standard problem** in quantum mechanics, particularly for spin systems.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Modify the interaction (e.g., including anisotropic terms), add a third spin, or consider a different initial state that leads to a more complex time evolution or requires more advanced techniques.

**Question 7: Induced Surface Charge Density**
*   **Meets:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Determining the induced surface charge density on a perfectly conducting cylinder placed in a uniform electric field is a **standard textbook problem** in electrostatics, typically solved using separation of variables in cylindrical coordinates or method of images.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Consider a cylinder with a non-uniform charge distribution, a different geometry (e.g., a prolate spheroid), or a conducting object in a non-uniform external field.

**Question 8: Damped Driven Harmonic Oscillator**
*   **Meets:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** This is the archetypal **standard problem** for a damped, driven harmonic oscillator in classical mechanics.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Introduce a non-linear damping term, a more complex driving force (e.g., non-sinusoidal), or consider a system with multiple degrees of freedom and coupling.

**Question 9: Specific Energy in Schwarzschild Orbit**
*   **Meets:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Calculating properties of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) at $r = 3R_s$ in the Schwarzschild metric is a **fundamental and standard calculation** in general relativity.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Consider a different type of orbit (e.g., radial infall, or a highly eccentric orbit requiring more complex analysis), or ask about a quantity for a different black hole type (e.g., Kerr metric, which is significantly more complex), or a different context like gravitational lensing.

**Question 10: Electric Field of Non-uniform Cylinder**
*   **Meets:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Finding the electric field inside an infinitely long cylinder with a radially dependent volume charge density like $\rho(r) = Cr$ is a **standard application of Gauss's law** in electrostatics.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Introduce an angular dependence to the charge density $\rho(r, \phi)$, or consider a different geometry, or a problem involving bound charges in a dielectric.

Describe the conditions under which a Bose-Einstein condensate will occur in this system, and provide an *approximate* expression for the Bose-Einstein condensation temperature $T_c$ as a function of $N$, $\omega_x$, and $\omega_y$.

If the particle starts from rest at $x=0$ at $t=0$, *estimate* the amplitude of the particle's oscillation in the long-time limit ($t \to \infty$). Assume the damping term is weak. You may assume the solution is approximately sinusoidal and justify your approximations.</question>
