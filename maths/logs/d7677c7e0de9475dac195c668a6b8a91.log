Here are some novel university-level physics questions, formatted as requested:

1.  <question>Consider a sparse signal $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ with sparsity level $k$, meaning it has at most $k$ non-zero entries. We aim to recover $x$ from noisy linear measurements $y = Ax + w$, where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is a subgaussian random matrix and $w \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is a noise vector with $\|w\|_2 \leq \epsilon$. Suppose we use a Bayesian approach with a prior that encourages sparsity. If the coherence of the matrix $A$ is defined as $\mu(A) = \max_{i \neq j} \frac{|a_i^T a_j|}{\|a_i\|_2 \|a_j\|_2}$ where $a_i$ are the columns of A, what is the expected $\ell_2$ recovery error, $E[\| \hat{x} - x \|_2]$, where $\hat{x}$ is the Bayesian estimator, expressed in terms of $m$, $n$, $k$, $\epsilon$, and $\mu(A)$?</question>

2.  <question>Let $A$ be a bounded linear operator from a Hilbert space $H_1$ to another Hilbert space $H_2$. Consider the inverse problem of solving $Ax=b$ for $x$, where $b$ is a given data vector in $H_2$. Suppose we use Tikhonov regularization to stabilize the solution, i.e., we solve $\min_x \|Ax-b\|_2^2 + \alpha \|x\|_2^2$, where $\alpha > 0$ is the regularization parameter. Let $x_\alpha$ be the solution to this regularized problem. Furthermore, suppose we have an approximation $A_\delta$ of $A$ such that $\|A-A_\delta\| \leq \delta$. Determine the error $\|x_\alpha - x^\dagger\|_2$, where $x^\dagger$ is the minimal norm solution to $Ax=b$, expressed as a function of $\|A\|$, $\|A_\delta\|$, $\delta$, $\alpha$, and $\|b\|_2$.</question>

3.  <question>Let $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be independent and identically distributed random variables in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with probability density $p(x)$. We want to estimate $p(x)$ using a kernel density estimator $\hat{p}(x) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n K_h(x - X_i)$, where $K_h(x) = \frac{1}{h^d} K(\frac{x}{h})$ and $K(x)$ is a kernel function. Assume $K(x)$ is a Gaussian kernel with unit variance, i.e., $K(x) = (2\pi)^{-d/2} e^{-\|x\|^2/2}$. Let $D(p || q) = \int p(x) \log(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}) dx$ denote the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two probability densities $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. What is the upper bound on the expected KL divergence $E[D(p || \hat{p})]$ in terms of $n$, $h$, $d$, and smoothness parameters of $p(x)$ (assume $p(x)$ is sufficiently smooth)?</question>

4.  <question>Consider a linear inverse problem where we want to recover an unknown signal $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ from measurements $y = Ax$, where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is a known measurement matrix. Assume $A$ has restricted isometry property (RIP) of order $k$ with RIP constant $\delta_k < \sqrt{2} - 1$. Suppose $x$ is approximately k-sparse, meaning it can be approximated by a k-sparse vector $x_k$ such that $\|x - x_k\|_1 \leq \epsilon$. We recover $\hat{x}$ by solving the $\ell_1$ minimization problem: $\hat{x} = \arg\min \|z\|_1$ subject to $Az = y$. Express the bound for $\|\hat{x} - x\|_2$ in terms of $\delta_k$, $k$, and $\epsilon$.</question>

5.  <question>Suppose we have a classification problem where we want to learn a classifier $h: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$ from a set of labeled examples $(x_i, y_i)_{i=1}^n$, where $x_i \in \mathcal{X}$ and $y_i \in \{0, 1\}$. Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a hypothesis class of classifiers with VC-dimension $d$. Let $\epsilon$ be the desired accuracy, and $\delta$ be the confidence level. Using a uniform convergence bound, determine the sample complexity, $n$, i.e., the number of samples required to ensure that with probability at least $1-\delta$, the empirical error $\hat{R}(h) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{I}\{h(x_i) \neq y_i\}$ is within $\epsilon$ of the true error $R(h) = E[\mathbb{I}\{h(x) \neq y\}]$ for all $h \in \mathcal{H}$. Express $n$ as a function of $d$, $\epsilon$, and $\delta$.</question>
