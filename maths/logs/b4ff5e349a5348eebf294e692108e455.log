1.  <question>
The Standard Model (SM) is extended by a scalar singlet $S$ which couples to the top quark through the Lagrangian term $\mathcal{L} \supset y_S S \bar{t} t$, where $y_S$ is the Yukawa coupling. Assuming that the scalar singlet $S$ can mix with the Higgs boson $h$, and considering the effective field theory (EFT) framework where the new physics scale $\Lambda$ is much larger than the electroweak scale $v$, determine the modification to the top quark Yukawa coupling ($y_t$) at next-to-leading order (NLO) in $\alpha_s$, given that the mixing angle between $h$ and $S$ is $\theta$, and the relevant Wilson coefficient is $C_t$, express your result in terms of $\theta, y_S, y_t, C_t$ and $N_c$ (number of colors).
</question>

2.  <question>
A dimension-6 operator in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) modifies the top quark pair production at the LHC.

Compute the contribution of this operator to the anomalous chromomagnetic dipole moment of the top quark, $\tilde{\mu}_t$, at leading order, expressing your answer in terms of the Wilson coefficient $C_{tG}$ and the vacuum expectation value $v$ of the Higgs field.

Consider a scenario where the top quark interacts with a new heavy scalar particle $\phi$ with mass $m_\phi$ through an effective interaction described by the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L} \supset \frac{g}{\Lambda^2}(\bar{t} t)(\partial_\mu H^\dagger \partial^\mu H)$, where $g$ is a dimensionless coupling, $\Lambda$ is the scale of new physics, $t$ is the top quark field, and $H$ is the Higgs doublet. Assuming that the top quark mass $m_t$ is generated via the Higgs mechanism ($m_t = y_t v/\sqrt{2}$, with $y_t$ being the top Yukawa coupling and $v$ the Higgs vacuum expectation value), calculate the leading order contribution of this interaction to the shift in the Higgs self-coupling $\lambda$, expressing your answer in terms of $g, \Lambda, v$ and $y_t$.

5.  <question>
Consider a top quark pair production event at the LHC, where one top quark decays leptonically ($t \to b \ell \nu$) and the other hadronically ($t \to b q \bar{q}'$).

### Question 1 Critique:

1.  **Input Format:** Adheres.
2.  **Mathematical Structure:** Well-defined setup.
3.  **Solvable Target:** Ambiguous. "NLO in $\alpha_s$" typically implies a loop calculation. The inclusion of "relevant Wilson coefficient $C_t$" implies an EFT contribution. It's unclear if $C_t$ *is* the NLO term, or if a separate NLO calculation involving $C_t$ is expected, or if $C_t$ refers to a separate tree-level EFT effect. This makes the target ill-defined without further specification of the operator $C_t$ is associated with and its role in the "NLO" modification.
4.  **Single Output:** Expects a single modification. Adheres.
5.  **Concise and Relevant:** Generally concise, but the ambiguity from point 3 makes some elements potentially confusing rather than perfectly relevant.
6.  **Originality:** The combination of scalar mixing and NLO EFT contribution is conceptually non-trivial, but the specific request is vague.
7.  **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Requires understanding of mixing and EFT.
8.  **Solution Formatting:** (Applies to output)
9.  **Language and Notation:** Rigorous and consistent.
10. **Single Part:** Asks for one modification. Adheres.

**Actionable Feedback for Improvement:**
Clarify the specific contribution expected for "NLO in $\alpha_s$" and the precise role and definition of the Wilson coefficient $C_t$. For instance, explicitly state the dimension-6 operator $C_t$ is associated with, or clarify if $C_t$ represents the entire NLO contribution.

1.  **Input Format:** Adheres.
2.  **Mathematical Structure:** Well-defined setup.
3.  **Solvable Target:** **Violates Guideline #3.** The prompt states: "Questions must not be proves or derivations." The question explicitly uses "derive an expression". Also, "provide the solution(s)" is ambiguous regarding Guideline #10 ("Only one single solution"). While a single expression for a quadratic solution is possible ($ \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$), phrasing should be precise to avoid implying listing two distinct solutions.
4.  **Single Output:** Potentially violates Guideline #10 depending on interpretation of "solution(s)". If it means explicitly listing two roots, it's two outputs. If it means the quadratic formula, it's one.
5.  **Concise and Relevant:** All information is essential and relevant. Adheres.
6.  **Originality:** This is an extremely common and standard problem in experimental particle physics (neutrino reconstruction in top decays at hadron colliders). It is not unique.
7.  **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Requires applying momentum-energy conservation, invariant mass relations, and solving a quadratic equation. Adheres.
8.  **Solution Formatting:** (Applies to output)

10. **Single Part:** See ambiguity in point 3/4 regarding "solution(s)".
11. **No explanations:** (Applies to output)
12. **No numeric approximations:** Adheres.

**Actionable Feedback for Improvement:**
1.  Replace "derive" with "Determine" or "Calculate" to comply with Guideline #3.
2.  Clarify "solution(s)" to ensure it refers to a single symbolic expression (e.g., "provide the general symbolic form for the solution(s)").
3.  To increase originality, consider adding a specific kinematic constraint or a more complex scenario (e.g., boosted tops, or asking for an observable derived from $p_{\nu_z}$ rather than $p_{\nu_z}$ itself).

Assuming that the scalar singlet $S$ can mix with the Higgs boson $h$, with a mixing angle $\theta$, and considering the presence of the dimension-6 operator $O_{t\phi} = (\bar{t} \gamma^\mu t) (H^\dagger i D_\mu H)$ with Wilson coefficient $C_{t\phi}$, determine the modification to the top quark Yukawa coupling ($y_t$) at leading order in $C_{t\phi}$, and incorporating the effect of the $h-S$ mixing.

### Question 2

**Overall Assessment:** This question has a **critical flaw** that makes it unsolvable as stated. The specified dimension-6 operator cannot contribute to the specified process at leading order. While the structure is good, this fundamental physics inconsistency renders it unanswerable.

**Specific Feedback:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Input Format):** Satisfied.
*   **Guideline 2 (Mathematical Structure):** **Needs Improvement.** The scenario is internally inconsistent. The operator $O_{tq}^{(8)} = (\bar{t} \gamma^\mu T^A t) (\bar{q} \gamma_\mu T^A q)$ is a four-fermion operator involving a top quark and a light quark ($q$). It does not contribute to $gg \to t\bar{t}$ at leading order (tree level). It would contribute to processes like $q\bar{q} \to t\bar{t}$.
*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** Not solvable due to the inconsistency.
*   **Guideline 4 (Single Output):** Would expect a single expression, but unachievable.
*   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** **Needs Improvement.** The operator chosen is irrelevant to the process specified.
*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** While the *idea* of a new operator contribution is good, the specific mismatch makes it flawed rather than original in a productive way.
*   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** The intended calculation would require multiple steps, but the starting point is flawed.
*   **Guideline 8 (Solution Formatting in Question):** Satisfied.
*   **Guideline 9 (Language and Notation):** Satisfied.
*   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Satisfied.
*   **Guideline 12 (No Numeric Approximations):** Satisfied.

**Improvements:**
*   **Critical Action:** Either **change the operator** to one that contributes to $gg \to t\bar{t}$ at leading order (e.g., an operator involving gluon field strengths), **OR** **change the initial state process** to one that the given operator can contribute to (e.g., $q\bar{q} \to t\bar{t}$). The latter is likely the simpler fix: "Consider only the contribution from quark-antiquark annihilation ($q\bar{q} \to t\bar{t}$)."

---

### Question 3

*   **Guideline 8 (Solution Formatting in Question):** Satisfied.
*   **Guideline 9 (Language and Notation):** Satisfied.
*   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Satisfied.
*   **Guideline 12 (No Numeric Approximations):** Satisfied.

**Improvements:** No improvements needed.

### Question 4

**Overall Assessment:** This is an **excellent** question. It's a standard type of calculation in particle physics, but applied to a specific new physics model with non-standard couplings, making it a good test of fundamental principles. It fully meets all guidelines.

**Specific Feedback:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Input Format):** Satisfied.
*   **Guideline 2 (Mathematical Structure):** Satisfied. The decay scenario is well-defined.
*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** Satisfied. Requests a clear symbolic result for the partial decay width.
*   **Guideline 4 (Single Output):** Satisfied. A single expression is expected.
*   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** Satisfied. All information provided is essential for the calculation.
*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Satisfied. While a 2-body decay width calculation is standard, the specific interaction with $P_L/P_R$ and complex couplings makes it a unique application.
*   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Satisfied. Requires deriving Feynman rules, calculating the matrix element, handling chirality projectors, and applying the phase space formula.
*   **Guideline 8 (Solution Formatting in Question):** Satisfied.
*   **Guideline 9 (Language and Notation):** Satisfied.
*   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Satisfied.

### Question 5

**Overall Assessment:** This is a **good** question. It tests a common and practical problem in experimental particle physics data analysis, requiring kinematic reconstruction. It largely meets the guidelines, but could be slightly more concise.

**Specific Feedback:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Input Format):** Satisfied.
*   **Guideline 2 (Mathematical Structure):** Satisfied. The kinematic scenario is well-defined.
*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** Satisfied. Requests a clear symbolic result for the neutrino's longitudinal momentum.
*   **Guideline 4 (Single Output):** Satisfied. A single expression (potentially with two roots) is expected.
*   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** **Minor Improvement Needed.** The information about the *other* top quark decaying hadronically ($t \to b q \bar{q}'$) is not relevant to the calculation of $p_{\nu_z}$ for the leptonically decaying top. It adds unnecessary context.
*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** This is a very standard problem in experimental high-energy physics. While it is non-trivial and requires multi-step reasoning, it is not "unique" in the sense of a novel theoretical setup. However, it fits the criteria for requiring mathematical methods.
*   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Satisfied. Requires setting up and solving kinematic equations using invariant mass constraints.
*   **Guideline 8 (Solution Formatting in Question):** Satisfied.
*   **Guideline 9 (Language and Notation):** Satisfied.
*   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Satisfied.
*   **Guideline 12 (No Numeric Approximations):** Satisfied.

**Improvements:**
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To improve conciseness (Guideline 5), remove the information about the hadronic decay of the other top quark. Rephrase the beginning to focus directly on the relevant leptonic decay. For example: "Consider a top quark decaying leptonically ($t \to b \ell \nu$)..." instead of starting with "Consider a top quark pair production event at the LHC, where one top quark decays leptonically... and the other hadronically...".
