Here are three novel university-level mathematics questions, following the guidelines provided:

1.  <question>Consider a discrete group $G$ acting on a compact Hausdorff space $X$. Suppose $G$ has Property FH (Kazhdan's Property T for actions on Hilbert spaces). Let $\mu$ be a $G$-invariant Borel probability measure on $X$. Define the von Neumann algebra $L^\infty(X, \mu) \rtimes G$ associated with this action. If $G$ is also amenable, calculate the unique trace $\tau$ on $L^\infty(X, \mu) \rtimes G$ in terms of integration over $X$ with respect to $\mu$. Express the trace in the form $\tau(f) = \int_X E(f) d\mu$, specifying the conditional expectation $E(f)$ for a general element $f$ in the algebra.</question>

2.  <question>Let $G$ be a finitely generated linear group. Assume $G$ satisfies the Tits Alternative; that is, $G$ either contains a non-abelian free group or is virtually solvable. Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ such that $H$ is amenable. Consider a representation $\rho: G \to GL_n(\mathbb{C})$. Determine the maximal dimension $d$ of a solvable subgroup $S$ of $G$ in terms of the dimension of the Zariski closure of $\rho(H)$. Provide a formula for $d$ involving the Lie algebra of the Zariski closure of $\rho(H)$.</question>

3.  <question>Suppose $G$ and $H$ are finitely generated groups, with $H$ being a subgroup of $G$. Let $G$ act on itself by left multiplication. Consider the orbit equivalence relation induced by the action of $H$ on $G$, denoted by $E_H^G$. Assume that $G$ is amenable. Determine the cardinality of the set of $E_H^G$-equivalence classes in terms of the index $[G:H]$, assuming that $[G:H]$ is finite. Express the cardinality as a function of $[G:H]$.</question>

Here's a critique of each question against the provided guidelines:

---

**Critique of Question 1:**

1.  **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target) & 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** The question asks to "calculate the unique trace" and "Express the trace in the form $\tau(f) = \int_X E(f) d\mu$, specifying $E(f)$". The unique trace on a von Neumann algebra crossed product $L^\infty(X, \mu) \rtimes G$ (when $G$ is amenable) is typically a standard definition: $\tau(\sum_g f_g U_g) = \int_X f_e d\mu$. Asking to "calculate" this, or "specify" $E(f)$, amounts to recalling or stating this fundamental definition rather than performing a multi-step calculation or deriving a new symbolic result. This falls into the category of "proofs or derivations" or stating a definition, which the guidelines prohibit.
2.  **Guideline 4 (Single Output):** The question asks for two distinct outputs: "the unique trace $\tau$" and "specifying the conditional expectation $E(f)$". While one defines the other, the phrasing explicitly requests both, violating the "single, unambiguous symbolic answer" rule.
3.  **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** The condition "$G$ has Property FH (Kazhdan's Property T for actions on Hilbert spaces)" is likely a distractor. While it's a significant property for groups and their actions, it does not typically change the *form* of the canonical trace on a crossed product von Neumann algebra. Amenability of $G$ is sufficient for the uniqueness of the trace, and its structure is standard. Including Property FH makes the question less concise without adding necessary complexity to the specific calculation requested.
4.  **Guideline 6 (Originality):** As noted, the requested trace is a standard definition in the theory of von Neumann algebra crossed products. The problem, therefore, lacks originality and does not constitute a "unique and non-trivial" challenge in terms of calculation.

**Actionable Feedback for Question 1:**
*   Rephrase the question to require a genuine, multi-step calculation yielding a non-obvious symbolic result, rather than asking for the form of a standard definition.
*   Reformulate to request only a single, unambiguous symbolic output (e.g., just the expression for $E(f)$ if that's the core of the problem).
*   Remove the condition "$G$ has Property FH" if it is not directly relevant to the specific calculation of the trace's form.

---

**Critique of Question 2:**

1.  **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** The request to determine $d$ "in terms of the dimension of the Zariski closure of $\rho(H)$" AND "involving the Lie algebra of the Zariski closure of $\rho(H)$" is redundant. For an algebraic group (which the Zariski closure of $\rho(H)$ is), the dimension of the group is precisely the dimension of its Lie algebra. This phrasing implies two distinct quantities when they are the same.

**Actionable Feedback for Question 2:**
*   Streamline the phrasing to avoid redundancy, for example, by asking for $d$ "in terms of the dimension of the Lie algebra of the Zariski closure of $\rho(H)$."

---

**Critique of Question 3:**

1.  **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** The conditions "finitely generated groups" and "Assume that $G$ is amenable" are entirely superfluous for the problem asked. The cardinality of the set of orbits of $H$ acting on $G$ by left multiplication (which corresponds to the set of right cosets $G/H$) is, by definition, the index $[G:H]$. Group generation or amenability have no bearing on this fundamental definition.
2.  **Guideline 6 (Originality) & 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** The question essentially asks for the definition of the index of a subgroup. The set of $E_H^G$-equivalence classes *is* the set of right cosets $G/H$, and its cardinality *is* $[G:H]$. This is a trivial problem that requires no multi-step reasoning, algebraic manipulation, or application of non-obvious theorems. It is a rephrasing of a basic definition from introductory group theory, directly violating the "Originality" and "Multi-Step Reasoning" guidelines.

**Actionable Feedback for Question 3:**
*   Remove all superfluous conditions ("finitely generated groups", "$G$ is amenable").
*   Completely revise the question to be genuinely non-trivial, requiring multi-step reasoning, and leading to a unique symbolic result beyond a direct definition.

Okay, I've revised the questions based on your feedback. Here are the improved versions:

1.  <question>Let $G$ be a discrete amenable group acting on a compact Hausdorff space $X$, and let $\mu$ be a $G$-invariant Borel probability measure on $X$. Consider the von Neumann algebra $L^\infty(X, \mu) \rtimes G$. Let $p: X \to [0,1]$ be a measurable function. Define a state $\phi_p$ on $L^\infty(X, \mu) \rtimes G$ by $\phi_p(\sum_{g \in G} f_g U_g) = \int_X p(x) f_e(x) d\mu(x)$, where the sum is a finite sum and $U_g$ are the implementing unitaries.  Determine conditions on the function $p$ such that $\phi_p$ defines a tracial state on $L^\infty(X, \mu) \rtimes G$. Express these conditions solely in terms of properties of $p$ and the action of $G$ on $X$.</question>

2.  <question>Let $G$ be a finitely generated linear group satisfying the Tits Alternative, and let $H$ be an amenable subgroup of $G$. Consider a faithful representation $\rho: G \to GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ such that the Zariski closure of $\rho(H)$ has unipotent radical $U$. Let $k$ denote the dimension of the maximal connected solvable subgroup of $G$. Express $k$ as a function of $n$ and $\dim(U)$.</question>

3.  <question>Let $G$ be a group and $H$ a subgroup. Suppose $H$ acts on $G$ by conjugation. Consider the orbit equivalence relation $E_H^G$ induced by this action. Define $C_G(H)$ as the centralizer of $H$ in $G$, and $N_G(H)$ as the normalizer of $H$ in $G$. Determine the cardinality of the set of $E_H^G$-equivalence classes (i.e., the number of conjugacy classes of elements of $G$ under conjugation by elements of $H$) if $H$ is finite and $G$ is the free group on two generators. Your answer should involve the cardinalities of $H$, $N_G(H)$, and $C_G(H)$, as well as potentially other relevant quantities associated with the free group.</question>
=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of the revised questions:

1.  **Question 1:**
    The phrase "Determine conditions on the function $p$" typically leads to a list or set of properties that $p$ must satisfy, which constitutes a derivation or a multi-part answer. This violates Guideline 3 (questions must not be proofs or derivations), Guideline 4 (expecting a single, unambiguous symbolic answer), and Guideline 10 (questions must not have multiple parts to answer). Rephrase the question to ask for a specific symbolic value or a single functional form for $p$ that satisfies the requirements, rather than a set of conditions.

2.  **Question 2:**
    This question aligns well with all guidelines. It presents a complex, well-defined setup and asks for a single symbolic result ($k$ as a function of $n$ and $\dim(U)$), demonstrating originality and requiring multi-step reasoning.

3.  **Question 3:**
    This question contains a fundamental flaw. For the free group on two generators, $G = F_2$, any finite subgroup $H$ must be trivial (i.e., $H = \{e\}$). If $H=\{e\}$, then the action by conjugation leaves every element fixed ($ex e^{-1} = x$), meaning each element forms its own conjugacy class. Consequently, the number of such classes is infinite (equal to the cardinality of $G$), making the question trivial. The request to involve cardinalities of $H$, $N_G(H)$, and $C_G(H)$ (which would be $1$, $|G|$, and $|G|$ respectively) becomes a red herring. This violates Guideline 6 (originality and non-triviality) and undermines Guideline 7 (multi-step reasoning). The problem needs a different group $G$ or a different type of subgroup $H$ to be non-trivial.
=== Turn 2: Author refines questions ===
Okay, here are the revised questions based on your feedback. I've addressed the identified issues in questions 1 and 3.

1.  <question>Let $G$ be a discrete amenable group acting on a compact Hausdorff space $X$, and let $\mu$ be a $G$-invariant Borel probability measure on $X$. Consider the von Neumann algebra $L^\infty(X, \mu) \rtimes G$. Find *a* function $p: X \to [0,1]$ that is measurable and such that the state $\phi_p$ on $L^\infty(X, \mu) \rtimes G$ defined by $\phi_p(\sum_{g \in G} f_g U_g) = \int_X p(x) f_e(x) d\mu(x)$ is a tracial state.  The function $p$ should be non-constant and explicitly depend on both $x \in X$ and the action of $G$ on $X$.  Provide a single, explicit functional form for $p(x)$. Assume $G$ acts freely on $X$.</question>

2.  <question>Let $G$ be a finitely generated linear group satisfying the Tits Alternative, and let $H$ be an amenable subgroup of $G$. Consider a faithful representation $\rho: G \to GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ such that the Zariski closure of $\rho(H)$ has unipotent radical $U$. Let $k$ denote the dimension of the maximal connected solvable subgroup of $G$. Express $k$ as a function of $n$ and $\dim(U)$.</question>

3.  <question>Let $G = SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ and let $H = \langle A \rangle$ be the cyclic subgroup generated by the matrix $A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$.  Consider the action of $H$ on $G$ by conjugation. Determine the number of conjugacy classes of elements in $G$ under the action of $H$ that consist of unipotent elements. Your answer should be a single integer.</question>
