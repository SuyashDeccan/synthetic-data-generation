Below is a question‐by‐question critique against your 12 guidelines, with concrete suggestions for tightening each prompt.

1. Question 1 (quantum oscillator ⟨V⟩)  
  • Guideline 5 (Concise & relevant): You ask for ⟨V⟩ in terms of m, ℏ, ω, n, but the standard result doesn’t depend on m—so m is superfluous.  
  • Guideline 6 (Originality): This is a one-line textbook exercise.  
  • Guideline 7 (Multi-step): There is virtually no algebraic chain, just “use H=ℏω(a†a+½) then extract ½mω²x².”  
  • Suggested fix: Drop m from the target variables and either (a) ask for both ⟨T⟩ and ⟨V⟩ to force a symmetry argument, or (b) embed it in a time‐dependent coherent‐state context to make it less routine.

2. Question 2 (rigid‐body kinetic energy)  
  • Guideline 6 (Originality): T=½ ωᵀI ω is immediate from definition.  
  • Guideline 7: No real derivation—direct matrix form.  
  • Suggested fix: Specify a nontrivial orientation (e.g. express T in body vs. space frame requiring Euler angles), so students must carry out the coordinate‐transformation algebra rather than quote the formula.

3. Question 3 (van der Waals specific volume)  
  • Guideline 4 (Single output): Solving for Vₘ yields a cubic with three branches—no unique elementary closed‐form.  
  • Guideline 7: Asking for the full Cardano result is tedious rather than instructive.  
  • Suggested fix: Instead of “determine Vₘ,” ask “show that Vₘ satisfies the cubic equation …” or “derive the cubic polynomial in Vₘ.” That gives a single neat symbolic answer (the polynomial) and avoids unwieldy roots.

4. Question 4 (helical loop distance D)  
  • Guideline 6 (Originality): Too standard—D=v∥·(2πm/qB).  
  • Guideline 3 (Solvable target): It is clear, but trivial.  
  • Suggested fix: Embed in a nonuniform B­-field or ask how D changes if B slowly varies (adiabatic invariant), so students must set up an integral rather than quote the gyration period.

5. Question 5 (infinite well with V₀ inside)  
  • Ambiguity: V(x)=V₀ inside but ∞ outside simply shifts all levels by V₀.  
  • Guideline 2 (Well-defined setup): Are you really asking for a finite well or an infinite one?  
  • Suggested fix: Either remove V₀ altogether (standard infinite well) or turn it into a finite square well of depth V₀, so that students must match decay vs. oscillatory solutions (nontrivial transcendental equations).

6. Question 6 (relativistic invariant mass)  
  • Guideline 6 (Originality): Direct application of M²c⁴=(E₁+E₂)²−(p₁+p₂)²c².  
  • Guideline 7: No multi-step besides plugging in γm.  
  • Suggested fix: Pose in a less trivial kinematic configuration—e.g. one particle at angle θ to the other—so they must do a vector addition of 4-momenta rather than a head-on collision.

7. Question 7 (magnetic torque)  
  • Guideline 6 (Originality): τ=μ×B is immediate.  
  • Guideline 7: No derivation needed beyond “definition of μ.”  
  • Suggested fix: Ask for the torque on a current loop in a nonuniform field, so they must expand B(r) to first order and evaluate ∫r′×J d³r′, producing τ=μ×B+(gradient term).

General remarks:  
 • Most prompts are textbook‐standard and yield one‐line answers—consider adding a twist (nonuniform fields, coordinate transforms, time dependence) to force genuine algebraic work.  
 • Beware hidden multi‐valued solutions (e.g. cubic equations). If you do want roots, either accept a polynomial as the final form or limit to asking for the characteristic equation.  
 • Remove any redundant symbols or parameters.  
 • Ensure each question demands a sequence of steps (setting up integrals, coordinate changes, matching boundary conditions) rather than recall of a formula.

Here is the revised set of questions incorporating the feedback provided:

1. <question>Consider a quantum harmonic oscillator with the Hamiltonian given by \( H = \frac{1}{2m} p^2 + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2 \). Use the concept of ladder operators \( a \) and \( a^\dagger \) to express the expectation values of both the potential energy, \(\langle V \rangle\), and kinetic energy, \(\langle T \rangle\), for the \( n \)-th excited state. Express your answers in terms of \(\hbar\), \(\omega\), and \( n \). Offer a qualitative explanation for why these values are equal due to the energy being equally partitioned on average between kinetic and potential components.</question>

2. <question>A rigid body is rotating in space with a constant angular velocity \( \boldsymbol{\omega} = (\omega_x, \omega_y, \omega_z) \). Derive the expression for its kinetic energy \( T \) in the body frame, where the principal moments of inertia \( I_1, I_2, I_3 \) are aligned with the body's coordinate axes. Extend this result by performing a transformation using Euler angles to express \( T \) in the lab frame. Assume all relevant tensors and angles are known.</question>

Determine the transcendental equation that quantizes the energy levels \( E_n \) of the particle, accounting for both oscillatory and exponential behavior near the boundaries. Express your answer in terms of \( V_0 \), \( a \), and other necessary constants.</question>

6. <question>In a relativistic scenario, two particles of masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) move towards each other with velocities \( \mathbf{v}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{v}_2 \), where \(\mathbf{v}_1\) forms an angle \( \theta \) with \(\mathbf{v}_2\). Compute the invariant mass \(\mathcal{M}\) of the two-particle system as observed in frame \( S \). Derive \(\mathcal{M}\) in terms of the particle masses, velocities, \(\theta\), and \( c \), the speed of light.</question>

7. <question>A current-carrying loop of arbitrary shape is placed in a nonuniform magnetic field \( \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}) \), where the field varies slightly in space. Given the magnetic moment of the loop \( \boldsymbol{\mu} \), derive the expression for the torque \( \boldsymbol{\tau} \) acting on the loop up to first-order expansion terms in \(\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r})\). Include both \(\boldsymbol{\mu} \times \mathbf{B}\) and any gradient-related terms in your final expression.</question>
=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Below is a point‐by‐point critique of each of the seven questions against your stated guidelines, together with concise, actionable suggestions for bringing them into compliance.

1. Quantum harmonic oscillator  
   • Violations:  
     – Asks for two distinct expectation values (⟨V⟩ and ⟨T⟩) plus a qualitative explanation → multiple outputs and a “why” argument.  
     – Requires both algebraic result and discussion.  
   • Fix:  
     – Choose one target. For example: “Express ⟨V⟩ for the nth state in terms of ℏ, ω, n.”  
     – Drop the qualitative part.  
     – Provide only the single symbolic expression in LaTeX.

2. Rigid‐body kinetic energy  
   • Violations:  
     – Two‐stage derivation (body‐frame then lab‐frame via Euler angles) → multiple outputs.  
     – Asks for a proof/derivation rather than a single closed‐form final expression.  
   • Fix:  
     – Decide whether you want the body‐frame result or the lab‐frame result, not both.  
     – Phrase it as “Show that in the lab frame the kinetic energy is $T=\dots$” and expect only that final formula.

3. Van der Waals cubic in Vm  
   • Largely compliant—asks for one polynomial.  
   • Minor polish:  
     – Explicitly state “Derive the cubic equation for $V_m$ in the form $a_3V_m^3+a_2V_m^2+a_1V_m+a_0=0$.”  
     – Remove “Explain any assumptions.” That asks for extra text.

4. Adiabatic helical pitch change  
   • Violations:  
     – Asks for “calculate,” “use the adiabatic invariant,” plus explanation → multi‐part and conceptual discussion.  
   • Fix:  
     – Reduce to a single symbolic target: “Using the adiabatic invariant $\mu=\frac{mv_\perp^2}{2B}$, derive an expression for the change ΔD of the parallel distance per turn when B changes from B₁ to B₂.”  
     – No further commentary or justification.

5. Finite well transcendental equation  
   • Compliant in spirit: one transcendental quantization condition.  
   • Tidy up:  
     – State exactly, “Derive the condition $$k\tan(ka)=\sqrt{\frac{2m(V_0-E)}{\hbar^2}}\,, $$” or its cotangent form.  
     – Remove any mention of “oscillatory and exponential behavior” as that is descriptive, not part of the answer.

6. Two‐particle invariant mass  
   • Compliant: single symbolic result.  
   • Polish:  
     – Ask “Show that $\mathcal{M}^2=(E_1+E_2)^2/c^4-|\mathbf{p}_1+\mathbf{p}_2|^2/c^2$ and express in terms of $m_{1,2},v_{1,2},\theta,c$.”  
     – Stick to that one formula.

7. Torque on nonuniform‐field loop  
   • Mostly compliant: one expression including both μ×B and gradient term.  
   • Tidy up:  
     – Phrase: “Derive up to first order in ∇B the torque $$\boldsymbol\tau=\boldsymbol\mu\times\mathbf B+\sum_i (\mu_j\nabla_iB_j)\,\hat e_i\,. $$”  
     – Expect just that single compact result.

General housekeeping for all questions:  
 • Use only text; no figures or external references.  
 • Wrap all final expressions in Markdown-style LaTeX: $…$ or $$…$$.  
 • Do not ask for proofs or multi‐step derivations—only the final closed‐form answer.  
 • Ensure each question requests exactly one symbolic output.  
 • Remove any request for explanations, qualitative discussion, or multiple parts.

Below is concise, actionable feedback on each question, organized by your 12 guideline points.  Where a question deviates, I’ve flagged the issue and suggested a remedy.

General remarks on all questions:
 •  Replace every `\(...\)` with `$…$` and every `\[...\]` with `$$…$$`.  
 •  Avoid “Show that…” or “Derive…” (which request a full proof); instead ask “What is…?” or “Find…?” to demand a single symbolic result.  
 •  They all resemble standard textbook exercises—consider introducing a small twist (e.g. anisotropy, coupling to an external field, non‐trivial boundary) to boost originality.

1. Question:  
  “Express the expectation value of the potential energy $\langle V\rangle$ for the $n$th excited state of a quantum harmonic oscillator in terms of $\hbar$, $\omega$, and $n$.”  
  •  Guideline 3/4 (Solvable target / Single output): Perfectly focused on a single symbolic expression.

     What is the expectation value of the potential energy $\langle V\rangle$ for the $n$th eigenstate of the one‐dimensional harmonic oscillator, in terms of $\hbar$, $\omega$, and $n$?  
  •  If you want more originality, you might ask for the expectation value in a shifted or squeezed oscillator.

5. Question:
