Here are some novel university-level physics questions, based on the specified topics, key concepts, and guidelines:

1.  <question>A massless string of length $L$ is attached to a point on a disk of radius $R$ ($R < L$) that rotates with constant angular velocity $\omega$ in the horizontal plane. The other end of the string is attached to a particle of mass $m$ which can slide without friction on the horizontal plane. Assuming the string remains taut and the initial distance of the particle from the center of the disk is $r_0$, determine the differential equation governing the radial distance $r(t)$ of the particle from the center of the disk, expressing the equation solely in terms of $r$, $\omega$, $L$, and physical constants.</question>

2.  <question>Consider a quantum particle of mass $m$ moving in one dimension under the influence of a potential $V(x) = -\alpha \delta(x)$, where $\delta(x)$ is the Dirac delta function and $\alpha > 0$. The Hamiltonian of the system is thus $H = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} - \alpha \delta(x)$. Determine the bound state energy $E$ of the particle.</question>

3.  <question>A point charge $q$ is placed at a distance $d$ from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius $R$ ($d > R$). Find the induced surface charge density $\sigma(\theta)$ on the surface of the sphere as a function of the angle $\theta$ between the line connecting the charge to the center of the sphere and the point on the sphere where the charge density is being evaluated.</question>

4.  <question>A relativistic particle with rest mass $m$ and charge $q$ moves in a uniform magnetic field $\mathbf{B} = B_0 \hat{z}$. If the particle's initial velocity is $\mathbf{v}(0) = v_0 \hat{x}$, determine the trajectory $\mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))$ of the particle in terms of $m$, $q$, $B_0$, $v_0$, and physical constants.</question>

5.  <question>Consider a one-dimensional chain of $N$ atoms with mass $m$ connected by springs with spring constant $k$. The atoms are constrained to move only in the longitudinal direction. Assuming periodic boundary conditions, determine the dispersion relation $\omega(q)$ for the allowed frequencies of vibration, where $q$ is the wavevector.</question>

6.  <question>A uniform rod of length $L$ and mass $M$ is initially at rest on a frictionless horizontal surface. An impulse $J$ is applied perpendicularly to the rod at a distance $d$ from its center. Determine the velocity of the center of mass $v_{cm}$ and the angular velocity $\omega$ of the rod immediately after the impulse is applied.</question>

7.  <question>A Carnot engine operates between two heat reservoirs at temperatures $T_H$ and $T_C$ ($T_H > T_C$). However, due to imperfections, the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir is $Q_H = (1 - \epsilon)Q_{H,ideal}$ and the heat rejected to the cold reservoir is $Q_C = (1 + \epsilon)Q_{C,ideal}$, where $Q_{H,ideal}$ and $Q_{C,ideal}$ are the heat absorbed and rejected in an ideal Carnot cycle, and $\epsilon$ is a small positive constant. Determine the efficiency $\eta$ of this imperfect Carnot engine in terms of $T_H$, $T_C$, and $\epsilon$.</question>

8.  <question>An electron is confined to a one-dimensional infinite potential well of width $L$. Calculate the expectation value of the position operator $\langle x \rangle$ for the electron in the $n$-th energy eigenstate.</question>

9.  <question>Consider a system of $N$ non-interacting spins, each with magnetic moment $\mu$, in an external magnetic field $B$. Each spin can be either aligned or anti-aligned with the field. Using the microcanonical ensemble, determine the entropy $S$ of the system as a function of the number of spins aligned with the field, $n$, the total number of spins $N$, and Boltzmann's constant $k_B$.</question>

10. <question>A light ray enters a medium with refractive index $n(y) = n_0(1 + ay)$, where $n_0$ and $a$ are constants and $y$ is the vertical coordinate. If the ray enters the medium at $y = 0$ with an angle of incidence $\theta_0$, determine the trajectory $y(x)$ of the light ray inside the medium.</question>
