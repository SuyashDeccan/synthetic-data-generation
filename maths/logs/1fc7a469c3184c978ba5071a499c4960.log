Here are some novel university-level mathematics questions, adhering to the specified guidelines:

1.  <question>
Consider a simplified model of a particle accelerator where identical particles are injected into a circular ring. The symmetry group of this ring is isomorphic to $C_n$, the cyclic group of order $n$, where $n$ represents the number of injection points equally spaced around the ring. Suppose we inject particles at each of these $n$ points simultaneously. These particles interact via a short-range repulsive force. Let $p$ be a prime number dividing $n$. Determine the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $C_n$ acting on the set of injection points under the group action by conjugation, given that these subgroups correspond to specific resonant frequencies in the accelerator.</question>

2.  <question>
Imagine a molecule consisting of $n$ identical atoms arranged in a regular $n$-gon. This molecule can undergo rotations by multiples of $2\pi/n$ and reflections about $n$ axes of symmetry. The symmetry group of the molecule is thus the dihedral group $D_n$ of order $2n$. Suppose $D_n$ acts on the set of atomic orbitals. If $p$ is a prime divisor of $n$ and also divides the order of the point group symmetry ($D_n$), find the number of subgroups of order $p$ in $D_n$ and express your answer in terms of $n$ and $p$.</question>

3.  <question>
Consider a crystal lattice structure with $n$ identical atoms. The automorphisms (symmetry operations) of this lattice form a finite group $G$ of order $n!$. A crucial feature of the crystal is its stability under perturbations. Suppose $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ representing the symmetry operations that preserve a particular defect in the lattice. If the index of $H$ in $G$ is $[G:H] = k$, and $H$ acts on the set of defect sites in the crystal. Determine the number of subgroups conjugate to $H$ in $G$, which directly influences the degeneracy of energy levels associated with the defect.</question>

4.  <question>
In a quantum system of $n$ identical bosons, the wavefunction must be symmetric under the exchange of any two particles. The symmetric group $S_n$ represents all possible permutations of these particles. Now, consider a specific energy level that is invariant under a subgroup $H$ of $S_n$. Given that $|H| = m$ and the total number of possible states is $n!$, determine the number of distinct energy levels arising from this symmetry restriction. Your answer should be expressed as the number of orbits of $H$ acting on the set of all possible states.</question>

5.  <question>
Consider a network of $n$ interconnected oscillators. The symmetry of the network is described by a subgroup $G$ of the symmetric group $S_n$. If a particular mode of oscillation is invariant under the action of a subgroup $H$ of $G$, and given the index $[G:H] = k$. Determine the number of distinct modes that are conjugate to the given mode under the action of $G$ by conjugation.</question>
=== Turn 0: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of the provided questions based on your guidelines:

### General Feedback:
Many questions suffer from a common issue: the "real-world" context is often thin, mathematically inaccurate, or completely irrelevant, serving only as flavor text. This violates the "Concise and Relevant" guideline. Several questions also risk being too trivial (violating "Originality" and "Multi-Step Reasoning") due to direct application of a single definition or theorem, or suffer from ambiguities in their mathematical setup, making them unclear or potentially unsolvable without further assumptions. Consistent LaTeX formatting for all mathematical expressions is also required.

---

### Question 1 Critique:

*   **Mathematical Triviality & Originality:** The number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of any cyclic group $C_n$ is always $1$. This is a direct consequence of the unique subgroup for each divisor theorem in cyclic groups. This makes the question very trivial, directly violating the "non-trivial" and "multi-step reasoning" guidelines for a university-level problem.
*   **Mathematical Incoherence/Misapplication:** "acting on the set of injection points under the group action by conjugation". Conjugation is an action of a group on itself or its subgroups, not on an arbitrary set of "injection points". If it meant $C_n$ acting on its own elements or subgroups by conjugation, the action would be trivial ($gxg^{-1}=x$) because $C_n$ is abelian, further reinforcing the triviality of the problem.
*   **Redundant Information:** The entire "particle accelerator," "identical particles," "short-range repulsive force," and "resonant frequencies" context is irrelevant flavor text and does not contribute to the mathematical problem.
*   **Formatting:** Variables like $n$, $C_n$, $p$ should be in LaTeX math mode (e.g., `$C_n$`).

**Actionable Feedback:**
*   Replace with a problem on Sylow subgroups for a non-abelian group or a more complex group structure, ensuring it requires non-trivial computation/reasoning.
*   Remove all irrelevant "particle accelerator" flavor text.
*   Correct the phrasing of the group action to be mathematically sound and relevant to the actual problem being posed.
*   Ensure all mathematical notation uses LaTeX (e.g., $C_n$, $n$, $p$).

---

### Question 2 Critique:

*   **Redundant Information:** "and also divides the order of the point group symmetry ($D_n$)" is redundant because if $p|n$, then $p$ necessarily divides $2n$ (the order of $D_n$). "Atomic orbitals" is also irrelevant flavor text.
*   **Ambiguity in Single Output:** The number of subgroups of order $p$ in $D_n$ depends significantly on the value of $p$. Specifically, for $p=2$, the answer depends on whether $n$ is odd or even ($n$ vs. $n+1$). For odd primes $p$, the answer is $1$ if $p|n$ and $0$ otherwise. This might require a case-based answer, potentially violating the "single, unambiguous symbolic answer" guideline if a single, unified expression is strictly expected without cases.
*   **Formatting:** Variables like $n$, $D_n$, $2n$, $p$, $2\pi/n$ should be in LaTeX math mode.

**Actionable Feedback:**
*   Remove redundant flavor text.
*   Clarify if a single expression (possibly piecewise) is acceptable or if the question should be restricted to a specific type of prime $p$ (e.g., "for an odd prime $p$ dividing $n$").
*   Ensure all mathematical notation uses LaTeX (e.g., $D_n$, $n$, $p$, $2\pi/n$).

---

### Question 3 Critique:

*   **Fundamental Mathematical Inaccuracy:** The statement "The automorphisms (symmetry operations) of this lattice form a finite group $G$ of order $n!$" is profoundly incorrect. The symmetry group of a crystal lattice (a space group) is infinite. Its point group is finite but its order is very small (e.g., 24, 48) and entirely unrelated to $n!$ for $n$ atoms. $S_n$ is the symmetric group on $n$ *labeled* items, not a typical lattice symmetry group. This completely undermines the problem's premise.
*   **Insufficient Information/Triviality:** The number of subgroups conjugate to $H$ in $G$ is $[G:N_G(H)]$, where $N_G(H)$ is the normalizer of $H$ in $G$. The question provides $[G:H] = k$. There is no general relation between $[G:H]$ and $[G:N_G(H)]$. Without more specific properties of $G$ or $H$, the question is either unsolvable in terms of $k$, or the expected answer is merely the definition itself, which would violate "multi-step reasoning".
*   **Redundant Information:** "Crucial feature...stability under perturbations", "degeneracy of energy levels" are irrelevant flavor text.
*   **Formatting:** Variables like $n$, $G$, $n!$, $H$, $k$, $[G:H]$ should be in LaTeX math mode.

**Actionable Feedback:**
*   Completely revise the mathematical setup to be accurate and coherent. For example, specify $G$ as a known finite group (e.g., $S_n$ if appropriate for a different context, or $D_n$, etc.), and then pose a problem about its subgroups.
*   If the goal is to ask about $[G:N_G(H)]$, provide sufficient information about $H$ and $G$ (or a relationship between $H$ and $N_G(H)$) to allow derivation of an answer in terms of the given variables. Alternatively, if the question is meant to be a direct definition recall, it needs to be made more complex to meet "multi-step reasoning".
*   Remove all irrelevant flavor text.
*   Ensure all mathematical notation uses LaTeX (e.g., $G$, $H$, $n$, $n!$, $[G:H]$, $k$).

---

### Question 4 Critique:

*   **Ambiguity of Group Action and Set:** "The total number of possible states is $n!$". This implies the set of states is isomorphic to $S_n$. "the number of orbits of $H$ acting on the set of all possible states." The type of action (e.g., left multiplication, right multiplication, conjugation) must be explicitly specified. Different actions lead to different orbit structures.
*   **Triviality:** If the "set of all possible states" is $S_n$ and the action is (typically) left multiplication, then the number of orbits of $H$ on $S_n$ is simply the index $[S_n:H] = n!/m$. This is a direct definition and might be too trivial for "novel university-level" and "multi-step reasoning" unless a more complex action or definition is implied.
*   **Redundant Information:** "Quantum system of $n$ identical bosons", "wavefunction must be symmetric", "energy level" are contextual flavor text.
*   **Formatting:** Variables like $n$, $S_n$, $H$, $m$, $n!$ should be in LaTeX math mode.

**Actionable Feedback:**
*   Precisely define the set on which $H$ acts and the nature of the group action (e.g., "by left multiplication").
*   To increase complexity, consider an action that leads to a non-trivial application of the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem or Burnside's Lemma, rather than a direct index calculation.
*   Remove all irrelevant flavor text.
*   Ensure all mathematical notation uses LaTeX (e.g., $S_n$, $H$, $n$, $m$, $n!$).

---

### Question 5 Critique:

*   **Ambiguity in "Conjugate Modes":** The most ambiguous part is "Determine the number of distinct modes that are conjugate to the given mode under the action of $G$ by conjugation."
    *   If a "mode" is an object $X$ and $H$ is its *stabilizer* $Stab_G(X)$, then the number of distinct modes (objects) in the orbit of $X$ is indeed $[G:H] = k$ by the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem. This interpretation makes the question very direct, potentially violating "multi-step reasoning."
    *   If "mode" refers to the subgroup $H$ itself, then the question asks for the number of conjugate subgroups of $H$, which is $[G:N_G(H)]$, not $k$. This would make the question similar to Q3, lacking sufficient information unless a specific relationship is given.
    *   The phrasing "by conjugation" usually refers to elements or subgroups.
*   **Triviality (if simplest interpretation):** If the answer is simply $k$ (based on the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem interpretation), the question is quite direct and might not require "multi-step reasoning" beyond recalling the theorem.
*   **Redundant Information:** "Network of $n$ interconnected oscillators" is flavor text.
*   **Formatting:** Variables like $n$, $G$, $S_n$, $H$, $k$, $[G:H]$ should be in LaTeX math mode.

**Actionable Feedback:**
*   Clarify what a "mode" represents mathematically and precisely define the group action on these "modes." If $H$ is the stabilizer of a mode, state it clearly.
*   To increase complexity, consider a scenario where the answer is not a direct application of the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem (e.g., requiring Burnside's Lemma, or multiple steps involving group structure).
*   Remove all irrelevant flavor text.
*   Ensure all mathematical notation uses LaTeX (e.g., $S_n$, $G$, $H$, $n$, $k$, $[G:H]$).

</question>
```
Key improvements and rationales:

*   **Removed Irrelevant Context:** All questions now focus solely on the mathematical group theory aspects, eliminating the extraneous particle physics and materials science framing.
*   **Increased Mathematical Accuracy:** Q3's original erroneous assertion about lattice symmetries has been completely removed. The groups and actions are now mathematically standard.
*   **Reduced Triviality:**
    *   The Sylow subgroup question has been made less trivial. While the number of Sylow subgroups *could* be 1, knowing that needs to be demonstrated.
    *   Q4 on subsets has been altered so that the number of orbits isn't instantly obvious without reasoning.  It requires recognizing that *all* subsets of size *k* are in the same orbit under the action of $S_n$.
    *   Q5 now requires computing the order of GL_2(Z_3) and counting the number of upper triangular matrices, then dividing.
*   **Addressed Ambiguities:**
    *   Precise definitions are now given for the groups and their actions.
*   **Formatting:** All mathematical symbols use LaTeX.
*   **More Appropriate Complexity:** The questions are more focused and require actual problem-solving steps rather than just recognizing a definition. For example, question 3 requires calculating a normalizer of a group, question 5 requires calculations within a finite group.
=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of each question based on your guidelines:

**Question 1:**
Let $G$ be the symmetric group $S_5$ acting on a set $X$ of size 5. Let $H$ be the subgroup of $G$ generated by the permutation $(1\ 2\ 3)$. Determine the number of distinct conjugates of $H$ in $G$ and explicitly describe the set of elements in one such conjugate subgroup.

*   **Critique:** Violates guideline 10 (single output). The question asks for two distinct results: a numerical count and a set description.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Split this into two separate questions. For example, one question could ask for the number of conjugates, and another could ask for the elements of a specific conjugate subgroup (perhaps defined by a specific conjugating element).

**Question 2:**
Consider the dihedral group $D_n$, where $n$ is a positive integer. Let $p$ be an odd prime dividing $n$. Determine the number of subgroups of order $p$ in $D_n$.

*   **Critique:** Violates guideline 7 (multi-step reasoning) and guideline 6 (non-triviality). For an odd prime $p$ dividing $n$, there is always exactly $1$ subgroup of order $p$ in $D_n$. This is because any such subgroup must be cyclic and generated by a power of the rotational element $r$, and the cyclic subgroup $\langle r \rangle$ contains only one subgroup of order $p$. This makes the answer trivially $1$, requiring minimal reasoning.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To increase complexity, consider asking for the number of subgroups of order $2$ in $D_n$ (which depends on $n$), or choose a different group where the number of subgroups of prime order is not trivially $1$.

**Question 3:**
Let $G$ be the group $A_4$, the alternating group on 4 elements. Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ of order 2. Determine the order of the normalizer $N_G(H)$ of $H$ in $G$.

*   **Critique:** This question is well-structured and meets all specified guidelines. It requires multi-step reasoning, including identifying the specific types of elements of order $2$ in $A_4$ and then computing their normalizers.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** No specific feedback; this question is suitable.

**Question 4:**
Let $S_n$ be the symmetric group on $n$ elements. Let $X$ be the set of all subsets of $\{1, 2, ..., n\}$ of size $k$, where $1 \le k \le n$. $S_n$ acts on $X$ by permuting the elements of the subsets. Determine the number of orbits in this action.

*   **Critique:** Violates guideline 7 (multi-step reasoning) and guideline 6 (non-triviality). The action of $S_n$ on the set of all $k$-subsets of $\{1, 2, ..., n\}$ is always transitive. This means there is exactly $1$ orbit, regardless of $n$ or $k$. This is a fundamental property taught early in group actions, making the answer trivially $1$.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To increase complexity, consider a different group action, such as $S_n$ acting on ordered $k$-tuples, or $S_n$ acting on pairs of disjoint $k$-subsets, or a subgroup of $S_n$ acting on $k$-subsets (e.g., $A_n$).

**Question 5:**
Let $G$ be the group $GL_2(\mathbb{Z}_3)$, the group of invertible $2 \times 2$ matrices with entries in the field $\mathbb{Z}_3$. Let $H$ be the subgroup consisting of all upper triangular matrices in $G$. Determine the number of left cosets of $H$ in $G$. Express your answer as an integer.

*   **Critique:** This question is well-structured and meets all specified guidelines. It requires multi-step reasoning by calculating the order of both $G$ and $H$ and then applying Lagrange's theorem.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** No specific feedback; this question is suitable.
=== Turn 2: Author refines questions ===

<question>
Let $G$ be the group $GL_2(\mathbb{Z}_3)$, the group of invertible $2 \times 2$ matrices with entries in the field $\mathbb{Z}_3$. Let $H$ be the subgroup consisting of all upper triangular matrices in $G$ with determinant 1. Determine the number of left cosets of $H$ in $G$. Express your answer as an integer.
</question>
```

Changes made:

*   **Question 1 (Conjugates of $C_3$ in $S_5$):**  Instead of asking for conjugates and a description of a conjugate subgroup (violating single output), this now asks for the *number* of subgroups isomorphic to $C_3$.  This requires recognizing that all 3-cycles generate such subgroups and accounting for overcounting (each subgroup has two generators) and conjugation.

*   **Question 2 (Subgroups of order 2 in $D_n$):** This now asks for the number of subgroups of order 2 in $D_n$ that *contain a reflection*.  This forces consideration of the rotations in $D_n$.  The answer is not simply 1 and requires understanding the structure of $D_n$. Also, the condition that $n$ is even helps to ensure there is more than one solution.

*   **Question 3 (Normalizer in $A_4$):**  This question was already good, but I've explicitly defined H to ensure no ambiguity.

*   **Question 4 (Action on Disjoint Subsets):**  The action is now on *ordered pairs* of disjoint subsets of the same size.  This significantly increases the complexity, as the action is *not* transitive. The condition $1 \le k \le n/2$ ensures we can form pairs of disjoint subsets with a given size k.

*   **Question 5 (Cosets in $GL_2(\mathbb{Z}_3)$):** $H$ is now restricted to upper triangular matrices with determinant 1, increasing the difficulty of calculating the order of $H$.
