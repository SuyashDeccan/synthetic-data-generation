Here are some novel university-level physics questions based on the specified topics, concepts, and guidelines:

1.  <question>A scalar field $\phi$ undergoes a cosmological phase transition in de Sitter space with Hubble constant $H$. The effective potential is given by $V(\phi) = \frac{\lambda}{4}(\phi^2 - v^2)^2$, where $\lambda$ and $v$ are constants. Calculate the radius $R$ of the critical bubble for a Coleman-De Luccia (CDL) instanton that mediates the transition from the false vacuum ($\phi = 0$) to the true vacuum ($\phi = v$) considering the Euclidean equation of motion in de Sitter space. Express $R$ in terms of $H$, $\lambda$, and $v$.</question>

2.  <question>Consider a de Sitter spacetime with metric $ds^2 = -dt^2 + a(t)^2 d\mathbf{x}^2$, where $a(t) = e^{Ht}$ is the scale factor and $H$ is the Hubble constant. Assume the existence of an oscillating instanton solution describing a tunneling event between two vacua with energies $V_1$ and $V_2$, where $V_2 < V_1$. Given the Euclidean action $S_E$ of the instanton, compute the tunneling rate $\Gamma$ per unit volume, considering quantum fluctuations around the instanton. Express $\Gamma$ as a function of $S_E$, $H$, $V_1$, and $V_2$.</question>

3.  <question>A black hole with mass $M$ resides in de Sitter space with Hubble constant $H$. The black hole undergoes a phase transition, characterized by a change in its Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Assuming the temperature of the black hole is given by $T = \frac{1}{4\pi (2M)}$, calculate the critical mass $M_c$ at which the phase transition occurs. Express $M_c$ in terms of $H$, given that the de Sitter temperature is $T_{dS} = \frac{H}{2\pi}$ and that the black hole and de Sitter horizons coincide at the transition point.</question>

4.  <question>During a cosmological phase transition in de Sitter space, a scalar field $\phi$ tunnels from a false vacuum state to a true vacuum state. The potential barrier separating the vacua is such that both Coleman-De Luccia (CDL) and Hawking-Moss (HM) instantons are possible. Determine the ratio of the CDL to HM transition rates, $\frac{\Gamma_{CDL}}{\Gamma_{HM}}$, given that the Euclidean action of the CDL instanton is $S_{CDL}$ and the potential difference between the top of the barrier and the false vacuum is $\Delta V$.</question>

5.  <question>Consider a cosmological phase transition with a potential $V(\phi)$ in a de Sitter background. Assume that the false vacuum has energy density $V_f$ and the true vacuum has energy density $V_t$. The Hubble parameter is given by $H = \sqrt{\frac{8\pi G}{3}V}$, where $G$ is Newton's gravitational constant and $V$ is the vacuum energy density. Compute the difference in the Hubble parameter, $\Delta H = H_f - H_t$, where $H_f$ and $H_t$ are the Hubble parameters associated with the false and true vacua, respectively. Express $\Delta H$ in terms of $G$, $V_f$, and $V_t$.</question>

Here's a critique of each question against the specified guidelines, with actionable feedback for improvement:

**General Feedback on Question Set Consistency:**
The difficulty and specialization level across the questions are inconsistent. Questions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are highly specialized, suitable for a graduate-level course in quantum field theory in curved spacetime or advanced cosmology. Question 5, however, is a much more basic application of the Friedmann equation and would be appropriate for an introductory undergraduate cosmology course. For a single assessment, it's crucial to ensure consistent difficulty and assumed prior knowledge.

---

**Question 1: Critique**
*   **Adherence:** Generally good. It adheres to input format, solvable target, single output, conciseness, multi-step reasoning, and formatting.
*   **Critique:** This is a very specific and advanced problem requiring knowledge of Coleman-De Luccia instantons in de Sitter space. While unique for a general university physics exam, it might be a standard calculation within a specialized graduate course. The prompt implicitly assumes the student knows the relevant formulas or how to set up the Euclidean equation of motion in this specific context to find $R$.
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** To ensure it remains a 'calculation' and not a 'derivation' (Guideline 3), consider providing any necessary simplifying approximations (e.g., "Assuming the thin-wall approximation...") if a full derivation of the instanton solution is not expected. This clarifies the scope of the calculation.

**Question 2: Critique**
*   **Adherence:** Largely good. It follows input format, solvable target, single output, formatting, and language.
*   **Critique:** This question focuses on tunneling rates and instanton prefactors in de Sitter space, a very advanced topic. The term "oscillating instanton solution" is somewhat unusual. Euclidean instantons are typically described as "bounce solutions" or simply "Euclidean instantons" that mediate tunneling. "Oscillating" usually refers to real-time solutions or behavior.
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant) & 9 (Language and Notation):** Replace "oscillating instanton solution" with more standard terminology like "Euclidean instanton solution" or "bounce solution" for clarity and consistency with common physics literature.

**Question 3: Critique**
*   **Adherence:** Mostly good regarding input format, solvable target, single output, conciseness, and formatting.
*   **Critique:** This question links black hole thermodynamics with de Sitter cosmology, specifically the extremal limit (Nariai solution) where horizons coincide. However, the provided black hole temperature $T = \frac{1}{4\pi (2M)}$ is strictly the Hawking temperature for a Schwarzschild black hole *in asymptotically flat space*. In de Sitter space, the black hole horizon and temperature are affected by the cosmological constant. The condition "black hole and de Sitter horizons coincide" is key, implying the need to use the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric and its horizon equations. The initial mention of "Bekenstein-Hawking entropy" is less central to the final calculation than the horizon coincidence condition and temperatures.
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   **Guideline 2 (Mathematical Structure):** Clarify the type of black hole, e.g., "Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole." Explicitly state the relevant horizon equation or condition for the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole, as the given simple temperature formula for a flat-space black hole is not directly applicable for an extremal black hole in de Sitter. The core of the problem lies in the horizon coincidence condition, which for a Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric means the black hole event horizon and cosmological horizon merge. The problem is solvable by finding the critical $M$ where $1 - \frac{2M}{r} - \frac{H^2 r^2}{3} = 0$ has a double root for $r$.

**Question 4: Critique**
*   **Adherence:** Excellent. This question adheres well to all guidelines. It's a clear, single-output calculation problem requiring multi-step reasoning by applying known formulas for CDL and HM instanton actions in de Sitter space.
*   **Critique:** No major critique. It is a well-posed, challenging question for a specialized course.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** None.

**Question 5: Critique**
*   **Adherence:** Good. Adheres to most guidelines.
*   **Critique:** This question is significantly simpler than the others. It's a direct application of the definition of the Hubble parameter from the Friedmann equation for a vacuum-dominated universe. While it requires two calculations and a subtraction (multi-step reasoning), the steps are elementary for university-level physics. It may not meet the "unique and non-trivial" criterion in the same way as the other questions, especially if they are intended for a graduate audience.
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** If this question is intended for the same high-level assessment as the others, it is too basic. Consider increasing its complexity, perhaps by asking for a more intricate relationship between the potential and the Hubble parameter, or by incorporating a more complex energy density contribution than just vacuum energy.

Here's the refined list of physics questions, incorporating the feedback provided. I've aimed for a more consistent level of difficulty across the questions, suitable for advanced undergraduate/graduate level and making the questions more clear in their intent.

1.  <question>A scalar field $\phi$ undergoes a cosmological phase transition in de Sitter space with Hubble constant $H$. The effective potential is given by $V(\phi) = \frac{\lambda}{4}(\phi^2 - v^2)^2$, where $\lambda$ and $v$ are constants. Assuming the thin-wall approximation, calculate the radius $R$ of the critical bubble for a Coleman-De Luccia (CDL) instanton that mediates the transition from the false vacuum ($\phi = 0$) to the true vacuum ($\phi = v$) considering the Euclidean equation of motion in de Sitter space. Express $R$ in terms of $H$, $\lambda$, and $v$.</question>

2.  <question>Consider a de Sitter spacetime with metric $ds^2 = -dt^2 + a(t)^2 d\mathbf{x}^2$, where $a(t) = e^{Ht}$ is the scale factor and $H$ is the Hubble constant. Assume the existence of a Euclidean instanton solution describing a tunneling event between two vacua with energies $V_1$ and $V_2$, where $V_2 < V_1$. Given the Euclidean action $S_E$ of the instanton, and assuming the prefactor for the tunneling rate is dominated by a single mode with frequency $\omega$, compute the tunneling rate $\Gamma$ per unit volume, considering quantum fluctuations around the instanton. Express $\Gamma$ as a function of $S_E$, $H$, $V_1$, $V_2$ and $\omega$. You may assume a form for the tunneling rate that incorporates the action and the prefactor related to $\omega$.</question>

3.  <question>A Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole with mass $M$ resides in de Sitter space with Hubble constant $H$. Determine the critical mass $M_c$ at which the black hole and cosmological horizons coincide. Express $M_c$ in terms of $H$. Hint: The horizons coincide when the equation $1 - \frac{2M}{r} - \frac{H^2 r^2}{3} = 0$ has a double root. </question>

4.  <question>During a cosmological phase transition in de Sitter space, a scalar field $\phi$ tunnels from a false vacuum state to a true vacuum state. The potential barrier separating the vacua is such that both Coleman-De Luccia (CDL) and Hawking-Moss (HM) instantons are possible. Determine the ratio of the CDL to HM transition rates, $\frac{\Gamma_{CDL}}{\Gamma_{HM}}$, given that the Euclidean action of the CDL instanton is $S_{CDL}$ and the potential difference between the top of the barrier and the false vacuum is $\Delta V$.</question>

5.  <question>Consider a scalar field $\phi$ with a potential $V(\phi)$ in a de Sitter background. Assume that the potential can be approximated as a sum of a constant vacuum energy $V_0$ and a quadratic term:  $V(\phi) = V_0 + \frac{1}{2}m^2 \phi^2$, where $m$ is the mass of the scalar field.  Suppose the field undergoes slow-roll inflation such that $\frac{m^2}{3H^2} \ll 1$.  Calculate the number of e-folds, $N$, of inflation that occur as the field rolls from an initial value $\phi_i$ to a final value $\phi_f$. Express $N$ in terms of $\phi_i$, $\phi_f$, $m$, and $H$. Hint: use the slow-roll approximation for the equation of motion of the scalar field and the definition of the number of e-folds.</question>
=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of each question based on the provided guidelines:

**Question 1:**
*   **Critique:** This question is well-posed and adheres to all guidelines. It is text-based, has a clear mathematical structure, asks for a single symbolic result, is concise, non-trivial, and requires multi-step reasoning. It avoids hints and relies on standard notation.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** No changes needed.

**Question 2:**
*   **Critique:** The question provides a hint: "You may assume a form for the tunneling rate that incorporates the action and the prefactor related to $\omega$." This violates Guideline 11 (No hints). Additionally, while $V_1$ and $V_2$ are given as context for the tunneling event, in many standard instanton calculations, their explicit values are subsumed into the Euclidean action $S_E$ and thus might not appear independently in the final tunneling rate formula, unless they are meant to influence a specific prefactor structure not commonly assumed. Clarifying this potential ambiguity would ensure a "single, unambiguous symbolic answer" (Guideline 4).
*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   Remove the sentence: "You may assume a form for the tunneling rate that incorporates the action and the prefactor related to $\omega$."
    *   Consider rephrasing the request for the parameters of $\Gamma$ if $V_1$ and $V_2$ are not expected to appear independently in the final formula, but rather are implicitly contained within $S_E$.

**Question 3:**
*   **Critique:** The question includes a direct hint: "Hint: The horizons coincide when the equation $1 - \frac{2M}{r} - \frac{H^2 r^2}{3} = 0$ has a double root." This violates Guideline 11 (No hints). The provision of the equation itself, while helpful, also slightly reduces the problem's challenge if the student is expected to derive it. However, the primary issue is the hint regarding the double root.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Remove the hint: "Hint: The horizons coincide when the equation $1 - \frac{2M}{r} - \frac{H^2 r^2}{3} = 0$ has a double root."

**Question 4:**
*   **Critique:** The question asks to express the ratio in terms of $S_{CDL}$ and $\Delta V$. However, the Hawking-Moss (HM) instanton action, which is essential for calculating $\Gamma_{HM}$ and thus the ratio, depends explicitly on the Hubble constant $H$ (as $S_{HM} = \frac{8\pi^2}{3H^4}\Delta V$). Since $H$ is a fundamental parameter of de Sitter space mentioned in the problem setup, it must be included in the list of parameters for the final expression (violates Guideline 5 for completeness regarding relevant symbols for the output).
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Modify the "Express..." clause to include $H$. For example, change "Express the ratio of the CDL to HM transition rates, $\frac{\Gamma_{CDL}}{\Gamma_{HM}}$, in terms of $S_{CDL}$ and $\Delta V$" to "Express the ratio of the CDL to HM transition rates, $\frac{\Gamma_{CDL}}{\Gamma_{HM}}$, in terms of $S_{CDL}$, $\Delta V$, and $H$."

**Question 5:**
*   **Critique:** The question contains a hint: "Hint: use the slow-roll approximation for the equation of motion of the scalar field and the definition of the number of e-folds." This violates Guideline 11 (No hints). The problem specifies "slow-roll inflation," which inherently implies the use of the slow-roll approximations, and the definition of e-folds is a fundamental concept for this calculation.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Remove the hint: "Hint: use the slow-roll approximation for the equation of motion of the scalar field and the definition of the number of e-folds."
