Express $l_{max}$ in terms of $m$, $k$, $l_0$, $v_0$, and $\alpha$.</question>

7.  <question>A photon of frequency $\nu$ scatters off a *bound* electron, initially in a harmonic oscillator potential with frequency $\omega_0$. The electron is initially in its ground state.

=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of each question against your guidelines, focusing on concise, actionable feedback:

**General Feedback:**
The questions are generally well-formatted using LaTeX and propose interesting physics problems. They adhere to the "no diagrams" and "single output" guidelines well. The main areas for improvement lie in precise wording to avoid ambiguity, ensuring analytical solvability within reasonable bounds, and truly achieving originality for commonly taught topics.

**1. A particle of mass $m$ moves in a one-dimensional potential $V(x) = \alpha |x|^\gamma e^{-|x|/b}$, where $\alpha > 0$, $\gamma > 0$, and $b > 0$. Using the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition, estimate the energy levels $E_n$ for large quantum numbers $n$. Express $E_n$ as a function of $n$, $\alpha$, $\gamma$, $b$, $m$, and the reduced Planck constant $\hbar$.**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality) & 12 (No numeric approximations):** The integral required for the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition, $\oint p dx = 2\int_0^{x_0} \sqrt{2m(E-V(x))} dx = 2\pi n\hbar$, with this potential $V(x)$, is generally not analytically solvable in a closed form for arbitrary $\gamma$. For "large quantum numbers $n$", one typically approximates the sum by an integral, but the integral itself for this potential is problematic for a general symbolic result. This might require numerical methods or highly specialized functions that are not typical for a "traditional mathematical methods" assessment.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To make this analytically solvable, either specify a particular value for $\gamma$ (e.g., $\gamma=1$ or $\gamma=2$) that simplifies the integral, or specify a limit (e.g., "for small $E_n$" or "for large $E_n$ relative to a characteristic energy scale") that allows for a tractable approximation of the potential (e.g., $e^{-|x|/b} \approx 1 - |x|/b$ or $e^{-|x|/b} \approx 1$).

**2. A relativistic rocket starts from rest and accelerates at a constant rate $a$ in its instantaneous rest frame. After reaching a speed $v$ relative to its initial rest frame, the rocket instantly reverses its acceleration direction, maintaining the same magnitude $a$. Calculate the total time elapsed in the *initial* rest frame from the start of the journey until the rocket returns to the *same spatial location* where it began. Express your answer in terms of $a$, $v$, and the speed of light $c$.**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** The role of "$v$" could be slightly ambiguous. "After reaching a speed $v$" implies $v$ is the maximum speed attained in the outward journey before deceleration starts. This is a common interpretation in such problems. If the intention is that $v$ is *some arbitrary speed reached*, and the reversal happens then, the problem might be ill-posed for a simple solution relating to the *total* time to return to the start. However, the most natural interpretation makes it well-posed.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** No explicit change is strictly necessary if the standard interpretation is intended. If you want to eliminate all possibility of ambiguity, you could clarify: "After reaching its maximum outward speed $v$ (at which point it reverses its acceleration direction)..."

**3. Consider a quantum particle of mass $m$ in a one-dimensional box of length $L$ with impenetrable walls. Now, introduce a potential $V(x) = \lambda \sin(\frac{\pi x}{L})$ within the box, where $\lambda$ is a constant. Determine the energy shift of the ground state energy $E_0$ of the system due to the introduced potential, accurate to second order in $\lambda$. Express $E_0$ as a function of $m$, $L$, $\lambda$, and the reduced Planck constant $\hbar$.**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target) & 4 (Single Output) & 10 (No multiple parts):** The question asks to "Determine the energy shift of the ground state energy $E_0$..." and then "Express $E_0$ as a function of...". This is ambiguous. Does "Express $E_0$" refer to the *unperturbed* ground state energy $E_0^{(0)}$ or the *perturbed* ground state energy $E_0' = E_0^{(0)} + \Delta E_0$? If it's asking for the shift, the output should be $\Delta E_0$. If it's asking for the total perturbed energy, it should be phrased as such.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Rephrase to be unambiguous. For example:
    *   "Determine the *total energy shift* $\Delta E_0$ of the ground state due to the introduced potential, accurate to second order in $\lambda$. Express $\Delta E_0$ as a function of $m$, $L$, $\lambda$, and the reduced Planck constant $\hbar$." OR
    *   "Determine the *perturbed ground state energy* $E'_0$ of the system due to the introduced potential, accurate to second order in $\lambda$. Express $E'_0$ as a function of $m$, $L$, $\lambda$, and the reduced Planck constant $\hbar$." (This is usually preferred if $E_0^{(0)}$ is simple).

---

**4. A thin disk of radius $R$ has a non-uniform surface charge density $\sigma(r) = \sigma_0 (r/R)^2$, where $\sigma_0$ is a constant. The disk is rotating about its axis with angular velocity $\omega$. Calculate the magnetic dipole moment $\mu$ of the rotating disk. Express $\mu$ in terms of $\sigma_0$, $R$, $\omega$, and fundamental constants.**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant) & 9 (Language and Notation):** The phrase "and fundamental constants" is vague. The expected answer will likely include $\pi$ (from integration over a disk), but $\pi$ is not usually what's meant by "fundamental constants" in physics (like $c, \epsilon_0, \mu_0, \hbar, G$). If $\pi$ is the only 'non-specified' constant, explicitly mention it, or remove the phrase if it truly doesn't involve any other commonly understood fundamental constants (which is the case here; $\mu_0$ is not required for the magnetic moment itself).
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Change to: "Express $\mu$ in terms of $\sigma_0$, $R$, $\omega$, and numerical constants like $\pi$." Or simply remove "and fundamental constants" if only the listed variables and pure numbers/$\pi$ are expected.

---

**5. A classical gas of $N$ identical particles is confined to a volume $V$ at temperature $T$. The single-particle energy levels are given by $\epsilon_n = A n^3$ for $n = 1, 2, 3,...$, where $A$ is a constant. Calculate the leading order temperature dependence of the heat capacity $C_V$ of the gas in the high-temperature limit, where $k_B T \gg A$. Express $C_V$ in terms of $N$, $T$, $A$, and the Boltzmann constant $k_B$.**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target) & 4 (Single Output) & 10 (No multiple parts):** "Calculate the leading order temperature dependence of the heat capacity $C_V$" combined with "Express $C_V$ in terms of $N$, $T$, $A$, and the Boltzmann constant $k_B$" is slightly ambiguous. "Temperature dependence" might imply only the functional form of $T$ (e.g., $T^{1/3}$), whereas "Express $C_V$" implies the full expression, including coefficients. For high-temperature limits where the leading term is a constant (i.e., $T^0$), it might feel contradictory. However, a constant *is* a leading order term, and $T$ simply won't appear if the dependence is trivial.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** The question is acceptable as is, but for absolute clarity, one could phrase it as: "Calculate the heat capacity $C_V$ of the gas, accurate to leading order in the high-temperature limit. Express $C_V$..." This clearly implies finding the dominant term for $C_V$ as $T \to \infty$.

**6. Two identical masses, $m_1 = m_2 = m$, are connected by a non-linear spring with a force law $F = -k(l - l_0) - \alpha (l - l_0)^3$, where $k$ is a constant, $l_0$ is the natural length, $l$ is the separation, and $\alpha$ is a small constant. The system is placed on a frictionless horizontal surface. Mass $m_1$ is initially held at rest, while mass $m_2$ is given an initial velocity $v_0$ directly away from $m_1$. Determine the *approximate* maximum separation $l_{max}$ between the two masses during the subsequent motion, keeping terms up to first order in $\alpha$. Express $l_{max}$ in terms of $m$, $k$, $l_0$, $v_0$, and $\alpha$.**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 2 (Mathematical Structure) & 9 (Language and Notation):** The initial separation is not explicitly stated. It is usually assumed to be the natural length $l_0$ if the system starts at rest, but this should be specified for clarity. Also, "Mass $m_1$ is initially held at rest" can imply it's fixed, but the problem context suggests it's a two-body system that will move. Assuming "held at rest" means its initial velocity is zero.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Clarify the initial separation: "Initially, the separation between the masses is $l_0$, mass $m_1$ is at rest, and mass $m_2$ is given an initial velocity $v_0$ directly away from $m_1$."

**7. A photon of frequency $\nu$ scatters off a *bound* electron, initially in a harmonic oscillator potential with frequency $\omega_0$. The electron is initially in its ground state. If the scattered photon is detected at an angle $\theta$ with respect to the incident direction, determine the probability that the electron is excited to the *first excited state* of the harmonic oscillator *immediately* after the scattering event. You may assume the initial momentum of the electron is negligible. Express the probability in terms of $\nu$, $\theta$, the electron rest mass $m_e$, the speed of light $c$, and $\omega_0$.**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality) & 12 (No numeric approximations):** This problem is extremely challenging and likely beyond the scope of "traditional mathematical methods" for a standard assessment. It requires advanced quantum electrodynamics (QED) or very sophisticated time-dependent perturbation theory/scattering theory for a bound system, which is typically taught at a graduate level. Calculating this probability (which would likely be a differential cross-section) symbolically in a closed form without significant, unstated approximations is analytically intractable for most students.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** This question needs to be significantly simplified or removed. To make it solvable within standard quantum mechanics, you would need to drastically simplify the scattering process, e.g., by treating it as a sudden approximation (where momentum is transferred instantaneously, and then the probability of finding the electron in an excited state of the HO is calculated) or by providing a highly simplified model for the interaction. As stated, it's too complex.

**8. A resistor $R$, inductor $L$, and capacitor $C$ are connected in series to a non-ideal AC voltage source modeled as $V(t) = V_0 \cos(\omega t) + R_s I(t)$, where $V_0$ is the amplitude, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $R_s$ is the internal resistance of the source, and $I(t)$ is the instantaneous current in the circuit. Determine the average power $\langle P \rangle$ dissipated in the resistor $R$ over one period of the AC cycle. Express $\langle P \rangle$ in terms of $V_0$, $\omega$, $R$, $L$, $C$, and $R_s$.**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 2 (Mathematical Structure) & 9 (Language and Notation):** The model for the non-ideal AC voltage source, $V(t) = V_0 \cos(\omega t) + R_s I(t)$, is phrased confusingly. It reads like the voltage *across the source terminals* is dependent on the current *in a way that implies a positive feedback or strange definition*. The standard model for a non-ideal source is an ideal voltage source ($V_{ideal}(t) = V_0 \cos(\omega t)$) in series with its internal resistance ($R_s$). Applying Kirchhoff's loop rule to this standard model would lead to $V_0 \cos(\omega t) = I(t)R_{total} + L\frac{dI}{dt} + \frac{1}{C}\int I dt$, where $R_{total} = R+R_s$. The current wording makes the circuit equation $V_{terminal}(t) = V_0 \cos(\omega t) + R_s I(t)$, which then equals $I(t)R + L\frac{dI}{dt} + \frac{1}{C}\int I dt$. This leads to $V_0 \cos(\omega t) = I(t)(R-R_s) + \dots$, which is unusual.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Clarify the source model to reflect the standard physical understanding: "A non-ideal AC voltage source, consisting of an ideal AC voltage source $V_{ideal}(t) = V_0 \cos(\omega t)$ in series with its internal resistance $R_s$, is connected to an RLC circuit." This makes the KVL equation clear: $V_0 \cos(\omega t) = I(t)(R+R_s) + L\frac{dI}{dt} + \frac{1}{C}\int I dt$.

**9. A particle of mass $m$ is confined to move on the surface of a sphere of radius $R$. Determine the energy eigenvalues $E_l$ of the particle using the quantization of angular momentum. Express $E_l$ in terms of $m$, $R$, $l$ (the angular momentum quantum number), and the reduced Planck constant $\hbar$.**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** This is a very standard textbook problem in quantum mechanics (the "rigid rotor" or "particle on a sphere"). It does not introduce any unique twist or alternative goal that would set it apart from a typical end-of-chapter exercise.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Introduce a novel element. For example, add a small perturbative potential $V(\theta)$ on the sphere, or consider two particles, or change the geometry slightly (e.g., a spheroid).

**10. Consider a black hole of mass $M$ *accreting* matter at a rate $\dot{m}$. According to Hawking radiation, the black hole emits thermal radiation with a temperature $T$ inversely proportional to its mass: $T = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8\pi G M k_B}$. Calculate the equilibrium mass $M_{eq}$ of the black hole at which the rate of mass gain due to accretion balances the rate of mass loss due to Hawking radiation, assuming it radiates like a black body with a radius equal to its Schwarzschild radius, $R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}$. Express $M_{eq}$ in terms of $\dot{m}$, $\hbar$, $c$, and $G$.**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant) & 9 (Language and Notation):** The Stefan-Boltzmann constant $\sigma$ is needed for blackbody radiation, $P = \sigma A T^4$. Its formula is $\sigma = \frac{\pi^2 k_B^4}{60 \hbar^3 c^2}$. The final answer for $M_{eq}$ involves $\pi$. The instruction "Express $M_{eq}$ in terms of $\dot{m}$, $\hbar$, $c$, and $G$" does not explicitly list $\pi$. While $\pi$ is a fundamental mathematical constant, its appearance via $\sigma$ might confuse students if not explicitly mentioned as an allowable factor. Also, $k_B$ appears in the temperature formula but must cancel out for the final expression to match the requested variables.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Explicitly state the use of the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and clarify that numerical constants like $\pi$ are allowed in the final expression: "Express $M_{eq}$ in terms of $\dot{m}$, $\hbar$, $c$, $G$, and numerical constants (e.g., $\pi$)." This makes the expectations clear regarding all components of the symbolic answer.

Calculate the equilibrium mass $M_{eq}$ of the black hole at which the rate of mass gain due to accretion balances the rate of mass loss due to Hawking radiation, assuming it radiates like a black body with a radius equal to its Schwarzschild radius, $R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}$. You may use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody radiation. Express $M_{eq}$ in terms of $\dot{m}$, $\hbar$, $c$, $G$, and numerical constants (e.g., $\pi$).</question>
