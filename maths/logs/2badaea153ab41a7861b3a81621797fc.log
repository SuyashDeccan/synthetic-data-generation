1.  <question>An event-based camera is mounted on a robotic arm moving along a trajectory defined by $\vec{r}(t) = (A\cos(\omega t), B\sin(\omega t), Ct)$, where $A$, $B$, $C$, and $\omega$ are constants. The camera detects events based on the logarithmic intensity change, $L = \ln(I)$, where $I$ is the intensity. If the threshold for event detection is given by $|dL/dt| > \theta$, where $\theta$ is a constant threshold, determine the maximum value of $|dL/dt|$ in terms of $A, B, C, \omega$, assuming that the intensity $I$ is proportional to the inverse square of the distance from a stationary light source at the origin, i.e., $I = k/|\vec{r}(t)|^2$, where $k$ is a constant.</question>

2.  <question>A POWERLINK-controlled robot is tracking a target moving erratically in 3D space. The target's position is given by the vector $\vec{p}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))$, where $x(t) = a\sin(bt)$, $y(t) = c\cos(dt)$, and $z(t) = et$, with $a, b, c, d, e$ being known constants. The robot's control system uses a Kalman filter to estimate the target's velocity, $\vec{v}(t) = (\dot{x}(t), \dot{y}(t), \dot{z}(t))$. Assuming the process noise covariance matrix $Q$ is given by a diagonal matrix with elements $q_x, q_y, q_z$ and the measurement noise covariance matrix $R$ is also a diagonal matrix with elements $r_x, r_y, r_z$, determine the steady-state Kalman gain matrix $K_\infty$ for estimating the target's x-velocity component $\dot{x}(t)$, assuming a simplified linear model where the state is just $\dot{x}(t)$ and the measurement is a direct observation of $\dot{x}(t)$.</question>

3.  <question>An event-based camera captures events generated by a rotating disk with non-uniform surface texture. The angular velocity of the disk is given by $\omega(t) = \alpha t + \beta$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants. Each event is characterized by its time $t_i$ and polar coordinates $(r_i, \theta_i)$. Assuming that events are uniformly distributed in the radial direction ($r$), and the density of events generated is proportional to the magnitude of angular acceleration, determine the average event rate as a function of time, denoted by $R(t)$, observed by the event camera within a radial range $r_1 \le r \le r_2$, assuming a constant proportionality factor $k$.</question>

4.  <question>Consider an event-based camera system used for tracking a projectile. The camera outputs a stream of events $(t_i, x_i, y_i)$, where $t_i$ is the timestamp and $(x_i, y_i)$ are the pixel coordinates of the $i$-th event. Assume the projectile follows a parabolic trajectory described by $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. The event generation is triggered by a change in contrast exceeding a threshold $\delta C$. Given a set of $N$ events, determine the optimal parameters $a, b, c$ that minimize the sum of squared distances from the events $(x_i, y_i)$ to the parabolic trajectory. Express the result for parameter $a$ in terms of the other parameters and event data.</question>

5.  <question>An event-based camera is mounted on a robot moving with constant linear velocity $v$ along the x-axis. The camera observes a static sinusoidal grating pattern described by the intensity function $I(x, y) = I_0 + A\cos(2\pi f x)$, where $I_0$ is the average intensity, $A$ is the amplitude, and $f$ is the spatial frequency. The camera generates events when the temporal derivative of the log intensity exceeds a threshold $\theta$, i.e., $|\frac{d}{dt}\ln(I)| > \theta$. Calculate the maximum event rate generated by the camera as a function of $v$, $A$, $I_0$, $f$, and the spatial extent $L$ of the grating pattern in the y-direction, assuming the grating is large enough such that the event threshold is always exceeded somewhere.</question>

Here's a critique of each question based on your guidelines, along with actionable feedback:

---

**1. Question Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Input Format):** Pass. Fully text-based.
*   **Guideline 2 (Mathematical Structure):** Pass. Well-defined setup.
*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** Pass. Asks for a clear symbolic result.
*   **Guideline 4 (Single Output):** Pass. Expects a single symbolic expression.
*   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** Pass, with a minor note. The constant $\theta$ is introduced as a threshold but is not used in the final requested calculation (the maximum value of $|dL/dt|$). While it provides context, it could be seen as slightly irrelevant for the *specific output requested*.
*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Pass. Unique problem combining kinematics and calculus within a specific sensor model.
*   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Pass. Requires differentiation (chain rule), magnitude calculation, and optimization.
*   **Guideline 8 (Solution Formatting):** Pass. Question uses appropriate LaTeX markdown (`$...$`).
*   **Guideline 9 (Language and Notation):** Pass. Rigorous and consistent.
*   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Pass. Asks for one value.
*   **Guideline 11 (No Answers/Solutions):** Pass. Only question provided.
*   **Guideline 12 (No Numeric Approximations):** Pass. Seeks a symbolic result.

**Actionable Feedback 1:**
The constant $\theta$ is not directly used in calculating the maximum value of $|dL/dt|$. Consider if its inclusion truly adds mathematical value to the requested output, or if it's purely descriptive. If purely descriptive, it's acceptable, but its presence might subtly mislead a student to think it should appear in the final expression.

---

**2. Question Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Input Format):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 2 (Mathematical Structure):** Pass, but the setup contains significant irrelevant information.
*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** Pass. Asks for a clear symbolic matrix (which will be scalar due to simplification).
*   **Guideline 4 (Single Output):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** **Fail.** This is the primary issue. The detailed description of $\vec{p}(t)$, $\vec{v}(t)$, and the full diagonal covariance matrices $Q$ and $R$ (with $q_y, q_z, r_y, r_z$) becomes largely irrelevant due to the explicit simplification: "assuming a simplified linear model where the state is just $\dot{x}(t)$ and the measurement is a direct observation of $\dot{x}(t)$." This reduction makes only $q_x$ and $r_x$ relevant.
*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Pass, but the drastic simplification makes it less challenging and possibly bordering on trivial for someone familiar with 1D Kalman filters.
*   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Pass. Requires applying Kalman filter steady-state equations, but for a simplified 1D case.
*   **Guideline 8 (Solution Formatting):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 9 (Language and Notation):** Pass, but "Kalman gain matrix" for a scalar state is slightly awkward.
*   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 11 (No Answers/Solutions):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 12 (No Numeric Approximations):** Pass.

**Actionable Feedback 2:**
The question contains excessive irrelevant information. To adhere to Guideline 5 ("Concise and Relevant"), remove all parameters and descriptions related to the $y$ and $z$ components of the target's motion and the noise covariance matrices ($q_y, q_z, r_y, r_z$) that are explicitly discarded by the "simplified linear model" assumption. Rephrase the problem to focus directly on the 1D system. For example: "Consider a Kalman filter for estimating a 1D state $\dot{x}(t)$. The process noise covariance is $q_x$ and the measurement noise covariance is $r_x$. Assuming the measurement is a direct observation of $\dot{x}(t)$, determine the steady-state Kalman gain $K_\infty$."

**3. Question Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Input Format):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 2 (Mathematical Structure):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** Pass. Asks for a clear symbolic function.
*   **Guideline 4 (Single Output):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** **Fail (Ambiguity in definitions).** The phrase "density of events generated is proportional to the magnitude of angular acceleration" combined with "uniformly distributed in the radial direction ($r$)" is ambiguous.
    *   Does "density" refer to events per unit area per unit time, or a total event rate per unit radial interval?
    *   If it means a spatial density, "uniformly distributed in the radial direction ($r$)" is ill-defined in the context of area (an area element $dA=rdrd\theta$ is not uniform in $r$). Does it mean uniform number of events per unit radial *length* or uniform event probability density over $r$? This significantly impacts how the radial range $r_1 \le r \le r_2$ is incorporated into the average event rate.
*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Pass. Seems unique.
*   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Pass, assuming the ambiguities are resolved.
*   **Guideline 8 (Solution Formatting):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 9 (Language and Notation):** Fail (Ambiguity). The terms "density" and "uniformly distributed in the radial direction" lack the mathematical precision needed for a unique interpretation and solution. "non-uniform surface texture" is also irrelevant flavor text.
*   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 11 (No Answers/Solutions):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 12 (No Numeric Approximations):** Pass.

**Actionable Feedback 3:**
Crucially clarify the definition of "density of events generated" and how it relates to the "event rate." Specify if it's an event rate per unit area (e.g., events per $m^2$ per second), or a total event rate from the specified region. Also, define "uniformly distributed in the radial direction" more precisely. For instance, "the event rate per unit area is constant for a given radius $r$ across all angles, and the integral of this rate over the angular range $2\pi$ is proportional to the angular acceleration, with its distribution over $r$ being uniform (i.e., the number of events generated in an annulus of thickness $dr$ is proportional to $dr$)." Or simply state "the total event rate generated within an annulus $r_1 \le r \le r_2$ is proportional to the magnitude of angular acceleration and the radial extent $(r_2-r_1)$." Remove "non-uniform surface texture" as it's not mathematically utilized.

**4. Question Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Input Format):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 2 (Mathematical Structure):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** Pass. Asks for a clear symbolic expression.
*   **Guideline 4 (Single Output):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** **Fail (Irrelevant detail and Ambiguity).**
    *   "The event generation is triggered by a change in contrast exceeding a threshold $\delta C$" is irrelevant context for a least-squares fitting problem based on given events.
    *   The phrase "sum of squared distances from the events $(x_i, y_i)$ to the parabolic trajectory" is highly ambiguous. In least squares for $y=f(x)$, this commonly implies sum of squared *vertical* distances ($y_i - (ax_i^2+bx_i+c))^2$). However, "distance" strictly implies perpendicular distance, which would make this a significantly more complex, non-linear least-squares problem, likely requiring iterative methods and thus violating Guideline 12 ("No numeric approximations" and "traditional mathematical methods" implying direct algebraic solution).
*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** **Fail.** This is a very standard textbook problem: least squares fitting of a polynomial. The "event-based camera" context serves as mere window dressing and does not make the problem unique or non-trivial.
*   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Pass, assuming it implies vertical distances.
*   **Guideline 8 (Solution Formatting):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 9 (Language and Notation):** Fail (Ambiguity). The ambiguity of "distance" needs to be resolved.
*   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 11 (No Answers/Solutions):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 12 (No Numeric Approximations):** Pass, assuming vertical distances are implied.

**Actionable Feedback 4:**
This question significantly violates Guideline 6 (Originality) and Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant).
1.  **Redesign for originality:** Create a problem where the "event-based camera" context genuinely drives a unique mathematical challenge beyond a standard textbook fit.
2.  **Clarify "distance":** Crucially, specify whether "distance" refers to the sum of squared *vertical* distances (residuals in $y$) or the sum of squared *perpendicular* distances. For the expected level (symbolic, non-iterative solution), "vertical distance" is almost certainly intended and should be explicitly stated.
3.  **Remove irrelevant detail:** Omit the sentence about event generation being triggered by contrast change, as it plays no role in the least-squares calculation.

**5. Question Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Input Format):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 2 (Mathematical Structure):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** Pass. Asks for a clear symbolic result.
*   **Guideline 4 (Single Output):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** **Fail (Major Ambiguity in defining "rate").** The intensity function $I(x,y)$ only depends on $x$. When the condition $|\frac{d}{dt}\ln(I)| > \theta$ is met for a given $x$, it is met for *all* $y$ along that vertical line (within the extent $L$). If "maximum event rate" implies the total number of events generated per unit time across the entire y-extent $L$, and the camera has continuous sensing along $y$, this rate would be infinite or ill-defined without a concept of "events per unit length in y" or discrete pixels. The inclusion of $L$ strongly suggests it should factor into the rate, but the mechanism for doing so is undefined, leading to a major ambiguity.
*   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Pass, but the ambiguity limits its quality.
*   **Guideline 7 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Pass, assuming the "rate" ambiguity is resolved.
*   **Guideline 8 (Solution Formatting):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 9 (Language and Notation):** Fail (Ambiguity). The definition of "maximum event rate" in the context of events occurring simultaneously along a continuous line is not precise enough.
*   **Guideline 10 (Single Part):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 11 (No Answers/Solutions):** Pass.
*   **Guideline 12 (No Numeric Approximations):** Pass.

**Actionable Feedback 5:**
The major flaw is the ambiguity in how "maximum event rate" is defined when the intensity function does not depend on $y$. To make the problem solvable and unambiguous, you must specify how events are counted in the $y$-direction.
*   **Option 1 (Preferred):** Define it as "maximum event rate per unit length in the y-direction". In this case, $L$ might not be part of the final answer for the *maximum* rate, or it would be $L$ times the maximum rate per unit length.
*   **Option 2:** State an assumption about discrete pixelization or a specific event density function along the $y$-axis (e.g., "assuming the camera has a uniform pixel density $\rho$ along the y-axis, determine the maximum *total* event rate observed over length $L$").
Without this clarification, the problem is ill-posed for a unique, finite symbolic answer involving $L$.

**Critique:**
*   **Strengths:** This question is well-structured and adheres to most guidelines. It has a clear setup, requires multi-step reasoning (vector magnitude, differentiation, finding max), asks for a clear symbolic result, and uses consistent notation. The inclusion of $\theta$ which isn't directly used in the final requested expression for the maximum value is acceptable as it sets the context for event detection.
*   **Weaknesses:** None significant.

**Actionable Feedback:** No specific changes needed.

**Question 2:**
<question>Consider a Kalman filter for estimating a 1D state $\dot{x}(t)$. The process noise covariance is $q_x$ and the measurement noise covariance is $r_x$. Assuming the measurement is a direct observation of $\dot{x}(t)$, determine the steady-state Kalman gain $K_\infty$.</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Strengths:** Clear solvable target, single output format, uses LaTeX.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** This is a very common and standard textbook problem for 1D steady-state Kalman gain. It lacks originality.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Mathematical Structure/Ambiguity):** The phrase "1D state $\dot{x}(t)$" is ambiguous. It doesn't specify if $\dot{x}(t)$ is a constant value being estimated, or if it represents a continuous-time varying state for which a discrete-time Kalman filter is implicitly assumed. This ambiguity affects the underlying system model and the derivation. Kalman filters are typically discrete-time, and if the state is $\dot{x}(t)$, its dynamics need to be defined (e.g., $\dot{x}_{k+1} = \dot{x}_k + w_k$ for a constant velocity model).
    *   **Guideline 9 (Language and Notation):** While $q_x$ and $r_x$ are used, standard notation for process and measurement noise covariances is $Q$ and $R$ respectively.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Increase Originality:** Rephrase to involve a more complex scenario (e.g., a 2D state, or a system with non-trivial dynamics where the steady-state gain isn't a direct formula application).
2.  **Clarify State and Dynamics:** Explicitly state the type of state (e.g., "estimating a constant 1D state $X$") and whether the Kalman filter is discrete-time, along with the system dynamics (e.g., "$X_k = X_{k-1} + w_k$").
3.  **Notation (Optional but Recommended):** Use $Q$ and $R$ for process and measurement noise covariance, respectively.

**Question 4:**
<question>Consider an event-based camera system used for tracking a projectile. The camera outputs a stream of events $(t_i, x_i, y_i)$, where $t_i$ is the timestamp and $(x_i, y_i)$ are the pixel coordinates of the $i$-th event. Assume the projectile follows a parabolic trajectory described by $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a$, b, and $c$ are constants. Given a set of $N$ events, determine the optimal parameters $a, b, c$ that minimize the sum of squared *vertical* distances from the events $(x_i, y_i)$ to the parabolic trajectory. Express the result for parameter $a$ in terms of the other parameters and event data.</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Strengths:** Clear setup, multi-step reasoning (least squares), uses LaTeX.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Least squares fitting of a polynomial is a very standard and well-known textbook problem. The context of an "event-based camera" does not change the core mathematical challenge.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Single Output) & 10 (Single Part):** The request "determine the optimal parameters $a, b, c$" followed by "Express the result for parameter $a$ in terms of the other parameters and event data" is highly ambiguous and problematic.
        *   If $a, b, c$ are all unknown parameters to be optimized, the final "optimal $a$" would be expressed solely in terms of the event data $(x_i, y_i)$, not in terms of $b$ and $c$ (which are also unknowns being solved for). This phrasing suggests an intermediate step in the derivation (e.g., the equation for $a$ from $\partial S/\partial a = 0$), which violates the "Solvable Target" (asks for final result, not intermediate steps) and "Single Output/Part" (as it's one equation of a system of equations).
        *   If it means finding the *full* solution for $a$ from the $3 \times 3$ system, then the phrase "in terms of the other parameters" is incorrect.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Increase Originality:** Consider a more complex curve fitting problem (e.g., non-linear regression where linearization isn't straightforward, or fitting to a 3D trajectory with a different form).
2.  **Clarify Output Request:** Rephrase the request for the solution to be unambiguous.
    *   **Option 1 (Recommended for single parameter):** "Determine the optimal value for parameter $a$ in terms of the event data." (This implies solving the full system and presenting only $a$).
    *   **Option 2 (For all parameters):** "Determine the optimal parameters $a, b, c$ that minimize the sum of squared vertical distances..." (This would typically expect a vector or set of expressions for all three parameters, which might then violate "Single Output" depending on interpretation. But it's a more standard LS output).

**Question 5:**
<question>An event-based camera is mounted on a robot moving with constant linear velocity $v$ along the x-axis. The camera observes a static sinusoidal grating pattern described by the intensity function $I(x) = I_0 + A\cos(2\pi f x)$, where $I_0$ is the average intensity, $A$ is the amplitude, and $f$ is the spatial frequency. The camera generates events when the temporal derivative of the log intensity exceeds a threshold $\theta$, i.e., $|\frac{d}{dt}\ln(I)| > \theta$. Calculate the maximum event rate *per unit length in the y-direction* generated by the camera as a function of $v$, $A$, $I_0$, and $f$, assuming the grating is large enough such that the event threshold is always exceeded somewhere.</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Strengths:** Good setup, multi-step calculation (differentiation, finding max), uses LaTeX.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target) & 5 (Concise and Relevant) & 9 (Language and Notation):** The phrase "maximum event rate *per unit length in the y-direction*" is ill-defined and problematic for an intensity function $I(x)$ that depends only on $x$ (i.e., is uniform along the y-axis).
        *   If $I(x)$ is uniform in $y$, then the temporal derivative of log intensity, $\frac{d}{dt}\ln(I)$, is the same for all $y$ at a given $x(t)$. This means events, if generated, would theoretically occur simultaneously along an entire vertical line (a "line event").
        *   An "event rate" is typically events per second. For a periodic pattern, this would be related to how many times the condition is met per second (e.g., $2fv$ if the magnitude of $dL/dt$ is high enough to trigger events twice per cycle).
        *   Dividing this temporal rate by "per unit length in the y-direction" makes no sense without a defined vertical extent for the camera or sensor, or a different interpretation of what "event" means in this 1D-intensity 2D-camera scenario. It's unclear what physical quantity is being asked for.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Clarify/Remove Ambiguous Quantity:**
    *   **Option 1 (Recommended):** Remove "per unit length in the y-direction" and ask for the "maximum *temporal* event rate" (events/second). This focuses on the temporal aspects of a 1D grating as it's scanned.
    *   **Option 2 (If specific meaning intended):** If "per unit length in the y-direction" has a precise, unstated physical meaning for this 1D $I(x)$ pattern, then it must be explicitly defined in the problem statement (e.g., "Assume the camera has a pixel height of $H_y$ and events are counted for each pixel," or redefine $I$ to be 2D, e.g., $I(x,y)$). Without such clarification, the problem's target quantity is ill-defined.

Okay, here's the revised list of questions, incorporating the feedback. I've focused on addressing the originality and ambiguity issues while preserving the core difficulty and applicability of the problems.

The total event rate generated within an annulus $r_1 \le r \le r_2$ is proportional to the magnitude of angular acceleration and the radial extent $(r_2-r_1)$, with a proportionality constant $k$. Determine the average event rate as a function of time, denoted by $R(t)$, observed by the event camera within the radial range $r_1 \le r \le r_2$.</question>

4.  <question>Consider an event-based camera system used for tracking the trajectory of a bouncing ball. The camera outputs a stream of events $(t_i, x_i, y_i)$, where $t_i$ is the timestamp and $(x_i, y_i)$ are the pixel coordinates of the $i$-th event. Assume the ball's trajectory between bounces can be locally approximated by a parabolic segment described by $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$. Given a set of $N$ events, determine the optimal value for the parameter $a$ (representing the curvature of the parabola) in terms of the event data $(x_i, y_i)$ only, where $h$ and $k$ are *known* parameters representing the vertex of the parabola. Assume a least-squares minimization of the sum of squared *vertical* distances is used.</question>

5.  <question>An event-based camera is mounted on a robot moving with constant linear velocity $v$ along the x-axis. The camera observes a static sinusoidal grating pattern described by the intensity function $I(x) = I_0 + A\cos(2\pi f x)$, where $I_0$ is the average intensity, $A$ is the amplitude, and $f$ is the spatial frequency. The camera generates events when the temporal derivative of the log intensity exceeds a threshold $\theta$, i.e., $|\frac{d}{dt}\ln(I)| > \theta$. Calculate the maximum *temporal* event rate generated by the camera as a function of $v$, $A$, $I_0$, and $f$, assuming the grating is large enough such that the event threshold is always exceeded somewhere.</question>
