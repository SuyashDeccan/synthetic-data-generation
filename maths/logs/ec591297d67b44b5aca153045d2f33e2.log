Here's a critique of each question against the provided guidelines, with concise, actionable feedback:

**General Feedback:**
A fundamental issue is that these are presented as "novel university-level **physics** questions", but all are purely **mathematics** problems (Probability, Statistics, and Abstract Algebra). My critique will treat them as mathematics questions, as indicated by my role. The most significant weakness across all questions is a lack of originality for a "novel university-level" context. Many are standard textbook exercises.

---

**Question 1:** *Consider a game where a player rolls a fair $n$-sided die, with faces numbered $1$ to $n$. Let $X$ be the number rolled. The player then receives $X^2$ dollars. What is the expected value of the player's winnings?*

*   **Mathematical Topic:** Probability, Expected Value.
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** This is a very standard, foundational problem for calculating the expected value of a function of a discrete random variable, commonly found in introductory probability textbooks. It lacks originality for a "novel university-level" question.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Solution Formatting):** The number $1$ in "faces numbered $1$ to $n$" should be enclosed in dollar signs as it represents a numerical value within the mathematical setup (e.g., $1$ to $n$).
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To improve originality, consider introducing a more complex distribution for $X$, a non-linear payout function with piecewise rules, or making the die roll conditional on previous events.

---

**Question 2:** *Let $G$ be a group with elements $\{e, a, b, c\}$ where $e$ is the identity element. Suppose the group operation $*$ is defined such that $a*a = b$, $b*b = e$, and $c*c = e$. Determine the group multiplication table and identify if $G$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_4$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$. If $G$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$, define the isomorphism. Express the result by defining the mapping $f: G \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$.*

*   **Mathematical Topic:** Abstract Algebra, Group Theory (Classification of Groups of Order 4).
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** Asking to "Determine the group multiplication table" and "define the isomorphism" are not requests for a "clear symbolic result". A table is a structured output, and defining a mapping is a process.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Single Output):** This question clearly asks for multiple outputs: a multiplication table, an identification of isomorphism (which group), and a specific mapping. This violates the requirement for a single, unambiguous symbolic answer.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Classifying groups of order 4 based on given properties is a very common exercise in introductory group theory. It's a standard textbook problem, not novel.
    *   **Guideline 10 (No multiple parts):** The question explicitly has multiple parts (table, identification, mapping definition).
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Rephrase to ask for a single, symbolic answer. For example, "What is the order of element $c$ in the group $G$ defined by the given properties?" or "Is $G$ a cyclic group? Provide the smallest integer $k$ such that $G \cong \mathbb{Z}_k$ if it is, or state 'No' otherwise."

---

**Question 3:** *A box contains 3 red balls and 2 blue balls. Two balls are drawn without replacement. Given that at least one of the balls is red, what is the probability that both balls are red?*

*   **Mathematical Topic:** Probability, Conditional Probability.
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** This is a classic and very common conditional probability problem, often used as a direct example or exercise in introductory probability courses. It lacks originality for a "novel university-level" question.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Solution Formatting):** The numbers $3$ and $2$ in the problem description should be enclosed in dollar signs (e.g., $3$ red balls and $2$ blue balls).
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To increase novelty, consider a setup with more stages, different types of dependencies, or a dynamic element where the composition of the box changes.

---

**Question 4:** *Consider a set $S = \{a, b, c\}$ with a binary operation $*$ defined such that $(S, *)$ forms a group. If $a * b = c$, and $a$ is not the identity element, and the order of $a$ is 3, construct the Cayley table for this group. What is the value of $b*a$?*

*   **Mathematical Topic:** Abstract Algebra, Group Theory (Cayley Tables, Group Properties).
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** Asking to "construct the Cayley table" is not a request for a "clear symbolic result". A table is a structured output.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Single Output):** The question asks for both a Cayley table and the value of $b*a$. This is not a single, unambiguous symbolic answer.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Constructing the Cayley table for a group of order 3 (which must be cyclic, i.e., isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_3$) is a standard textbook exercise in abstract algebra. It is not novel.
    *   **Guideline 10 (No multiple parts):** The question explicitly has two parts: constructing a table and determining a specific product.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Rephrase to ask for a single, symbolic value. For example, "What is the value of $b*a$?" or "What is the identity element of the group $S$?"

---

**Question 5:** *A biased coin has a probability $p$ of landing heads. You flip the coin $n$ times. Let $X$ be the number of heads. What is the expected value of $X^3$?*

*   **Mathematical Topic:** Probability, Expected Value (Moments of Binomial Distribution).
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** While $E[X^3]$ for a binomial distribution ($X \sim B(n,p)$) is not as elementary as $E[X]$ or $E[X^2]$, it is a standard calculation in a course covering moments of distributions (often derived using factorial moments or moment generating functions). It's more of a standard derivation/application of techniques rather than a "novel" problem.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** Depending on the expected solution method, deriving $E[X^3]$ from first principles could be considered a "derivation", which the guidelines state questions must not be. If the expectation is to use a pre-existing formula, then it's acceptable.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To enhance novelty, consider a scenario involving conditional expectations of powers, or functions of multiple random variables, or a context that makes the calculation more abstract or less direct.

---

**Question 6:** *Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a probability space. Suppose $A, B, C \in \mathcal{F}$ are events such that $P(A) = 0.6$, $P(B) = 0.5$, $P(C) = 0.4$, $P(A \cap B) = 0.3$, $P(A \cap C) = 0.2$, $P(B \cap C) = 0.1$, and $P(A \cap B \cap C) = 0.05$. What is the probability of $A \cup B \cup C$?*

*   **Mathematical Topic:** Probability, Set Operations, Inclusion-Exclusion Principle.
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** This is a direct and extremely common application of the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion for three sets. It's a standard textbook problem, lacking novelty.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Solution Formatting):** Numerical values in the problem statement (e.g., $0.6, 0.5$, etc.) should be enclosed in dollar signs for consistent mathematical formatting (e.g., $P(A) = 0.6$).
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To improve originality, modify the problem to require deducing some of the intersection probabilities from conditional information, or involve a more complex event structure (e.g., exactly two events occur).

---

**Question 7:** *Consider a game where you roll a fair six-sided die. If you roll a 1 or 2, you win \$1. If you roll a 3 or 4, you win \$2. If you roll a 5 or 6, you lose \$3. What is the expected value of this game?*

*   **Mathematical Topic:** Probability, Expected Value.
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** This is a fundamental, boilerplate problem for introducing the concept of expected value in introductory probability. It is far from novel for a university level.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Solution Formatting):** Numbers and values (e.g., $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$, win $1, win $2, lose $3) are not consistently formatted using dollar signs for mathematical expressions (e.g., If you roll a $1$ or $2$, you win $\$1$).
*   **Actionable Feedback:** This problem is too basic for a university-level "novel" question. Increase complexity by introducing multiple stages, decision points, or variable payouts.

---

**Question 8:** *Let $G$ be a group. Suppose $a, b \in G$ such that $a^2 = e$ and $b^3 = e$, where $e$ is the identity element. If $aba = b^2$, what is the order of the element $ab$?*

*   **Mathematical Topic:** Abstract Algebra, Group Theory (Orders of Elements, Group Relations).
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** This type of problem, involving deriving the order of a composite element from given relations and orders of individual elements, is a standard exercise in introductory group theory. While it requires some algebraic manipulation, it is not particularly novel or unique.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To increase novelty, embed the problem within a specific, less common group structure, or introduce more abstract relations that require deeper theoretical insights.

---

**Question 9:** *Two fair dice are rolled. Let $X$ be the sum of the numbers rolled. Given that $X$ is even, what is the probability that $X$ is greater than or equal to 8?*

*   **Mathematical Topic:** Probability, Conditional Probability.
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** This is a very common conditional probability problem involving dice rolls, often appearing in introductory probability textbooks and exercises. It lacks originality.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Solution Formatting):** The number $8$ and the word "Two" (representing "two dice") should be enclosed in dollar signs (e.g., $X$ is greater than or equal to $8$).
*   **Actionable Feedback:** This is too standard for a novel university-level question. Make it more complex by involving three or more dice, different types of dice, or a more intricate conditional event.

---

**Question 10:** *Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables, where $X$ follows a uniform distribution on $[0, 1]$ and $Y$ follows an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\lambda$. What is the probability that $X < Y$?*

*   **Mathematical Topic:** Probability, Continuous Random Variables, Joint Distributions, Integration.
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Originality):** Calculating the probability of $X < Y$ for specific continuous distributions (like uniform and exponential) is a common type of problem in a second course in probability or mathematical statistics. It's a standard application of integration over a joint density or conditioning, not particularly unique.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To enhance novelty, consider a scenario with dependent random variables, or a more complex region for integration, or a function of $X$ and $Y$ (e.g., $P(X+Y < c)$ or $P(\min(X,Y) < Z)$).
=== Turn 1: Author refines questions ===
Okay, I understand. Based on your feedback, I will create a new set of questions focusing on being both more original and suitable for a university-level *physics* context (rather than pure mathematics). The key changes will be to integrate probabilistic/statistical concepts *into physical scenarios* and to move away from standard textbook examples. I will assume familiarity with undergraduate physics concepts like electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics. I'll also adhere to your formatting suggestions.

1.  <question>A particle of mass $m$ is confined to a one-dimensional infinite potential well of width $L$. Its initial wavefunction at time $t=0$ is given by $\Psi(x, 0) = A( \sin(\pi x/L) + \sin(2\pi x/L) + \sin(3\pi x/L))$. Due to a manufacturing defect, the width of the well, $L$, fluctuates randomly according to a Gaussian distribution with mean $L_0$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, where $\sigma << L_0$. Estimate the uncertainty in the energy of the particle in the ground state at $t=0$, considering the uncertainty in $L$. Express your answer in terms of $m$, $L_0$, $\sigma$, and fundamental constants.</question>

2.  <question>Consider a classical ideal gas of $N$ particles in a volume $V$ at temperature $T$. Each particle has a permanent electric dipole moment $\mathbf{p}$. The gas is placed in a uniform external electric field $\mathbf{E}$. Assuming the dipole moments are randomly oriented, what is the probability that the net dipole moment of the entire gas lies within a cone of half-angle $\theta$ around the direction of $\mathbf{E}$? Give an approximate answer valid for large $N$, expressing your result in terms of $N$, $\theta$, $\mathbf{p}$, $\mathbf{E}$, $V$, $T$, and fundamental constants.</question>

3.  <question>A cosmic ray muon with initial energy $E_0$ enters the Earth's atmosphere. As it travels through the atmosphere, it loses energy due to ionization at a rate of $-dE/dx = b$, where $b$ is a constant. However, there is also a probability that the muon decays with a decay constant $\lambda$. Given that the density of the atmosphere varies with height $h$ as $\rho(h) = \rho_0 e^{-h/H}$, where $H$ is the scale height, determine the probability that the muon reaches the surface of the Earth (height $h=0$) without decaying. Express your answer in terms of $E_0$, $b$, $\lambda$, $\rho_0$, $H$, the muon mass $m_\mu$, the speed of light $c$, and fundamental constants. Assume the muon's trajectory is nearly vertical.</question>

4.  <question>A simplified model of a laser consists of $N$ two-level atoms confined within a cavity. The atoms can be in either the ground state ($E_1 = 0$) or the excited state ($E_2 = \hbar\omega$). Initially, all atoms are in the ground state. A pump mechanism instantaneously excites $n$ atoms to the excited state, where $n$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\bar{n}$. Assuming that stimulated emission is the dominant process, and the transition rate for stimulated emission is proportional to the number of photons in the cavity, derive an expression for the probability distribution of the number of photons in the cavity after a long time, assuming the number of photons is much larger than $1$ (treat photon number as a continuous variable). Hint: Consider the Fokker-Planck equation</question>

5. <question>A spherical blackbody with radius $r$ and temperature $T$ is orbiting a distant star at a distance $d$. The star has a radius $R$ and a surface temperature $T_s$. Assume that the blackbody's orbit is much larger than both the blackbody radius and the star radius, so that the blackbody subtends a small solid angle as seen from the star, and vice versa. Due to imperfect knowledge of the blackbody's albedo, its emissivity, $\epsilon$, is known only to lie within a range $[\epsilon_0 - \delta, \epsilon_0 + \delta]$, where $\delta \ll \epsilon_0$. Determine the expected range of the equilibrium temperature of the blackbody, taking into account this uncertainty in the emissivity and the geometry of the system. Express the equilibrium temperature in terms of $r$, $R$, $T_s$, $d$, $\epsilon_0$, $\delta$ and fundamental constants.</question>
=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of your questions against the provided guidelines:

---

**Question 1:**
<question>A particle of mass $m$ is confined to a one-dimensional infinite potential well of width $L$. Its initial wavefunction at time $t=0$ is given by $\Psi(x, 0) = A( \sin(\pi x/L) + \sin(2\pi x/L) + \sin(3\pi x/L))$. Due to a manufacturing defect, the width of the well, $L$, fluctuates randomly according to a Gaussian distribution with mean $L_0$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, where $\sigma << L_0$. Estimate the uncertainty in the energy of the particle in the ground state at $t=0$, considering the uncertainty in $L$. Express your answer in terms of $m$, $L_0$, $\sigma$, and fundamental constants.</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** "Estimate the uncertainty in the energy... in the ground state at $t=0$, considering the uncertainty in $L$." The initial wavefunction given is a superposition, not the ground state. This creates a contradiction. The question should either ask for the uncertainty in the ground state energy *only* (ignoring the given $\Psi(x,0)$ entirely, which would make the $\Psi(x,0)$ part irrelevant and violate Guideline 5) or ask for the uncertainty in the *expected* energy given the initial state and the uncertainty in $L$. As phrased, it's ambiguous what "the energy of the particle in the ground state" refers to when an initial superposition is provided.
*   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** The initial wavefunction $\Psi(x,0) = A( \sin(\pi x/L) + \sin(2\pi x/L) + \sin(3\pi x/L))$ is irrelevant if the question asks for the "uncertainty in the energy of the particle in the ground state." If the intent was to ask for the uncertainty of the *expected energy* of the given state, then it's relevant, but the phrasing is contradictory. This needs clarification to avoid extraneous information.
*   **Guideline 8 (Solution Formatting):** "fundamental constants" should be specified or implied to be standard ones like $\hbar$. While common, explicitly stating "$m$, $L_0$, $\sigma$, and $\hbar$" or similar would be clearer.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  Clarify the target: Either remove the initial wavefunction $\Psi(x,0)$ if you genuinely want the uncertainty in the ground state energy due to $L$ fluctuations, or rephrase the question to ask for the uncertainty in the *expected energy* of the particle given its initial state $\Psi(x,0)$ *and* the uncertainty in $L$. The current phrasing creates a logical inconsistency.
2.  Explicitly list all required constants (e.g., $\hbar$) in the "Express your answer in terms of..." section.

---

**Question 2:**
<question>Consider a classical ideal gas of $N$ particles in a volume $V$ at temperature $T$. Each particle has a permanent electric dipole moment $\mathbf{p}$. The gas is placed in a uniform external electric field $\mathbf{E}$. Assuming the dipole moments are randomly oriented, what is the probability that the net dipole moment of the entire gas lies within a cone of half-angle $\theta$ around the direction of $\mathbf{E}$? Give an approximate answer valid for large $N$, expressing your result in terms of $N$, $\theta$, $\mathbf{p}$, $\mathbf{E}$, $V$, $T$, and fundamental constants.</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** The phrase "Assuming the dipole moments are randomly oriented" contradicts the presence of an external electric field $\mathbf{E}$, which would cause the dipoles to align (or tend to align) with the field, leading to a non-random distribution (e.g., Boltzmann distribution). This needs clarification. If "randomly oriented" means *initially* random, but then they evolve/equilibrate, the problem formulation needs to indicate the equilibrium state. If it implies that the field is too weak to cause significant alignment, that should be stated (e.g., "assuming $pE \ll k_B T$").
*   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** The volume $V$ is generally irrelevant for properties related to the average dipole moment or its distribution, as it's an intensive property related to individual particles or the system's state. It might be relevant if particle density affects interaction, but for an ideal gas with permanent dipoles, it's usually not. Unless there's a specific reason, $V$ can likely be removed.
*   **Guideline 8 (Solution Formatting):** Similar to Q1, "fundamental constants" should be specified. "$k_B$" for Boltzmann constant would be expected.
*   **Guideline 11 (No Answers/Hints):** While not explicitly a "hint," the "approximate answer valid for large $N$" guides the student towards a specific method (e.g., central limit theorem, statistical mechanics approximation for large N). This is arguably a hint by narrowing down the approach.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  Clarify the initial assumption regarding dipole orientation in the presence of $\mathbf{E}$. Is it an equilibrium problem where dipoles are oriented according to a Boltzmann distribution, or is it truly initial randomness despite the field? If the former, remove "randomly oriented."
2.  Review the relevance of $V$. If it's not essential, remove it from the list of variables.
3.  Specify fundamental constants (e.g., $k_B$).
4.  Remove the phrasing "Give an approximate answer valid for large $N$" as it guides the solution strategy. The problem should implicitly require a large $N$ approximation if it's necessary for solvability.

---

**Question 3:**
<question>A cosmic ray muon with initial energy $E_0$ enters the Earth's atmosphere. As it travels through the atmosphere, it loses energy due to ionization at a rate of $-dE/dx = b$, where $b$ is a constant. However, there is also a probability that the muon decays with a decay constant $\lambda$. Given that the density of the atmosphere varies with height $h$ as $\rho(h) = \rho_0 e^{-h/H}$, where $H$ is the scale height, determine the probability that the muon reaches the surface of the Earth (height $h=0$) without decaying. Express your answer in terms of $E_0$, $b$, $\lambda$, $\rho_0$, $H$, the muon mass $m_\mu$, the speed of light $c$, and fundamental constants. Assume the muon's trajectory is nearly vertical.</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** "determine the probability that the muon reaches the surface of the Earth (height $h=0$) without decaying." This implies the muon must have enough energy to reach the surface. The energy loss rate $b$ implies a maximum travel distance for a given initial energy. The question needs to ensure this is a well-defined condition; i.e., it must be possible for the muon to reach $h=0$ without losing all its energy. This implicitly adds an energy condition that might not always be met, but the question asks for a single probability. This is fine as long as the student is expected to integrate this condition into the probability calculation.
*   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** The density variation $\rho(h)$ and $\rho_0$ seem irrelevant if the energy loss rate $-dE/dx = b$ is given as a *constant*. Energy loss due to ionization typically depends on the density of the medium (e.g., Bethe-Bloch formula). If $b$ is truly constant *regardless of density*, then $\rho(h)$, $\rho_0$, and $H$ are superfluous information and should be removed (violating Guideline 5). If $b$ represents a rate per *unit mass* of atmosphere encountered, and the actual energy loss per unit length is $b \cdot \rho(h)$, then the question needs to clarify this relationship.
*   **Guideline 8 (Solution Formatting):** "fundamental constants" should be specified (e.g., $c$ is listed, but perhaps $k_B$ if temperature played a role, or just keep it simple). The muon mass $m_\mu$ and speed of light $c$ are listed as variables, but $c$ is a fundamental constant. This is a minor point, but consistency is good.
*   **Guideline 11 (No Answers/Hints):** The "Assume the muon's trajectory is nearly vertical" is a simplification that streamlines the problem, which is acceptable and not a hint.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  Clarify the relationship between $b$ and the atmospheric density $\rho(h)$. If $b$ is a constant rate *per unit length*, then $\rho(h)$, $\rho_0$, and $H$ are indeed extraneous and should be removed. If $b$ is, for example, the energy loss per unit *mass traversed* (or $b$ is a coefficient such that $-dE/dx = b \cdot \rho(h)$), then this relationship must be explicitly stated to make $\rho(h)$ relevant. This is the most critical feedback point.
2.  If the problem intends to be solvable without explicit consideration of the Bethe-Bloch formula, ensure that the definition of $b$ makes sense with the variable density.

---

**Question 4:**
<question>A simplified model of a laser consists of $N$ two-level atoms confined within a cavity. The atoms can be in either the ground state ($E_1 = 0$) or the excited state ($E_2 = \hbar\omega$). Initially, all atoms are in the ground state. A pump mechanism instantaneously excites $n$ atoms to the excited state, where $n$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\bar{n}$. Assuming that stimulated emission is the dominant process, and the transition rate for stimulated emission is proportional to the number of photons in the cavity, derive an expression for the probability distribution of the number of photons in the cavity after a long time, assuming the number of photons is much larger than $1$ (treat photon number as a continuous variable). Hint: Consider the Fokker-Planck equation</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** "derive an expression for the probability distribution..." The guideline states "Questions must not be proves or derivations." Asking to "derive an expression" falls under this exclusion. The question should ask for "an expression for..."
*   **Guideline 11 (No Answers/Hints):** "Hint: Consider the Fokker-Planck equation" directly violates Guideline 11. Hints are explicitly forbidden.
*   **Guideline 9 (Language and Notation):** "treat photon number as a continuous variable" is a common approximation in such problems but should be phrased as part of the model setup rather than an instruction on how to solve it. For example, "Assuming the photon number can be approximated as a continuous variable..."
*   **Guideline 4 (Single Output):** The question asks for a "probability distribution," which implies a function $P(k)$ or $P(N_{photons})$. This is acceptable as a single symbolic result.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  Change "derive an expression for" to "Determine an expression for" or "Find an expression for" to comply with Guideline 3.
2.  **Remove the hint entirely.** This is a direct violation of Guideline 11.
3.  Rephrase "treat photon number as a continuous variable" to be part of the problem setup/assumptions if desired.

**Question 5:**
<question>A spherical blackbody with radius $r$ and temperature $T$ is orbiting a distant star at a distance $d$. The star has a radius $R$ and a surface temperature $T_s$. Assume that the blackbody's orbit is much larger than both the blackbody radius and the star radius, so that the blackbody subtends a small solid angle as seen from the star, and vice versa. Due to imperfect knowledge of the blackbody's albedo, its emissivity, $\epsilon$, is known only to lie within a range $[\epsilon_0 - \delta, \epsilon_0 + \delta]$, where $\delta \ll \epsilon_0$. Determine the expected range of the equilibrium temperature of the blackbody, taking into account this uncertainty in the emissivity and the geometry of the system. Express the equilibrium temperature in terms of $r$, $R$, $T_s$, $d$, $\epsilon_0$, $\delta$ and fundamental constants.</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 2 (Mathematical Structure):** The setup is clear.
*   **Guideline 3 (Solvable Target):** "Determine the expected range of the equilibrium temperature..." A "range" typically means an interval, e.g., $[T_{min}, T_{max}]$. This implies two symbolic expressions (for $T_{min}$ and $T_{max}$).
*   **Guideline 4 (Single Output):** Asking for a "range" implies two values (minimum and maximum temperature) rather than a single symbolic answer. While closely related, it's not a *single* expression like a function or a single value.
*   **Guideline 5 (Concise and Relevant):** The blackbody's own temperature $T$ is given as a variable in the first sentence ("temperature $T$ is orbiting"), but the question asks for its *equilibrium* temperature. The given $T$ is likely irrelevant or confusing; it should be removed to avoid implying it's an initial condition for a dynamic process or a property to be used in the solution.
*   **Guideline 8 (Solution Formatting):** "fundamental constants" should be specified (e.g., Stefan-Boltzmann constant $\sigma_{SB}$).
*   **Guideline 9 (Language and Notation):** "blackbody's albedo, its emissivity, $\epsilon$". For a perfect blackbody, albedo is $0$ and emissivity is $1$. However, the problem then states $\epsilon$ is uncertain. This implies the object is *not* a perfect blackbody, despite being called a "blackbody" in the first sentence. This is a common simplification in physics problems but can be confusing. It would be clearer to state "A spherical object (which can be approximated as a blackbody in some respects) with radius $r$..." or explicitly state that it has an emissivity $\epsilon$ and absorption coefficient $\alpha$ (which would then be equal for thermal equilibrium).

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  Rephrase the question to ask for a single symbolic output. Instead of "expected range," ask for the equilibrium temperature *as a function of* $\epsilon$, and then the student can infer the range. Or, if the range is truly desired, state that the answer should be a pair of expressions, e.g., "$T_{min}$ and $T_{max}$." (However, Guideline 10 strictly says "only one single solution.") To strictly adhere to Guideline 10, it should be phrased as asking for *an expression* for the equilibrium temperature $T_{eq}(\epsilon)$ in terms of the given parameters, from which the range can be inferred.
2.  Remove the initial mention of "temperature $T$" for the blackbody, as it's the equilibrium temperature being sought.
3.  Specify fundamental constants (e.g., $\sigma_{SB}$).
4.  Clarify the "blackbody" terminology if it is not a perfect blackbody. Perhaps "A spherical object with radius $r$ and emissivity $\epsilon$..."

Okay, I've refined the questions based on your detailed feedback, focusing on clarity, consistency, and adherence to the guidelines. Here are the revised questions:

1.  <question>A particle of mass $m$ is confined to a one-dimensional infinite potential well of width $L$. Its initial wavefunction at time $t=0$ is given by $\Psi(x, 0) = A( \sin(\pi x/L) + \sin(2\pi x/L) + \sin(3\pi x/L))$. Due to a manufacturing defect, the width of the well, $L$, fluctuates randomly according to a Gaussian distribution with mean $L_0$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, where $\sigma << L_0$. Estimate the uncertainty in the *expected value* of the energy of the particle at $t=0$, given the uncertainty in $L$. Express your answer in terms of $m$, $L_0$, $\sigma$, and the reduced Planck constant $\hbar$.</question>

2.  <question>Consider a classical ideal gas of $N$ particles in a volume $V$ at temperature $T$. Each particle has a permanent electric dipole moment $\mathbf{p}$. The gas is placed in a uniform external electric field $\mathbf{E}$, where $pE \ll k_B T$. What is the probability that the net dipole moment of the entire gas lies within a cone of half-angle $\theta$ around the direction of $\mathbf{E}$? Express your result in terms of $N$, $\theta$, $\mathbf{p}$, $\mathbf{E}$, $T$, and the Boltzmann constant $k_B$.</question>

3.  <question>A cosmic ray muon with initial energy $E_0$ enters the Earth's atmosphere. As it travels through the atmosphere, it loses energy due to ionization at a rate of $-dE/dx = b$, where $b$ is a constant. There is also a probability that the muon decays with a decay constant $\lambda$. Determine the probability that the muon reaches the surface of the Earth (height $h=0$) without decaying, assuming that $E_0$ is large enough for the muon to reach the surface. Express your answer in terms of $E_0$, $b$, $\lambda$, the muon mass $m_\mu$, and the speed of light $c$. Assume the muon's trajectory is nearly vertical.</question>

4.  <question>A simplified model of a laser consists of $N$ two-level atoms confined within a cavity. The atoms can be in either the ground state ($E_1 = 0$) or the excited state ($E_2 = \hbar\omega$). Initially, all atoms are in the ground state. A pump mechanism instantaneously excites $n$ atoms to the excited state, where $n$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\bar{n}$. Assuming that stimulated emission is the dominant process, and the transition rate for stimulated emission is proportional to the number of photons in the cavity, and assuming the photon number can be approximated as a continuous variable for large photon number, find an expression for the probability distribution of the number of photons in the cavity after a long time.</question>

5.  <question>A spherical object with radius $r$ is orbiting a distant star at a distance $d$. The star has a radius $R$ and a surface temperature $T_s$. Assume that the object's orbit is much larger than both the object's radius and the star radius, so that the object subtends a small solid angle as seen from the star, and vice versa. Due to imperfect knowledge of the object's albedo, its emissivity, $\epsilon$, is known only to lie within a range $[\epsilon_0 - \delta, \epsilon_0 + \delta]$, where $\delta \ll \epsilon_0$. Determine an expression for the equilibrium temperature of the object, $T_{eq}(\epsilon)$, in terms of $r$, $R$, $T_s$, $d$, $\epsilon_0$, $\delta$, and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant $\sigma_{SB}$.</question>
