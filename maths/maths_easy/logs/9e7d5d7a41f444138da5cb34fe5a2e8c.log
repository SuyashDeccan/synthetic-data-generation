</question>
=== Turn 0: Critic feedback ===
Here is a detailed critique of your questions according to the criteria provided:

---

### Q1: Cyclotomic Field and Galois Automorphism

**Strengths:**  
- Clear setup, precise field and automorphism.
- Well posed, asks for a specific order (single value).

**Improvements:**  
- The phrase "the automorphism $\sigma$ defined by $\sigma(\zeta_7)=\zeta_7^3$" is repeated; consider simplifying wording.
- Mention explicitly that the answer should be a single integer in LaTeX format.

---

### Q2: Real Closed Field, Extension, Norm, Minimal Polynomial

**Strengths:**  
- Good logical setup, context is specific, asks for a clearly defined object (minimal polynomial).

**Improvements:**  
- Avoid including both the definition of $E$ ($F(i)$) and $i$ with $i^2=-1$; it's enough to define $E=F(i)$.
- Make it explicit that the minimal polynomial to be given is as a monic polynomial in $F[x]$ with variable $\alpha$ only.
- Only allow $\alpha \ne 1$, but "minimal polynomial of $\alpha$" is ambiguous if there are many such $\alpha$—perhaps specify that "Find the minimal polynomial over $F$ of such an $\alpha \ne 1$."

---

### Q3: Splitting Field, Automorphisms, Mapping Root to Conjugate

**Strengths:**  
- Set-up is precise, question is original.

**Improvements:**  
- The phrase "that send a root $\alpha$ of $f$ to another conjugate root" could be rephrased for clarity. Since all automorphisms permute roots among conjugates, specify:  
  "Determine the number of distinct automorphisms in $\mathrm{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$ that map one root $\alpha$ to another (distinct) root."
- State the form of the answer (i.e., explicitly as an integer).

---

### Q4: Field Extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$ and Automorphism Group

**Strengths:**  
- Good direct question about automorphism group; expects symbolic mapping.

**Improvements:**  
- The phrase "specifying the image of $\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{3}$ under each automorphism" almost makes this multi-part. Instead, say:  
  "List all automorphisms in $\mathrm{Aut}(L/\mathbb{Q})$ by specifying the images of $\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{3}$ under each automorphism."
  Ensure answer expected is a table or listing; clarify that this constitutes a single answer.

---

### Q5: Minimal Polynomial for a Conjugate, Sum of Conjugates

**Weaknesses:**  
- Asks for "minimal polynomial of $\beta$" and "sum of conjugates", i.e., two things—**violates single-output rule (#10).**

**Improvements:**  
- **Split into two separate questions.** For example:  
   - "Write the minimal polynomial of $\beta$ in terms of $\beta$."  
   - OR "Express the sum of the conjugates of $\alpha$ using the coefficients of $x^3-3x+1$."
  Each should be its own question.

---

### Q6: Constructible Number Degree

**Strengths:**  
- Context is precise (constructibility, algebraic degree).
- Question is well-posed (asks for possible degrees).

**Improvements:**  
- Request output as a set in LaTeX, e.g., "$\{1,2,4,8\}$" or similar.
- The phrase "identify the possible degrees..." could be tightened to:
  "List all possible degrees of the minimal polynomial of $\theta$ over $\mathbb{Q}$."

---

### Q7: Galois Extension, Infinite Cyclic Group, Degree of $\alpha$

**Weaknesses:**  
- The assumption "$K/\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois with infinite cyclic Galois group" is not possible—no such $K/\mathbb{Q}$ exists (over $\mathbb{Q}$ all Galois extensions are of finite degree).

**Improvements:**  
- **Replace with a scenario in which the Galois group is infinite over an appropriate base field, if non-finite extensions are allowed, or clarify that $G$ is finite.**  
  Otherwise, this scenario can be considered invalid for the given context.

---

### Q8: Norm of Primitive Fifth Root of 2 in Splitting Field

**Strengths:**  
- Setup is clear, concise, and the task is specific.

**Improvements:**  
- None; this is a good question.

---

### Q9: $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ Automorphism, Image of $\beta$

**Strengths:**  
- Setup and target well-defined, requires some computation.

**Improvements:**  
- Use consistent notation for automorphisms. State that $\sigma$ sends $\sqrt{2}$ to $-\sqrt{2}$.

---

### Q10: Degree of Minimal Polynomial of $\alpha + \alpha^{-1}$

**Strengths:**  
- Setup is concise, and the question is unique.

**Improvements:**  
- Phrase: "Compute the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\alpha+\alpha^{-1}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$" is good. Specify that the answer should be an integer in LaTeX.

---

## General Suggestions

- **Avoid multiple outputs per question.**
- **Always specify the form of the answer** (integer, polynomial, set, etc.) for clarity.
- **Prefer unique situations** not directly pulled from undergraduate examples.
- **Ensure all questions are feasible/resolvable** with standard theory.
- **Use concise wording** and standard notation, especially for automorphism actions.

**Summary of Corrections:**
- Q5: Split into two separate questions.
- Q7: Invalid scenario (infinite Galois group over $\mathbb{Q}$); needs revision.
- In other cases, minor wording and output clarification improvements.

**Action Items:**  
- Revise Q5 and Q7 as above.
- Tweak remaining questions for output specification and clarity.
- Recheck that each question has only one required answer, no more.

=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
**General evaluation:**  
Most of your questions are well-structured and adhere strongly to your criteria. They typically feature a precise mathematical setup (often in algebraic number theory or field theory), provide all necessary information, and request a single, symbolic answer. Here is question-by-question feedback aligned to your guidelines:

---

**Question 1 (Cyclotomic field automorphism order):**  
- **Strengths:** Clear, unambiguous setup; asks for a single integer; all info provided.
- **Improvements:** None necessary.

---

**Question 2 (Minimal polynomial in extension $F(i)$):**  
- **Strengths:** Specific scenario in field theory; symbolically precise target.
- **Improvements:**  
  - The condition "$\alpha \neq 1$" could be replaced with "$\alpha \neq \pm 1$" if necessary (since multiple elements can have norm 1), but as is, it's fine if this is the intent.

---

**Question 3 (Automorphisms mapping a root):**  
- **Strengths:** Focused, concise, precise setup.
- **Improvements:**  
  - If the splitting field degree is not standard knowledge, specify (or lead to) the degree within the question itself for clarity.
  - Consider clarifying if "distinct automorphisms" refers to automorphisms acting nontrivially on the root, as written, for absolute clarity.

---

**Question 4 (Automorphisms of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})$):**  
- **Strengths:** Concrete and symbolic; specific output required.
- **Improvements:**  
  - The instruction to "list all elements" and "provide the total number" could be streamlined: "List all automorphisms $\sigma$ of $L$ fixing $\mathbb{Q}$ by specifying $\sigma(\sqrt{2})$ and $\sigma(\sqrt{3})$, and state the total number of distinct automorphisms." This helps condense information.

---

**Question 5 (Minimal polynomial of a conjugate):**  
- **Strengths:** Rigorous, direct, correct abstraction.
- **Improvements:**  
  - Potential redundancy: The minimal polynomial for any conjugate is the same as that of $\alpha$—does this truly require non-standard reasoning?
  - The prompt could be clearer if you specify: "Write the minimal polynomial in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ satisfied by any conjugate $\beta$ (other than $\alpha$) of $\alpha$."

---

**Question 6 (Sum of conjugates):**  
- **Strengths:** Specific, single explicit symbolic answer.
- **Improvements:**  
  - None. Very well-posed.

---

**Question 7 (Possible minimal polynomial degrees for constructible numbers):**  
- **Strengths:** Satisfies the constructibility conditions succinctly.
- **Improvements:**  
  - You could clarify "list all possible degrees $n$ such that the minimal polynomial of $\theta$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ may have degree $n$".

---

**Question 8 (Norm in a splitting field of $x^5-2$):**  
- **Strengths:** Concrete, non-trivial multi-step reasoning; clear target.
- **Improvements:**  
  - None necessary.

---

**Question 9 (Automorphism and computation in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$):**  
- **Strengths:** Precise computation from automorphism definition.
- **Improvements:**  
  - Might specify: "Compute $\sigma(\beta)$, expressing your answer in the form $a + b\sqrt{2}$ with $a,b \in \mathbb{Q}$."

---

**Question 10 (Minimal polynomial degree for $\alpha + \alpha^{-1}$):**  
- **Strengths:** Well-posed, advanced, unique (not standard in textbooks).
- **Improvements:**  
  - None; question is concise and precise.

---

**Summary of improvement points:**

1. **Clarity in outputs:** For outputs involving a table or list (e.g., automorphism images), be explicit about the format required (especially for automated assessment).
2. **Potential redundancy:** For questions whose answer is identical to the “input” (e.g., same minimal polynomial for conjugates of a root), clarify if there is something more being expected.
3. **Degree/context hints:** For polynomials whose splitting field degree may not be instantly clear, a brief note/hint could be helpful for rigor and fairness (unless advanced field knowledge is assumed).
4. **Minimize minor ambiguities:** Rephrase constraints/conditions for maximal unambiguity, especially where multiple logical interpretations are possible.

**Overall:**  
The set is highly rigorous and very close to ideal for advanced, proof-free symbolic mathematics assessment. Most suggested changes are minor, aimed at clarity or explicitness for the reader or grader.
