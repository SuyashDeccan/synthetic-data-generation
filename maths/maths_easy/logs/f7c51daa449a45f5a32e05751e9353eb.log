=== Turn 0: Critic feedback ===
Below is detailed, actionable feedback on each question, referencing your rubric:

---

### 1. Flux through paraboloid
**Evaluation**:  
- Meets input format, structure, target, and output criteria.
- Requests a clearly defined symbolic answer.
- Requires multi-step work (parameterization, surface integral, computation).
- Original and non-trivial, not just a reworded standard exercise.

**Improvement**:  
**No major changes needed.** This is an exemplary surface integral problem.

---

### 2. Directional derivative along a curve
**Evaluation**:  
- Setup is clear: function, point, curve, and evaluation location.
- Multi-step: gradient, tangent vector, normalization, etc.
- Original (direction is along tangent to specific curve).
- Unambiguous single output.

**Improvement**:  
- Consider clarifying "direction tangent" by explicitly stating "unit tangent vector to $\mathbf{r}(t)$ at $t=1$".
- Consider explicitly stating "compute the directional derivative of $f$ in the direction of the unit tangent vector..." to preempt ambiguity.

---

### 3. Flux through parameterized surface
**Evaluation**:  
- Surface and field are precisely defined.
- Output is single flux value.
- Multi-step: parameterization, normal vector, integration.

**Improvement**:  
- "Outward normal" could be ambiguous. For parameterizations, clarify orientation: "Take the normal corresponding to increasing $u$ and $v$ such that the orientation is outward from the surface."
- Optionally, specify the orientation in terms of which side (outside the paraboloid surface).

---

### 4. Limit and continuity
**Evaluation**:  
- Asks two things: limit and continuity.
- Slightly violates "single output" rule (question #10).
- Otherwise, mathematically clear and multi-step.

**Improvement**:  
**Change to only require limit** OR only ask about continuity at the origin (since that depends on the limit):  
> "Evaluate $\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)} \frac{x^3 y}{x^2+y^2}$."  
*or*
> "Determine whether $f$ is continuous at the origin."  
But do not ask both in one item.

---

### 5. Flux through planar region in first octant
**Evaluation**:  
- Vector field and surface are precisely defined.
- "Unit normal pointing outward from the origin" is clear for standard orientation.
- Single symbolic answer expected.

**Improvement**:  
- *Optional*: Specify the region explicitly as $x\geq0$, $y\geq0$, $z\geq0$ so there's no ambiguity about the "first octant".

---

### 6. Time derivative along a curve
**Evaluation**:  
- Curve and scalar field are clearly defined.
- Target value at given $t$ is unambiguous.
- Single output.
- Multi-step: chain rule for multivariable function along a curve.

**Improvement**:  
- The dollar sign after $t^2)$ in the question is a typo, remove the extra $.  
- To be clearer: "Compute $\frac{d}{dt} g(\mathbf{r}(t))$ at $t=0$."

---

### 7. Tangent plane to level surface
**Evaluation**:  
- Well-posed, unambiguous.
- Multi-step.
- Target answer is a single equation.

**Improvement**:  
- None necessary: textbook direct, but can be considered minimally original.

---

### 8. Divergence theorem on sphere
**Evaluation**:  
- Vector field and surface specified exactly.
- Use of divergence theorem is explicitly called for.
- Output strictly single number.

**Improvement**:  
- None needed.

---

### 9. Second mixed partial derivative
**Evaluation**:  
- Function and evaluation point are clear.
- Only asks for one partial.

**Improvement**:  
- None needed.

---

### 10. Surface area element on hemisphere
**Evaluation**:  
- Asks for dS in spherical coordinates on upper hemisphere.
- Clear bounds, single output expected.

**Improvement**:  
- None needed.

---

### **General Feedback**
- Be careful that each question asks for exactly one answer (no multipart queriesâ€”see #4).
- When specifying surface orientations, in parameterized surfaces, explicitly state the orientation relative to the parameterization, not just "outward" (see #3).
- Avoid stray or mismatched LaTeX delimiters (see #6).

**Overall**, your questions are largely compliant and high-quality. Most improvements are minor clarifications or ways to reduce small ambiguities. The main actionable fix is to ensure questions never have multiple distinct tasks (as in #4).

=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here is a critique of your questions, evaluated against your stated guidelines:

---

### Question 1  
**Strengths**:  
- Clear mathematical setup with all necessary definitions.
- Target is a single symbolic/numerical result (flux).
- Requires multi-step reasoning (surface parameterization, flux calculation).

**Improvements**:  
- The question matches the structure of common textbook questions (Guideline 6: Originality). Consider altering the vector field or surface, or combining concepts to enhance originality.

---

### Question 2  
**Strengths**:  
- Well-posed mathematical structure.
- Single, unambiguous output is required.
- Involves chained application of gradient and directional derivative.

**Improvements**:  
- This is a standard application problem; to boost originality, select a less common curve or function.

---

### Question 3  
**Strengths**:  
- All relevant information is present.
- Requires parameterization, normal vector, and surface integral.
- Unambiguous, single output.

**Improvements**:  
- Like question 1, it's based on typical exam problems. Try to introduce a twist (e.g., different orientation, or more creative region).

---

### Question 4  
**Strengths**:  
- Concise, relevant, single-output limit.
- All information given.

**Improvements**:  
- The function is a common example for non-existence of multivariable limits. To improve originality, choose a less canonical expression.

---

### Question 5  
**Strengths**:  
- Mathematical structure is well defined.
- Single clear target (flux through a planar region).
- Clear description for the orientation.

**Improvements**:  
- The vector field and surface are directly from standard texts. Choose less common surfaces or vector fields.

---

### Question 6  
**Strengths**:  
- Properly defines curve and scalar field.
- Target is single directional derivative.

**Improvements**:  
- Standard format; for originality, change the function or the curve to make the question less textbook-like.

---

### Question 7  
**Strengths**:  
- Clear layout: function, level surface, and point are given.
- Asks for a single equation (tangent plane).

**Improvements**:  
- This is a very standard question; consider a more involved surface or less trivial point.

---

### Question 8  
**Strengths**:  
- Fully specified vector field and surface.
- Explicitly requests use of divergence theorem (multi-step).
- Single, symbolic answer.

**Improvements**:  
- The vector field is a bit too straightforward for divergence theorem; try constructing a field that makes the computation less standard.

---

### Question 9  
**Strengths**:  
- All aspects are specified.
- Clearly asks for a single partial derivative at a point.

**Improvements**:  
- Very similar to many textbook examples; modify either $h(x, y)$ or the evaluation point for more originality.

---

### Question 10  
**Strengths**:  
- Defines both parameterization ranges and mathematical surface.
- Clearly asks for a single symbolic expression for $dS$.

**Improvements**:  
- This is a typical surface parameterization/computation exercise. Adjust the surface shape or coordinate system for more originality.

---

### General Feedback  
- **Input Format**: All questions satisfy fully text-based criteria.
- **Mathematical Structure & Solvable Target**: All have full setups with single, unambiguous answers.
- **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Each requires chaining definitions/theorems.
- **Conciseness & Relevance**: No redundant or irrelevant information.
- **Originality**: Most questions closely resemble standard textbook or exam problems. Strive for more creative, less predictable setups (novel surfaces, less common fields, unique domain ranges).
- **Single Output**: All satisfy.
- **Solution Format**: Not applicable, as no solutions are given.
- **Language & Notation**: Rigorous and standard.

---

### **Summary of Actionable Suggestions**
1. **Increase originality:** For each problem, use less conventional functions, fields, or surfaces, or combine concepts for novelty.
2. **Avoid overused templates:** Move away from strictly classic examples seen in multivariable calculus texts.
3. **Maintain single-solution focus:** You do this well; continue not to include parts or multiple answers.
4. **Continue using clear, unambiguous notation and instructions.**

Overall, your questions are properly formatted and mathematically solid, but lack in originality; this is the primary area to improve.
