---

**Q1: Heat equation eigenvalue**  
- **Strengths:** Clear mathematical setup, correct use of LaTeX, single symbolic output, all information provided.

=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Certainly! Here is concise, actionable feedback for improving the set of questions based on your guidelines:

---

**General Positive Notes:**
- All questions are fully text-based, appropriately formatted in LaTeX, and do not refer to diagrams or external media.
- Each question requests a single, explicit symbolic or closed-form answer (no proofs required).
- The mathematical setup is clear, relevant, and concise in nearly all cases.
- Symbolic notation and equation formatting are consistent and professional.
- Each problem requires multi-step reasoning.
- No question is divided into explicit multiple subparts.

---

**Question-by-Question Critique:**

1. **Heat Equation Eigenvalue Problem**
   - **Strengths:** Clear setup, standard boundary and initial conditions, asks for a specific symbolic answer.
   - **Improvements:** Consider noting that the initial condition motivates the eigenvalue—otherwise, the “smallest positive eigenvalue” is independent of initial data. To enhance originality (Guideline 6), connect the eigenvalue directly to properties of the initial state or specify a twist not found in standard textbooks.

2. **Legendre Equation Eigenvalue (Degree 3)**
   - **Strengths:** Well-posed, specifically asks for the eigenvalue corresponding to degree 3 solutions, setup is compact and clear.
   - **Improvements:** None required—this is a clear and original question.

3. **Burgers'-type Nonlinear PDE (Method of Characteristics)**
   - **Strengths:** All details provided, requests an explicit (symbolic/implicit) solution form, not just the method.
   - **Improvements:** State “Find an implicit formula relating $u$, $x$, and $t$” for maximal clarity. Otherwise, very good.

4. **Heat Equation First Eigenfunction Coefficient**
   - **Strengths:** Clearly asks for a single coefficient, with a well-defined initial function. Directs the answer to a specific eigenfunction.
   - **Improvements:** Consider stating explicitly which eigenfunction (e.g., $n=1$) to avoid ambiguity.

5. **Sturm-Liouville with Weighted $w(x)$**
   - **Strengths:** Well-posed, original due to weight $x$, asks for eigenvalue in terms of Bessel zeros.
   - **Improvements:** Clarity could be enhanced with “Express $\lambda_1$ using the first positive zero of the appropriate Bessel function”—specify the order so there’s no ambiguity.

6. **Quasilinear PDE, Shock Formation Time**
   - **Strengths:** Asks for explicit symbolic $t_c$, unique problem due to initial data.
   - **Improvements:** Clarify with “Find the smallest positive $t_c$ at which any two characteristics intersect”, to rule out ambiguity.

7. **Linear Advection: FTCS Scheme Stability**
   - **Strengths:** Clearly laid out, asks for explicit inequality on $\mu$.
   - **Improvements:** State “according to the CFL condition for this explicit upwind scheme,” to avoid ambiguity over which scheme is intended.

8. **Bessel Equation Eigenvalue**
   - **Strengths:** Clearly posed, single symbolic answer targeted.
   - **Improvements:** Specify that $j_{0,1}$ is the first positive zero of $J_0(x)$, even though it’s implied.

9. **Heat Equation with Robin/Neumann-Dirichlet Conditions**
   - **Strengths:** Setup is clear, single symbolic eigenvalue explicitly asked for.
   - **Improvements:** Specify the form of the spatial eigenvalue equation to avoid confusion about the boundary conditions.

10. **Nonlinear PDE with $\sin(u)$, Characteristics**
    - **Strengths:** Well-posed, asks for the symbolic relationship.
    - **Improvements:** State that only the implicit “characteristic” solution is needed, to preempt explicit solution attempts that may be impossible.

---

**Additional General Actionable Suggestions:**

- **Originality:** A few problems are standard textbook exercises (e.g., #1, #2, #4, #8). For greater uniqueness, slightly alter coefficients, domains, or initial data, add nontrivial weights, or connect to real-world interpretation.
- **Nonstandard Initial/Boundary Conditions:** Small twists (nonhomogeneous or mixed conditions, piecewise initial data) enhance originality without increasing complexity.
- **Solution Uniqueness:** State specifically “the (smallest/first) positive eigenvalue” or similar clarifiers where multiple solutions could exist.
- **Problem Statement Directness:** For all, begin with “Consider the equation…” and end with “Find/Express/Determine… in terms of $...$”, ensuring focused output.
- **Notational Consistency:** Maintain variable usage (e.g., $k$ always for diffusion, $a$ for advection) to avoid confusion.
- **Redundancy:** Some setups include a little excess (e.g., repeating $t>0$ in every question)—can be streamlined.

---

**Summary:**  
Your questions are mathematically rigorous, formatted professionally, and mostly meet all guidelines. To further improve:  
- Tweak for greater originality beyond standard textbook form.
- Clarify any minor ambiguities about which eigenvalue or coefficient is requested.
- Be direct in what form of solution (explicit/implicit/symbolic) is required.  
- Consider occasionally introducing non-standard data or domains.

Otherwise: Excellent alignment with the provided guidelines.
