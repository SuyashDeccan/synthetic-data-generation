=== Turn 0: Critic feedback ===
Here is an expert critique of each question according to your guidelines, along with actionable feedback.

---

### 1. Euler–Lagrange for $J(u) = \int_0^1 \left(u'(x)^2 + x u(x)^2\right) dx$

**Strengths:**
- Well-defined mathematical setup, in a standard function space.
- Requests a single, unambiguous symbolic answer (the Euler–Lagrange equation).
- Requires multi-step analytic reasoning.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The question currently merges two commands: “determine the Euler–Lagrange equation” and “what is the explicit form…”.
- Slight redundancy: "associated with minimizing $J(u)$" is redundant because it is standard for Euler–Lagrange.

**Actionable edits:**  
**Suggestion:** Remove redundant text and avoid multiple parts.
> *Determine the Euler–Lagrange differential equation satisfied by a function $u(x)$ minimizing $J(u)$ under the boundary conditions $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=1$.*

---

### 2. $L^p$, Nonlinear Functional, Fréchet Derivative

**Strengths:**
- Concrete, rigorous setting.
- Directs to compute an explicit, symbolic expression.
- Requires knowledge of functional analysis and multi-step reasoning.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The phrase “Using the Implicit Function Theorem in finite dimensions” is unnecessary; only the differentiability and derivative matter.
- Slight redundancy: “identify the Fréchet derivative $DF_f$ at a function $f_0 \in X$” and “Express $DF_{f_0}$ explicitly as a bounded linear functional”.

**Actionable edits:**  
**Suggestion:** Remove reference to the Implicit Function Theorem (not relevant to the task).
> *Compute the Fréchet derivative $DF_{f_0}$ of $F$ at an element $f_0 \in L^p([0,1])$ and express it explicitly as a bounded linear functional on $L^p([0,1])$.*

---

### 3. Implicit Function Theorem, solve for $z$

**Strengths:**
- Clear setup.
- Unambiguous symbolic answer expected.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Contains two questions (“apply the theorem to solve for $z$…” and “what is the explicit formula for the derivative…”).
- The first request is vague (“solve for $z$ as a function…”), while only the value of the partial derivative is requested in the second.

**Actionable edits:**  
**Suggestion:** Ask only for the derivative at the point using the theorem.
> *Let $F(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^3 - 3.$ Apply the implicit function theorem to compute $\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}$ at $(x,y,z)=(1,1,1)$, assuming $z$ can be locally written as a function of $x$ and $y$.*

---

### 4. $C([0,1])$, Operator $T(f)(x) = \int_0^x e^{f(t)} dt$, Fréchet Differentiability

**Strengths:**
- Clear function space, operator well-defined.
- Unambiguous symbolic output expected.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Slightly leading: “if so, provide…”—should simply instruct to "determine and provide…"
- Avoids multiple outputs, but the logical structure could be clarified.

**Actionable edits:**  
**Suggestion:** Ask directly for the derivative at zero, assuming differentiability.
> *Compute the Fréchet derivative $DT_0: C([0,1]) \to C([0,1])$ of $T$ at the zero function.*

---

### 5. $W^{1,2}$, Euler–Lagrange for $J(u)$ with $u(0)=u(1)=0$

**Strengths:**
- Explicit, well-posed problem.
- Requests the ODE (unambiguous symbolic output).

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Slightly wordy (“Find the Euler–Lagrange equation … What is the explicit ODE…”).

**Actionable edits:**  
**Suggestion:** Ask for the explicit differential equation for such $u$.
> *Determine the ordinary differential equation satisfied by a minimizer $u$ of $J(u)$ with $u(0) = u(1) = 0$.*

---

### 6. $L^p$, Hölder’s inequality: For which $\alpha$ is $f(x) = x^{-\alpha}$ in $L^p([0,1])$?

**Strengths:**
- Explicit, non-trivial, requires analysis.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The preface about Hölder's inequality and $g$ is unnecessary for the core task.

**Actionable edits:**  
**Suggestion:** Ask only for the range of $\alpha$ for $L^p$ membership.
> *For $1 < p < \infty$, determine all real $\alpha$ for which $f(x) = x^{-\alpha}$ belongs to $L^p([0,1])$.*

---

### 7. $C_{2\pi}(\mathbb{R})$, operator $Lf = f' + \sin(x)f$

**Strengths:**
- Requires analytic reasoning, nontrivial.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The question asks for "the necessary condition on $g$" but does not specify precisely if existence or uniqueness is the focus. The question may not admit a *single* symbolic answer unless the resonance condition for periodic ODEs is cited.

**Actionable edits:**  
**Suggestion:** Be explicit: “Determine the condition on $g$ under which the equation admits a unique solution $f \in C_{2\pi}(\mathbb{R})$.”
> *Identify the necessary and sufficient condition on $g \in C_{2\pi}(\mathbb{R})$ such that the equation $Lf = g$ admits a unique $2\pi$-periodic continuous solution $f$.*

---

### 8. $L^2$ integral equation with $Kf = \int_0^1 \min(x,y) f(y) dy$

**Strengths:**
- Nontrivial, clear operator.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Asks for both a (1) condition on $\lambda$ for invertibility, and (2) an explicit formula for the inverse operator—two tasks.

**Actionable edits:**  
**Suggestion:** Choose either the condition or the explicit inverse—not both.
> *Determine all $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ for which the operator $I - \lambda K$ is invertible on $L^2([0,1])$.*

Or
> *Express the inverse of the operator $K$ on a suitable function space as a differential operator, where $Kf(x) = \int_0^1 \min(x,y) f(y) dy$.*

---

### 9. $F(x,y,z) = e^{xyz} + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 4$, Implicit function theorem for $z(x,y)$

**Strengths:**
- Nontrivial computation, clear symbolic output.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- “Assuming $z$ can be locally written…” is unnecessary (it’s implicit in using the theorem).
- Query is clear and focused on a derived quantity.

**Actionable edits:**  
**Suggestion:** Remove the assumption clause.
> *Use the implicit function theorem to compute $\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}$ for $F(x,y,z) = e^{xyz} + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 4$ at $(x,y,z) = (1,1,1)$.*

---

### 10. $L^2$ functional, $J(f) = \int_0^1 (f(x)^2 + (\int_0^x f(t) dt)^2) dx$

**Strengths:**
- Well-defined, single-step output (Fréchet derivative).
- Nontrivial, unique.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- “Explicitly describing it as an element of the dual space” is redundant; Fréchet derivative means providing the dual action.

**Actionable edits:**  
**Suggestion:** Streamline for clarity.
> *Compute the Fréchet derivative $DJ_f$ of $J$ at $f \in L^2([0,1])$ and express it as an element of $L^2([0,1])^*$.*

---

## General Recommendations

- **Omit extra context or “flavor” not strictly required for the computation.**
- **Make sure each question asks for a single output—ideally, a specific formula.**
- **Where possible, phrase the question in a way that avoids redundancy or part-(a), part-(b) structure.**
- **Use concise, direct language: “Compute…”, “Determine…”, “Find…”**
- **Only introduce function spaces, operators, and constraints directly needed for the task.**
- **Do not provide interpretive, speculative, or puzzle wording.**

Each item above details the necessary amendments for guideline compliance. Your set is strong and well-constructed; only minor refinements are needed for optimal clarity and adherence to your standards.

=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Certainly! Here is a detailed critique of your questions, evaluated against your ten guidelines, with improvement advice for each.

---

### Question 1 (Euler–Lagrange for $J(u)$)

- **Strengths:**  
  - Clear definition of functional and domain/boundary conditions.
  - Requests a specific symbolic result (the differential equation).
  - No redundant or irrelevant content.

- **Issues:**  
  - This is a fairly standard calculus of variations problem (Guideline 6: Originality).  
  - The phrase "differential equation satisfied by a function $u(x)$ minimizing…" could be slightly more direct: "Determine the Euler–Lagrange equation associated with…"

- **Suggestion:**  
  - To improve originality, consider using a less common functional, or a constraint (e.g., an isoperimetric condition).
  - Clarify "satisfied by a function" to "that $u(x)$ must satisfy".

---

### Question 2 (Fréchet derivative of $F(f)$)

- **Strengths:**  
  - Setup is precise, no ambiguity or multi-part output.
  - Input conforms to input/output and formatting rules.
  - Demands multi-step (Fréchet derivative, representation) and clear symbolic output.

- **Issues:**  
  - The phrase "express it explicitly as a bounded linear functional" is mild ambiguity; all Fréchet derivatives are linear functionals, and boundedness follows automatically, so may be redundant.

- **Suggestion:**  
  - Remove "bounded", or simply say "explicitly express as an element of $(L^p([0,1]))^*$".
  - Problem is largely standard; originality could be stronger (perhaps a less typical $F$).

---

### Question 3 (Implicit Function Theorem, $\partial z/\partial x$)

- **Strengths:**  
  - Setup and target are both unambiguous.
  - Multi-step analytic reasoning required.
  - No extraneous details.

- **Issues:**  
  - This is a very standard application of the implicit function theorem (Guideline 6).
  - Phrase "assuming $z$ can be locally expressed…" could be omitted, as it follows by the theorem at regular points.

- **Suggestion:**  
  - Slightly rephrase for concision.
  - For originality, try a less common $F$ or context (e.g., more variables, operator functionals, etc.).

---

### Question 4 (Fréchet derivative of $T$)

- **Strengths:**  
  - Setup is exact; functional is clearly defined.
  - Task clear: Find explicit form of derivative as operator.
  - Good test of understanding of operator derivatives.

- **Issues:**  
  - Fairly standard example; originality issue.
  - "Explicit form as a bounded linear operator" is clear, but could just say "provide its explicit form".

- **Suggestion:**  
  - For greater originality, consider a non-linear operator or parameter dependence.

---

### Question 5 (Euler–Lagrange for quartic $J(u)$)

- **Strengths:**  
  - Straightforward functional; boundary conditions explicit.
  - Requests ODE as output.

- **Issues:**  
  - This is nearly identical in structure to Question 1; strong redundancy.
  - Both are standard textbook calculus of variations problems.

- **Suggestion:**  
  - Remove redundancy: only include one such Euler–Lagrange equation derivation.
  - For more novelty, consider constraints or non-classical functionals.

---

### Question 6 ($L^p$ integrability of $x^{-\alpha}$)

- **Strengths:**  
  - Concise, clear target ("all $\alpha$ such that $f \in L^p$").
  - Multi-step, requires precise inequalities.

- **Issues:**  
  - This is a classic analysis exercise; originality low.
  - Phrasing is appropriate, but possibly overused.

- **Suggestion:**  
  - Consider a more sophisticated test function or different interval.

---

### Question 7 (Uniqueness for $2\pi$-periodic ODE)

- **Strengths:**  
  - Non-trivial operator; appropriate setup.
  - Single output: necessary and sufficient condition for $g$.
  - Demands analysis and not merely solving an equation.

- **Issues:**  
  - Slightly verbose: "$L f = g$ admits a unique… solution" could be shortened.

- **Suggestion:**  
  - For greater originality, use a less standard $L$ or more general periodicity.
  - Specify if $f\in C^1_{2\pi}(\mathbb{R})$ as needed.

---

### Question 8 (Invertibility of $I-\lambda K$)

- **Strengths:**  
  - Operator and question are well-defined.
  - Output is precise (the set of $\lambda$).

- **Issues:**  
  - Standard example of compact operators in $L^2$; originality issue.

- **Suggestion:**  
  - Consider other integral kernels, or by adding a parameter to $K$.

---

### Question 9 (Implicit Function Theorem, $F(x,y,z) = e^{xyz} + \cdots$)

- **Strengths:**  
  - Slightly more original due to nonlinearity.
  - Precise, single output.

- **Issues:**  
  - Structure is similar to Question 3; avoid redundancy.
  - Otherwise meets all criteria.

- **Suggestion:**  
  - Don't have two questions with nearly identical structures. Remove one or introduce greater variety.

---

### Question 10 (Fréchet derivative for $J(f)$ with an integral square term)

- **Strengths:**  
  - Varied, non-trivial functional.
  - Output: derivative as element of dual space, clear symbolic target.
  - Requires multiple analytic steps.

- **Issues:**  
  - None significant; perhaps rephrase the request for the image as "an explicit representative in $L^2([0,1])$".

- **Suggestion:**  
  - Good question; perhaps ask for the Fréchet derivative as a function rather than as an element of the dual.

---

## General Feedback and Action Points

### 1. **Originality**:  
Several questions are very standard (Euler–Lagrange, $L^p$ integrability, standard operator differentiation). To maximize uniqueness, use less common functionals, integral equations, or more advanced contexts.

### 2. **Redundancy**:  
Questions 1 and 5 are structurally identical. Either rework one for novelty or remove to avoid repetition. Similarly, Questions 3 and 9 duplicate the "implicit function theorem for a function $F(x,y,z)$" format.

### 3. **Clarity/Conciseness**:  
Minor tuning in some questions: e.g., "compute the Fréchet derivative… and express it as…" can be made even more direct. Avoid phrases like "assuming $z$ can be locally expressed…" unless ambiguity about regularity exists.

### 4. **Targeted Output**:  
All questions direct the student to a single, well-defined expression. This is good.

### 5. **Formatting**:  
Syntax is (LaTeX-)consistent. Ensure the use of $...$ for inline, $$...$$ for display equations in the final version, as you direct.

### 6. **Complexity/Depth**:  
A few questions (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 6) are at the advanced undergraduate/early graduate level, but could be deepened by adding implicit constraints, more complex operators, or by referencing less familiar contexts/applications.

## **Concrete Steps for Improvement**

1. **Remove redundancy**—don’t include formulaically similar Euler–Lagrange or Implicit Function Theorem problems.
2. **Maximize originality**—avoid textbook classics as much as possible, or merge/swap for more unusual functionals and operators.
3. **Focus on one output, no split parts**—you generally did this well.
4. **Phrase for maximal concision**—minor tweaks for brevity and clarity.
5. **Ensure each problem tests a distinct concept** (operator theory, variational calculus, $L^p$-spaces, etc).

**Sample Revised Problem for Originality**  
> Let $J(u) = \int_0^1 \left(u'(x)^2 + \cos(x)u(x)^4\right) dx$ with $u(0) = 0$, $u(1) = 1$. 
> Derive the Euler–Lagrange differential equation satisfied by any minimizer $u$.
