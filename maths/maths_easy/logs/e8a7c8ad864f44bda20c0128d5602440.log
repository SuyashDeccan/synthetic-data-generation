=== Turn 0: Critic feedback ===
Here is an itemized critique for each question, aligned with your stated guidelines:

---

### Q1 (Polar Rose Petal Interval)
- **Strengths**: Clear context, unique curve, asks for explicit symbolic interval in terms of $\pi$.
- **Issues**:
    - *Potential Multiplicity*: The interval could have multiple valid forms depending on where the petal starts. Specify: "beginning at $\theta=0$" or specify the domain.
    - *Vagueness*: "based on periodicity" is unnecessary; omit to avoid ambiguity.
    - *Guideline #10 Violation*: The phrase "over which this curve completes exactly one full petal" is subtlely ambiguous as it depends on petal starting point.  
- **Recommendation**: 
    - Reword to: "Find the length of the interval in $\theta$, starting at $\theta=0$, over which the curve $r=4\sin(3\theta)$ traces exactly one petal."

---

### Q2 (Reverse Parametrization)
- **Strengths**: Specific vector function, clear request for reparametrization in reverse direction, unique curve.
- **Issues**:
    - *Clarity*: "Starting from the point corresponding to $t=0$" is slightly ambiguous; clarify what "traversed in the reverse direction" means.
    - *Guideline #10 Violation*: The question could be interpreted as requiring both construction and identification of start point.
- **Recommendation**:
    - Edit to: "Give a vector-valued parametrization (as a function of $s$) of the same curve traced in the reverse direction, such that at $s=0$ the position is $\mathbf{r}(0)$."

---

### Q3 (Projection in $\mathbb{R}^3$)
- **Strengths**: Standard vector operation, unambiguous result, unique values.
- **Issues**:
    - *Textbook Problem*: Risks being a direct textbook problem (Guideline #6).
- **Recommendation**:
    - Introduce a less standard vector pair, or require expressing the projection onto a non-parallel vector/combo.
    - As is: Acceptable, but consider making the setup more unique.

---

### Q4 (Trig Equation: $\cos(2x)$)
- **Strengths**: Well-posed, single equation, interval specified, asks for symbolic and particular results.
- **Issues**:
    - *Multiple Parts*: Asks for both general solution and interval-specific values (Guideline #10 violation).
    - *Answer Multiplicity*: "Express the general solution..." + "Then provide the particular solutions..." = two solutions.
- **Recommendation**:
    - Split into: "Solve $2\cos(2x)-\sqrt{3}=0$ for $x\in[0,2\pi)$, expressing your answer using inverse trigonometric functions only."

---

### Q5 (Secant Function Periodicity)
- **Strengths**: Unique function, well-defined answer (period), limited focus.
- **Issues**:
    - *Clear Setup*: Acceptable, but "is defined on the real line" is unnecessary.
- **Recommendation**:
    - Remove superfluous phrase. "Determine the fundamental period of $y=3\sec(2x-\frac{\pi}{4})+1$."

---

### Q6 (Polar Tangent Line)
- **Strengths**: Non-standard polar-to-Cartesian tangent, unique at specified point.
- **Issues**:
    - *Slight Ambiguity*: Could clarify at which point the tangent is required, but already sufficient.
    - *Redundant Symbols*: None.
- **Recommendation**:
    - Acceptable as is; just ensure absence of extraneous detail.

---

### Q7 (Ellipse Phase Shift)
- **Strengths**: Specific parametric ellipse, asks for canonical symbolic answer.
- **Issues**:
    - *Possible Standard Problem*: Phase shift, but otherwise a typical manipulation (Guideline #6).
    - *Redundant Words*: "Construct the parametric equation for the same ellipse corresponding to..." can be simplified.
- **Recommendation**:
    - Reword: "Write the parametric vector equation for the ellipse obtained by phase-shifting $\mathbf{r}(t)=\begin{pmatrix}2\sin t\\3\cos t\end{pmatrix}$ by $\frac{\pi}{3}$ in $t$."

---

### Q8 (Period and Asymptotes for Cotangent)
- **Strengths**: Clear function, period and asymptote focus.
- **Issues**:
    - *Multi-Part Question*: Two outputs requested: both period and list of asymptotes over an interval (Guideline #10 violation).
- **Recommendation**:
    - Split: Either find the period **or** all asymptotes in interval; not both in the same item.

---

### Q9 (Orthogonal Projection in $\mathbb{R}^2$)
- **Strengths**: Interesting twist (onto perpendicular vector), unique vectors.
- **Issues**:
    - *Clarity*: "vector orthogonal to $\mathbf{u}$" is ambiguous; should be "onto a unit vector orthogonal to $\mathbf{u}$" or specify orientation.
    - *Guideline #6*: Not a standard textbook problem, good.
- **Recommendation**:
    - Clarify which orthogonal vector: e.g., "Find the orthogonal projection of $\mathbf{v}$ onto the vector $\mathbf{w}$, where $\mathbf{w}$ is a unit vector orthogonal to $\mathbf{u}$ with positive $x$-component."

---

### Q10 (Trig Equation: $\sin(3x)=\cos(x-\pi/4)$)
- **Strengths**: Interesting equation, expects symbolic result, not standard.
- **Issues**:
    - *Multiplicity*: "Expressing $x$ as a set of formulas ..." is slightly broad. Prefer "all real solutions for $x$ in terms of...".
- **Recommendation**:
    - Reword: "Find all real solutions $x$ to $\sin(3x)=\cos(x-\frac{\pi}{4})$, expressing your answer in terms of inverse trigonometric functions and constants only."

---

## General/Overarching Comments:

- **Multi-Part Violations**: Q4 & Q8 directly violate the "single output" rule; avoid any formulations that ask for both a general and particular solution, or both period and asymptotes.
- **Ambiguity in Starting Points**: For periodic or multi-valued curves, always specify how the interval is chosen (e.g., starting at zero or at the origin); otherwise, answer may not be unique.
- **Colloquial Language**: Avoid phrases like "based on periodicity," "corresponding to," or "construct"—use "determine" or "find" for clarity and conciseness.
- **Redundant Explanatory Phrases**: Remove unnecessary qualifiers like "is defined on the real line" unless meaningful context is added.
- **Unique, Non-trivial Setups**: Most are sufficiently original, but avoid equations or projection problems that directly occur in basic textbooks without variation.

**Actionable Summary**:
- Rephrase all questions to expect only one symbolic output.
- Clarify interval starting points or parameter orientation where relevant.
- Cut out unnecessary wording and split multi-part questions.
- Avoid slight ambiguities in definition (esp. with "reverse direction," "one petal," "orthogonal vector").
- Whenever "express in terms of..." is used, specify variables and the nature of the form expected.

=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Below is a critique of each question according to your guidelines, with focus on improvement suggestions.

---

**Question 1**

*Find the length of the interval in $\theta$, starting at $\theta = 0$, over which the curve defined by $r = 4\sin(3\theta)$ traces exactly one petal. Express your answer in terms of $\pi$.*

- **Strengths**: Concise, uses standard notation, requires algebraic reasoning.
- **Issues**:
    - **Guideline 6**: Finding the interval for "one petal" is a common textbook polar curve question—consider a more original variant (e.g., non-integer $n$ in $r = a\sin(n\theta)$).
    - **Guideline 2**: While well-defined, further clarifying what "traces exactly one petal" means (i.e., no retracing) would help eliminate ambiguity.
- **Action**: Rephrase for more originality; potentially specify "first full traversal of a single distinct non-overlapping petal".

---

**Question 2**

*Given the position vector function $\mathbf{r}(t) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos t + 2t \\ \sin t - t \end{pmatrix},\ t\in\mathbb{R}$, find a vector-valued parametrization $\mathbf{R}(s)$ of the same curve traversed in the reverse direction, such that $\mathbf{R}(0) = \mathbf{r}(0)$.*

- **Strengths**: Well-posed, rigorous, requires symbolic manipulation, provides clear target output.
- **Issues**:
    - **Guideline 6**: This is a standard reverse-parameterization problem; introducing unusual parameterizations, or constraints, would improve originality.
    - **Guideline 10**: There may be more than one valid parametrization; ensure question wording expects exactly one form (e.g., require $s$ be an explicit monotonic function of $t$ such that $s=0$ corresponds to $t=0$, etc.).
- **Action**: Specify the relationship between $s$ and $t$ to avoid multiple correct answers.

---

**Question 3**

*Given vectors $\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 4 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}$, find the vector projection of $\mathbf{a}$ onto $\mathbf{b}$, expressed in simplest vector form.*

- **Strengths**: Clear, well-posed, only essential details, expects vector output.
- **Issues**:
    - **Guideline 6**: Standard projection calculation (textbook), not original.
- **Action**: Use less typical vectors (e.g., with parameters) or pose in the context of an application.

---

**Question 4**

*Solve the equation $2\cos(2x) - \sqrt{3} = 0$ for all $x \in [0, 2\pi)$, expressing your solutions using inverse trigonometric functions only.*

- **Strengths**: Instructs specific form for answer, short and direct.
- **Issues**:
    - **Guideline 7 & 10**: The solution is not unique due to the periodicity, but interval $[0, 2\pi)$ restricts the answer; ensure instruction that all solutions within the given interval are to be given.
    - **Guideline 6**: Common trig equation; can introduce a parameter or context for originality.
- **Action**: Consider making the equation less standard or involving a parameter.

---

**Question 5**

*Determine the fundamental period of the function $y = 3\sec(2x - \frac{\pi}{4}) + 1$.*

- **Strengths**: Concise, structured, expects a single symbolic answer.
- **Issues**:
    - **Guideline 6**: Standard period question; including a less common function or phase shift relationship could enhance originality.
- **Action**: Pose in a less typical form (e.g., include a sum/difference of frequencies).

---

**Question 6**

*A curve is defined in polar coordinates by $r = 5 + 3\cos\theta$. Find the equation of the tangent line to this curve at $\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}$, and express your answer in standard form $Ax+By=C$.*

- **Strengths**: Well-defined, requires multi-step analytic work, precise output form expected.
- **Issues**:
    - **Guideline 6**: Standard tangent-to-limaçon in polar form; could be more original.
- **Action**: Consider a more general polar curve or a parameterized family.

---

**Question 7**

*Given the vector-valued function $\mathbf{r}(t) = \begin{pmatrix} 2\sin t \\ 3\cos t \end{pmatrix}$, $t \in \mathbb{R}$, write the parametric vector equation for the ellipse obtained by applying a phase shift of $\frac{\pi}{3}$ in the parameter $t$. Express your answer in terms of $t$.*

- **Strengths**: Clear, requires analytic reasoning, precise expected result.
- **Issues**:
    - **Guideline 6**: Standard phase shift application; might be improved with an extra twist (e.g., specify a particular initial point, or a transformed ellipse).
- **Action**: Consider asking for a phase-shifted and rotated ellipse, or with an additional parameter.

---

**Question 8**

*Given the function $y = \cot\left(\frac{x}{3} + \frac{\pi}{6}\right)$, find all vertical asymptotes of $y$ in the interval $[0, 6\pi]$.*

- **Strengths**: Well-defined, asks for a symbolic set of values, appropriate interval specified.
- **Issues**:
    - **Guideline 6**: Standard vertical asymptote identification; originality could be improved.
    - **Guideline 10**: Clarify output format (e.g., list or formula).
- **Action**: Specify answer format (an explicit formula or list), and optionally generalize to a more interesting function.

---

**Question 9**

*Let $\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$. Define $\mathbf{w}$ as the unit vector orthogonal to $\mathbf{u}$ with positive $x$-component. Find the orthogonal projection of $\mathbf{v}$ onto $\mathbf{w}$ and express your answer in simplest form.*

- **Strengths**: Requires multiple logical steps, well-defined, clear output, no extraneous info.
- **Issues**:
    - **Guideline 6**: Somewhat standard, but specifying the sign of the $x$-component adds a nice constraint.
- **Action**: Could further generalize or add a small twist for more originality (e.g., projecting onto a $\mathbf{w}$ with another constraint).

---

**Question 10**

*Find all real solutions $x$ to the equation $\sin(3x) = \cos\left(x - \frac{\pi}{4}\right)$, expressing your answer using inverse trigonometric functions and constants only.*

- **Strengths**: Requires several identities and steps, symbolic form required.
- **Issues**:
    - **Guideline 6**: More original than most—uses a non-standard identity; good.
    - **Guideline 10**: Ensure the answer set is unambiguous; specify expected solution form (e.g., in terms of unions or lists if needed).
- **Action**: Specify required output format.

---

**General Suggestions Across All Questions**
- **Originality**: Shift from classic textbook formats toward slightly more inventive contexts or parameterized scenarios.
- **Clarity**: Always specify the required format of the answer (formula, list, set, vector) especially where multiple forms are possible.
- **Ambiguity**: Remove room for multiple interpretations by tightly restricting the solution form, domain, and parameter relationships.
- **Redundancy**: Eliminate unnecessary qualifiers or information, but provide just enough in non-standard cases to prevent confusion.

**Actionable Template for Future Questions**
- Ensure each prompt’s context or parameterization is unique and not a direct rehash of well-known problems.
- Clearly state desired forms and any solution constraints, especially where multiple valid outputs exist.
- Where possible, create multi-step problems that combine two slightly less-standard concepts for greater originality without unnecessary complication.

</question>
=== Turn 2: Critic feedback ===
Here is concise, actionable feedback for each question based on your guidelines:

---

**Q1:** *Polar Petal Interval*

- **Strengths:** Well-defined setup; clear symbolic result; uses non-trivial half-integer frequency.
- **Areas for improvement:** The phrase “starting at $\theta=0$” is ambiguous for curves that may have initial $r=0$. Consider specifying exactly what is meant by “traces one complete petal”—e.g., the interval from when it leaves and returns to $r=0$ in the same direction, without retracing any point.
- **Action:** Rephrase for clarity, e.g., “Find the smallest positive interval in $\theta$ for which the curve, beginning at $r=0$, traces exactly one petal without overlap.”

---

**Q2:** *Vector Reverse Direction*

- **Strengths:** Well-defined function; asks for an explicit symbolic answer; clear relationship $t = -s$.
- **Areas for improvement:** The “reverse direction” plus “$\mathbf{R}(0)=\mathbf{r}(0)$” is slightly ambiguous since reversal with linear relation may not preserve initial point. It may confuse whether to apply a translation or simply the parameter substitution.
- **Action:** Explicitly clarify what is meant by “reverse direction” and ensure that the initial condition is compatible with the parameter relation.

---

**Q3:** *Vector Projection for $k=2$*

- **Strengths:** Clear, focused question; defines all symbols; straightforward vector algebra.
- **Areas for improvement:** The “for $k=2$” part could be put before the vector definition to declutter.
- **Action:** Move “for $k=2$” before the first vector, or state “Let $\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$”.

---

**Q4:** *Trig Equation for $x$*

- **Strengths:** Direct, concrete symbolic answer required; exact form requested.
- **Areas for improvement:** The phrase “explicitly as a list in terms of…” could be replaced by standard set notation—e.g., “List all $x$ in $[0,2\pi)$ that…”.
- **Action:** Phrase as: “Find all $x\in[0,2\pi)$ satisfying…”

---

**Q5:** *Secant Period*

- **Strengths:** Clear functional form; asks for symbolic period.
- **Areas for improvement:** “Justify briefly…” violates the single-output rule. The answer should be the period only.
- **Action:** Remove justification request.

---

**Q6:** *Tangent to Polar Curve*

- **Strengths:** Non-trivial polar form; clear symbolic answer required in standard form.
- **Areas for improvement:** The standard form specification is fine, but “with integer coefficients where possible” introduces ambiguity (is simplification required even if impossible?). Also, the phrase is superfluous.
- **Action:** Drop “where possible” to be unambiguous.

---

**Q7:** *Ellipse Phase Shift Rotation*

- **Strengths:** Clear transformation sequence; expects explicit symbolic parametric answer.
- **Areas for improvement:** Ensure that the “phase shift in $t$” and “rotation of $45^\circ$” is unambiguously ordered (first phase shift, then rotation).
- **Action:** Make the sequence explicit: “First apply the phase shift, then the rotation.”

---

**Q8:** *Cotangent Asymptotes*

- **Strengths:** Explicit symbolic answer as a list; domain well specified.
- **Areas for improvement:** “Express your answer as a list” is fine, but “all vertical asymptotes” could be replaced by “Find all $x$ in $[0,6\pi]$ for which $y$ is undefined.”
- **Action:** Phrase as “Find all $x$ in $[0,6\pi]$ for which $y$ is undefined.”

---

**Q9:** *Unit Vector and Projection*

- **Strengths:** Multi-step reasoning required; clear symbolic answer requested.
- **Areas for improvement:** The definition of “orthogonal to $\mathbf{u}$ with positive $x$-component” is good, but could phrase as “unit vector perpendicular to $\mathbf{u}$, with positive $x$-component”.
- **Action:** Minor wording tweak as above for technical clarity.

---

**Q10:** *Trig Equation Inverse Form Solution*

- **Strengths:** Explicit symbolic form, all solution branches; expects set notation.
- **Areas for improvement:** The prompt is slightly long and “present your answers as unions of sets” could be simplified.
- **Action:** Strike “present your answers…” and simply say “List all real $x$ that satisfy the equation in terms of...” to reduce wordiness.

---

**General recommendations:**
- Remove any secondary requirements (such as explanations or justifications).
- Always use set/list notation for solutions, specify desired form (e.g., in terms of $\pi$, exact, not decimal approximations).
- Make output expectations explicit: “List all $x$…”, “Express your answer as…”, etc., in concise language.
