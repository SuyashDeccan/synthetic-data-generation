A pharmaceutical company tests a new drug on 10 patients, measuring their blood pressure before and after treatment. Let the differences in blood pressure (before minus after) be recorded as $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_{10}$. Using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test at a significance level of $\alpha=0.05$, determine the critical value for the test statistic to decide whether the drug has a statistically significant effect on blood pressure.

</question>
=== Turn 0: Critic feedback ===
Here is a concise critique of each question with clear, actionable feedback according to your guidelines:

---

**Question 1 (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank critical value):**  
- **Issue:** The prompt requests a lookup (critical value) instead of a process or a symbolic/numeric calculation. It does not require algebraic manipulation or multi-step reasoning.
- **Action:** Ask for calculation or symbolic decision rule involving the test statistic, not look-up of a table value. For example, "Express the decision rule for this Wilcoxon test in terms of $T$ and/or $T^+$ for $n=10$."

---

**Question 2 (Friedman Test hypotheses and degrees of freedom):**  
- **Issue:** Asks for two things (hypotheses and df)—violates the single output rule. Hypotheses formulation is semi-verbal and not a unique symbolic answer; degrees of freedom is a secondary question.
- **Action:** Revise to require a single output: e.g., "Express the degrees of freedom for the Friedman test in this scenario."

---

**Question 3 (Kruskal-Wallis formula):**  
- **Issue:** Well-structured, requires symbolic formula in terms of variables. However, this is a standard textbook question and lacks originality.
- **Action:** Add a twist for originality (e.g., introduce tied ranks or require a correction), or frame it so the formula is applied to a specific context, not just recited.

---

**Question 4 (Friedman critical value):**  
- **Issue:** Asks for critical value (lookup)—numeric decision based on a table, not a numeric calculation or formula. No multi-step reasoning.
- **Action:** Ask instead for an expression for the rejection region or the value of the test statistic that should be compared, or for the degrees of freedom for the relevant chi-square distribution.

---

**Question 5 (Wilcoxon T+ and decision rule):**  
- **Issue:** Two tasks (null hypothesis, expression/decision rule), violating single output. Hypotheses are verbal, not symbolic. Decision rule verges on table lookup, not requiring calculation.
- **Action:** Require only the symbolic expression of the decision rule in terms of $T^+$ and $n=8$, or only write the null hypothesis in correct notation.

---

**Question 6 (Kruskal-Wallis direct calculation):**  
- **Issue:** This requires plugging into the formula, which is good, but since only the formula is substituted with values, and the answer just rewrites the formula with numbers, there's little algebraic manipulation or step-by-step reasoning.
- **Action:** Ask for a symbolic expression *and* the fully simplified numerical value as a single output.

---

**Question 7 (Wilcoxon, critical value for $n=9$):**  
- **Issue:** Asks for a decision based on table (i.e., "determine whether $H_0$ is rejected..."). Requires table lookup, insufficient multi-step reasoning, and not a unique symbolic/numeric answer.
- **Action:** Ask for the symbolic decision rule, or what the rejection region is in terms of $T$ for $n=9$ at $\alpha=0.05$.

---

**Question 8 (Friedman formula with tie correction):**  
- **Issue:** Two outputs (formula and degrees of freedom), violating the guideline. Formula with tie correction is good, but asking for degrees of freedom is another output.
- **Action:** Choose one: require only the tie-corrected formula, or only the degrees of freedom.

---

**Question 9 (Wilcoxon $n=7$, decision):**  
- **Issue:** Requires multiple outputs (hypotheses, decision rule, conclusion), violating the "single output" rule. Conclusion is a yes/no, not an algebraic or symbolic answer.
- **Action:** Specify either the hypotheses (symbolically), or the decision rule, or require just the rejection region in terms of $T$ for the given $\alpha$.

---

**Question 10 (Kruskal-Wallis reject/non-reject):**  
- **Issue:** Asks for the null hypothesis plus a decision based on comparison to a table value, and the decision is not a symbolic/numeric answer.
- **Action:** Require only the symbolic formulation of the null hypothesis, or only the critical value for $H$ at the given degrees of freedom and $\alpha$.

---

### **General Recommendations**
- Each question should require *one* well-posed symbolic or numeric answer.
- Avoid table lookups or yes/no decisions based solely on tables.
- Ask for expressions, specific computations, or symbolic results involving the main variables.
- Avoid multiple parts or multi-output requests (hypotheses + something else).
- For more originality, include small variations (e.g., data ties, corrected statistics, express in terms of arbitrarily named variables).
- Focus on algebraic manipulation, logical sequence, or calculation based on given scenarios, not recall or pure hypothesis writing.

---

### **Example of Improved Question Based on Guidelines**
Given $n=10$ paired differences in a Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test, express the range of values for the test statistic $T$ that would lead to rejection of the null hypothesis at the significance level $\alpha = 0.05$.

</question>
=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Certainly! Here is concise, actionable feedback for each question evaluated against your specified guidelines:

---

**Question 1**  
*Issue:* Asks for a “range” (set) of $T^+$ values for rejection, but does not specify a direction or hypothesis (one-sided or two-sided). No concrete critical value or logical inequality to write.  
*Improvement:* Ask explicitly for the symbolic inequality involving $T^+$ and $T_{\text{crit}}$ for rejection, and state one-sided or two-sided context.

---

**Question 2**  
*Issue:* The degrees of freedom in the Friedman test are straightforward, making this too trivial. No multi-step reasoning or computation is required.  
*Improvement:* Pose a question requiring the derivation or calculation based on variables, or ask for a symbolic function in terms of $k$.

---

**Question 3**  
*Issue:* Well-structured, but “write the formula” is trivial and may simply copy a textbook formula.  
*Improvement:* Require derivation, simplification for these $n_i$ and $R_i$, or specify all variables to ensure a closed expression.

---

**Question 4**  
*Issue:* Redundant wording (“provide the inequality involving Q and the chi-square...”). Essentially just states the definition of the rejection region.  
*Improvement:* Frame as "Express the rejection region for $Q$ using the critical value $\chi^2_{(k-1),\,\alpha}$" and avoid redundancy.

---

**Question 5**  
*Issue:* The first sentence ("express $T$ in terms of $T^+$") and the second ("state the symbolic form of the decision rule...") are two separate tasks—violates "single output" policy.  
*Improvement:* Only ask for the symbolic inequality for rejection in terms of $T^+$ and $T_{\text{crit}}$.

---

**Question 6**  
*Issue:* Fully quantitative, matches guidelines. However, for more depth, you might require the symbolic expression first, then a numeric value (which would be two parts, so avoid).  
*Improvement:* As is, it is acceptable, but do not instruct for both symbolic and numeric unless explicitly needed for logic.

---

**Question 7**  
*Issue:* Redundant with prior Wilcoxon question; asks for region “in terms of its critical values” (restating the method).  
*Improvement:* Frame as “State the symbolic inequality involving $T$ and $T_{\text{crit}}$ that defines the rejection region at $\alpha=0.05$.”

---

**Question 8**  
*Issue:* Good symbolic structure, clear variables, and a unique element (tie correction), but “incorporating a tie correction factor $C$” is a bit vague.  
*Improvement:* Clearly define $C$ as the standard tie correction factor in the Kruskal-Wallis context for full rigor.

---

**Question 9**  
*Issue:* Asks for both the null hypothesis and the rejection region—two outputs in one question.  
*Improvement:* Only ask for *one* of these, preferably the symbolic null hypothesis (or the rejection region).

---

**Question 10**  
*Issue:* Asks for two outputs: symbolic null hypothesis and degrees of freedom.  
*Improvement:* Ask for just one—preferably “state the degrees of freedom symbolically.”

---

**General Summary of Improvements:**

- Always require a *single* answer per question (no double-barreled queries).
- Specify *symbolic* (not ambiguous “range” or “region”; use clear inequalities).
- Avoid trivial “write the formula” or “state the degrees of freedom” unless combined with a twist (e.g., require derivation, or parameterization).
- Provide all information needed to state clear, non-redundant symbolic answers.
- Minimize repetitive test-statistic region questions—vigorously vary structure and required algebraic manipulation.
- Define all symbols and context for rigorous clarity (e.g., tie correction factor).
- Do not conflate “decision rule” with “statistic definition”—focus on one key concept per question.

---

**Example of improved formulation:**

"Given Wilcoxon signed-rank test statistic $T^+$ with sample size $n=10$ and critical value $T_{\text{crit}}$ at significance level $\alpha=0.05$, express the symbolic rejection region for $T^+$."
