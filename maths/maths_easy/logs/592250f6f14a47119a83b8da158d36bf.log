Here is a critique of your questions according to your guidelines (numbered for reference):

---

**Question 1:** *Normal variable, CDF, solve for $x$.*
- **Strengths:** Well-defined, precise, single output, uses standard notation.
- **Issues:** The setup is standard textbook (Guideline 6). Consider modifying the percentile or the structure to avoid repetition of classic examples.
- **Suggestion:** Contextualize, or modify the probability value sought, or ask for a form not commonly seen in textbooks.

---

**Question 2:** *Poisson PMF at 0, find lambda.*
- **Strengths:** Clear setup and target.
- **Issues:** This is extremely standard (Guideline 6); almost identical to textbook exercises.
- **Suggestion:** Invert the probability, use a less common value, or create a scenario with the same structure but non-trivial context.

---

**Question 3:** *Binomial, equal probabilities for 5 and 7 successes, find $p$.*
- **Strengths:** Requires multi-step reasoning, precise, concise.
- **Issues:** Close to classic identity problems (Guideline 6). Can be improved in originality.
- **Suggestion:** Use less standard symmetric cases, such as asking for matching probabilities for $k$ and $n-k-1$, or similar.

---

**Question 4:** *PMF with variable $a$, CDF at 1 is 1/2, find $a$.*
- **Strengths:** Concise, well-posed.
- **Issues:** Standard setup for small discrete random variables. Could benefit from a less predictable distribution or CDF value.
- **Suggestion:** Make the PMF structure less uniform, or use a different CDF value, or specify $a$ using an expectation or moment.

---

**Question 5:** *Binomial: expected value equals variance, express $p$ in terms of $n$.*
- **Strengths:** Concise, symbolic target, multi-step.
- **Issues:** Highly standard textbook property (Guideline 6).
- **Suggestion:** Use a less common equality, or ask for parameters under an inequality condition.

---

**Question 6:** *Poisson, probability of odd events is 2/3, express equation for lambda.*
- **Strengths:** Excellent originality, multi-step, precise symbolic answer. Satisfies all guidelines.
- **Issues:** None significant.
- **Suggestion:** None; this is a model question.

---

**Question 7:** *Normal PDF values at 1 and 5 are equal, $\mu$ unknown, find $\mu$.*
- **Strengths:** Concise, clear, requires algebraic manipulation, single symbolic answer.
- **Issues:** Classic "equal PDF at symmetric points" setup; slightly standard, but less so than others.
- **Suggestion:** Increase originality with a more asymmetric anchor, or impose another non-standard equality.

---

**Question 8:** *Discrete PMF with geometric structure, normalization constant.*
- **Strengths:** Concise, uses infinite series, single symbolic answer, non-trivial.
- **Issues:** May be standard in infinite PMF normalization.
- **Suggestion:** Consider changing the base from 3 to an expression in $k$, or use a sum that is less immediately recognizable.

---

**Question 9:** *Binomial CDF in terms of regularized incomplete beta function.*
- **Strengths:** Rigorous, advanced, precise symbolic answer.
- **Issues:** Could be framed as "derive" (avoid). Standard for advanced probability, but not trivial.
- **Suggestion:** Instead of "find," use clearer phrasing: "Express $P(X \leq k)$ as..." and avoid the word "derive."

---

**Question 10:** *Normal PDF, verify standardized parameter values, express in standard normal form.*
- **Strengths:** Multi-step, clear symbolic targets, requires understanding of standardization.
- **Issues:** Could force a two-part answer (confirm values, then rewrite PDF), which may violate Guideline 10.
- **Suggestion:** Split into a single required answer: for example, "Express $f_X(x)$ after standardizing the variable."

### Summary Actionable Feedback

1. **Originality (6):** Many questions are highly standard; introduce novel parameter values, contexts, or less common probability distributions/scenarios.

3. **Conciseness (5):** All questions are concise and text-based; this is handled well.
4. **Wording (3, 7):** Avoid words like "derive" or "prove". Use "express", "find", or "calculate".
5. **Formatting (8, 9):** Equations and notation are properly formatted and consistent.
6. **Multi-step reasoning (4):** Reasoning requirement is well balanced.
7. **Standard Problems:** Avoid direct restatements of standard textbook examples. Twist parameters, structures, or contexts to increase uniqueness.

**Overall:** Most questions only need originality improvements and minor clarity adjustments to maximize adherence to the guidelines.

**Overall Assessment:**  
Most questions align well with the guidelines in terms of structure, mathematical rigor, brevity, notation, and expected output. Minor improvements could further optimize clarity, eliminate minor redundancies, and tighten notation or phrasing. Below is question-by-question feedback with suggested improvements.

---

### 1. Normal CDF / Quantile

**Feedback:**  
- Strong mathematical structure and solvable target.
- The introductory phrase "Consider a continuous random variable" is standard.  
- **Suggestions:** The phrase "define the cumulative distribution function..." is nice for clarity, but since $F_X$ is standard, it may not be needed unless you expect audiences who might confuse notation.  
---

### 2. Poisson Parameter from Probability

**Feedback:**  
- Clear, focused, and solvable.
- "**...as a simplified exact expression**" is excellent.
- **Suggestions:** None. Well-constructed.

---

### 3. Binomial—Equating Two Probabilities

**Feedback:**  
- Strong use of contextual clue ("probability of exactly 4 equals probability of exactly 7").
- Clear expected answer format.
- **Suggestions:** None. Well-designed.

---

### 4. Discrete PMF with CDF constraint

**Feedback:**  
- Clear structure, unique form.
- "CDF satisfies $F_W(0.5)=\frac{1}{3}$" is precise.
- **Suggestions:** You could clarify that $F_W(x)=P(W\leq x)$ for completeness, although common conventions make this unnecessary.

---

### 5. Binomial Variance/Mean Relationship

**Feedback:**  
- Well-posed, expects an explicit relationship.
- "Express the condition..." is good.
- **Suggestions:** None.

---

### 6. Poisson—Probability of Odd Number

**Feedback:**  
- Mathematical relationship is well-posed.
- Asks for equation, not for a solved value.
- **Suggestions:** Clear as-is.

---

### 7. Normal PDF—Symmetry Condition

**Feedback:**  
- Satisfies all guidelines.
- Clear single output ($\mu$).
- **Suggestions:** None.

---

### 8. Geometric-like PMF Normalization

**Feedback:**  
- Well-posed and original.
- "as a simplified fraction" is helpful.
- **Suggestions:** None.

---

### 9. Binomial CDF and Beta Function

**Feedback:**  
- Advanced original twist; not just formula recall.
- The phrase "write the formula precisely" is not strictly needed.
- **Suggestions:** Instead, simply say "Express $P(X \leq k)$ in terms of $I_{1-p}(n-k, k+1)$," reducing minor redundancy.

---

### 10. Standardizing a Normal PDF

**Feedback:**  
- Good structure and clarity.
- Last sentence: "specify the values of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ under this standardization."
- **Suggestions:** To further tighten, you might say: "State the standard normal PDF and give the corresponding values of $\mu$ and $\sigma$." The phrase "express $f_X(x)$ in terms of the standard normal distribution $Z$" can be improved: perhaps, "Write $f_X(x)$ explicitly for the standard normal case, and specify the resulting parameter values."

---

## General Recommendations

- **Avoid Redundant Phrases:** Eliminate instructions like "write the formula precisely" or "as a simplified exact expression" when the expected output is unambiguously symbolic.
- **Notation Consistency:** Ensure $P(\cdot)$ versus $f_X(x)$ versus $F_X(x)$ are always defined when first used, but don't over-explain notation common in the context.
- **Clarity of Constraints:** State constraints only as needed (e.g., integer restrictions or positivity).
- **Single Statement:** Favor direct imperative or interrogative forms (e.g., "Find $a$ as a simplified fraction.").

**Summary:**  
Your questions are almost entirely compliant with your guidelines; most improvements are stylistic or about further efficiency of expression. Consider omitting minor instructional phrases and tightening notation for peak clarity. Overall, these are rigorous, concise, and original questions suitable for advanced assessment.
