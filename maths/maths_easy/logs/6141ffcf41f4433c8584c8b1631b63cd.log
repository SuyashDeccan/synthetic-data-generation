</question>
=== Turn 0: Critic feedback ===
Here is concise, actionable feedback on each question, evaluated against your guidelines:

---

**Question 1:**  
*Flux of $\mathbf{F}$ across a paraboloid.*

- **Strengths:**  
  - Clear mathematical setup and target (surface integral of a vector field).
  - All symbols are clearly defined.
  - The question leads to a single symbolic answer.
- **Actionable Improvements:**  
  - No major improvements needed.  
  - If you want to increase originality, consider using a nonstandard vector field or surface.

---

**Question 2:**  
*Partial derivatives of a composite function via parameterization.*

- **Strengths:**  
  - Well-defined setup, non-trivial computation.
  - Clearly states the specific evaluation point.
  - Asks only for the two partial derivatives (well-scoped).
- **Actionable Improvements:**  
  - Clarify that the partials are of the composition $f(\mathbf{r}(u,v))$ with respect to $u, v$ and not $f$ directly — minor notational ambiguity.
  - If you want more challenge, ask for the full vector of derivatives, but this might breach the "single output" rule.

---

**Question 3:**  
*Limit involving vector-valued function and differentiability at $t=0$.*

- **Strengths:**  
  - Well-posed, solution is a symbolic answer.
  - Requires knowledge of Taylor expansion and limits.
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - Asks both for the limit and for a determination regarding differentiability (effectively two outputs).
  - "And determine whether $\mathbf{r}$ is differentiable at $t=0$" is an extra instruction.
- **Actionable Improvements:**  
  - Only ask for the limit; remove the additional clause about differentiability to comply with guideline 10.

---

**Question 4:**  
*Chain rule to compute $\partial z/\partial r$.*

- **Strengths:**  
  - Well-defined, concise, single symbolic target.
  - Clearly specifies all variables and relationships.
- **Actionable Improvements:**  
  - None needed.

---

**Question 5:**  
*2-form integral over upper hemisphere.*

- **Strengths:**  
  - Good use of exterior calculus, original context.
  - Defines everything unambiguously.
- **Actionable Improvements:**  
  - Optionally, clarify what "oriented with outward orientation" means for the hemisphere (it should be standard, but you could state "with the normal pointing out of the sphere for $z \ge 0$").

---

**Question 6:**  
*Limit of scalar function along two paths.*

- **Strengths:**  
  - Tests fundamental multivariate limits.
  - Setup is precise.
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - The question asks for "determine whether the limit exists, and justify ... by evaluating along two different paths"—this is effectively two tasks (show existence *and* show via two paths).
  - The answer may include a discussion, not just a single symbolic value.
- **Actionable Improvements:**  
  - Ask only for the existence or nonexistence of the limit, requesting a specific limiting value or stating "does not exist".  
  - Alternatively, specify just one path, or rephrase as:  
    "Does the limit $\lim_{(x,y)\to (0,0)} f(x,y)$ exist? If so, state its value; if not, provide counterexamples."

---

**Question 7:**  
*Flux through cube using divergence theorem.*

- **Strengths:**  
  - Well-defined, clear target (symbolic flux value), all variables defined.
- **Actionable Improvements:**  
  - None needed.

---

**Question 8:**  
*Area of parameterized surface involving logarithm.*

- **Strengths:**  
  - Well-defined, original parameterization.
  - The question is concise, with a single target.
- **Actionable Improvements:**  
  - None needed.

---

**Question 9:**  
*Flux of $\mathbf{F}$ across a nonstandard surface parameterization.*

- **Strengths:**  
  - Nontrivial, unique setup, clear flux integral.
- **Actionable Improvements:**  
  - None needed.

---

**Question 10:**  
*Total charge inside a sphere with Gaussian density.*

- **Strengths:**  
  - Good use of 3D integration and transformation to closed form.
  - Clearly asks for both the integral setup and the closed-form value.
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - The phrase "express the total charge enclosed within this sphere as an integral and evaluate it in closed form" may be interpreted as a two-part answer (integral form *and* closed-form evaluation).
- **Actionable Improvements:**  
  - Ask directly for the closed-form value, e.g.,  
    "Calculate the total charge enclosed within the sphere of radius $R$, expressing your answer in closed form."

---

### General Feedback:

- **Redundant or Multiple Outputs:**  
  - Several questions implicitly require two outputs (justification plus numeric answer, or limit plus path-checking). Revise so each expects only a single symbolic/numeric output (Guideline 10).
- **Clarity and Conciseness:**  
  - Overall, questions are concise. When asking for an existence result or value, phrase to yield a single unambiguous answer.
- **Originality:**  
  - Most questions are original or at least not standard textbook clones; a few could be made more distinctive by adjusting vector fields or surfaces.
- **Consistency:**  
  - Notation is mostly consistent. Minor suggestion: Ensure explicit clarification of any composition or pushforward when relevant for partial derivatives.
- **Formatting:**  
  - All equations are properly in LaTeX with Markdown syntax.

---

**Summary Recommendations:**  
- For each problem, explicitly require only one type of answer (value, existence, closed-form, etc.).  
- Avoid multi-part questions to comply with your guideline 10.  
- Where multiple steps are needed (e.g., set up and evaluate), phrase so solution is a single symbolic/numeric output.  
- Optionally revise common themes or symmetry to inject more real-world context if seeking further originality.  
- All other aspects (notation, precision, single output, complexity) are appropriate.

=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here is a critique, question by question, following your guidelines:

---

**Question 1:** (Flux of $\mathbf{F}(x,y,z) = (yz, xz, xy)$ across paraboloid)

***Strengths:***
- Clearly defined surface and vector field.
- Setup is mathematically standard but specific.
- Single, unambiguous quantity is requested.

***Suggestions:***
- Problem is nearly standard textbook, could be made more unique by modifying the field or surface.

---

**Question 2:** (Chain rule with parameterized surface)

***Strengths:***
- Setup is clear and requires multi-step application of the chain rule.
- Target is explicit (the two partial derivatives at a given point).
- Originality is above average.

***Suggestions:***
- Since two derivatives are requested, this slightly encroaches on a multiple-parts issue (see guideline 10).
- Best if restricted to a single derivative (e.g., "Compute $\frac{\partial F}{\partial u}$ at ..."), or clarify that both are part of a single natural output.

---

**Question 3:** (Limit involving $\mathbf{r}(t)$)

***Strengths:***
- Well-posed, tests understanding of Taylor expansion for vector functions.
- Clear symbolic target.

***Suggestions:***

---

**Question 4:** (Chain rule, partial of $z$ w.r.t. $r$)

***Strengths:***
- Direct, focused, and single-answer.
- Requires multi-step application of the chain rule.

***Suggestions:***
- Could slightly enhance originality by varying the function $z$.

---

**Question 5:** (Integral of 2-form over hemisphere)

***Strengths:***

***Suggestions:***
- Good as is.

---

**Question 6:** (Limit for $f(x,y)$)

***Strengths:***

- Field could be less archetypal for added originality.

---

**Question 8:** (Surface area of parameterized surface)

***Strengths:***
- Clean, direct, single symbolic answer.

***Suggestions:***
- Good as is.

---

**Question 9:** (Flux of $\mathbf{F}$ over a paraboloid-disk surface)

***Strengths:***
- Surface and domain precisely specified.
- Requires calculation of flux—not just surface area.

***Suggestions:***
- Good, though vector field could be chosen to reduce algebraic complexity without making it trivial.
- Parametrization is clear.

---

**Question 10:** (Total charge for Gaussian density in ball)

***Strengths:***
- Well-posed physical and mathematical setup.
- Closed-form expression required.

### Additional General Feedback

- **Conciseness/Relevance:** All questions are clear, concise, and to the point, with minimal extraneous information. 
- **Notation:** All equations are formatted in LaTeX and easy to read.
- **Single-Output:** Only Question 2 potentially wavers here.
- **Originality:** Several questions are classic and could be spiced up with minor tweaks. Focus on less standard vector fields/functions or less generic surfaces to increase uniqueness.
- **No 'Prove' or 'Show':** All questions comply.
- **No Multiple Parts:** Ensure all answers only require a *single* final symbolic quantity, unless two outputs are obviously inseparable.

---

**Summary of Improvement Suggestions:**
- Make at least some problems more original in field/surface/function.
- For Question 2, either instruct to compute one derivative or clarify that both derivatives at a point are considered a single multi-component answer.
- Double-check that each question only leads to a single unambiguous output.
- Consider reducing algebraic complexity where it doesn't add conceptual depth, especially in flux integrals.
- Avoid classic textbook statements when possible—introduce non-triviality via less common shapes/fields or interesting compositions.
