Input Format: Fully text-based. No diagrams, visual aids, or references to external media. 2. Mathematical Structure: Start with a well-defined setup—real-world or idealized. Avoid vague, puzzle-like, or speculative scenarios. 3. Solvable Target: Ask for a clear symbolic result (e.g., function, limit, closed-form expression). Do not use phrasing like 'Prove' or 'Show that'. 4. Multi-Step Reasoning: Require a logical sequence of algebraic or analytic steps, involving definitions, identities, or theorems. 5. Concise and Relevant: Include only essential information. Eliminate redundant details or irrelevant symbols. 6. Originality: Ensure the problem is unique and non-trivial. Avoid rewording standard textbook problems. 7. Single Output: Expect a single, unambiguous symbolic answer in LaTeX. Equivalent forms are allowed. No numeric approximations. Do not rely on computational tools - use traditional mathematical methods. 8. Solution Formatting: Format the equations, numbers and variables using LaTeX with Markdown syntax: Replace \\(...\\) with $...$ Replace \\[...\\] with $$...$$ 9. Language and Notation: Be rigorous and concise. Avoid colloquial terms. Use standard, consistent mathematical notation throughout. 10.
