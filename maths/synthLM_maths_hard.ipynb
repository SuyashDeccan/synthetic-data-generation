       "    'question': \"A spherical object with radius $r$ is orbiting a distant star at a distance $d$. The star has a radius $R$ and a surface temperature $T_s$. Assume that the object's orbit is much larger than both the object's radius and the star radius, so that the object subtends a small solid angle as seen from the star, and vice versa. Due to imperfect knowledge of the object's albedo, its emissivity, $\\\\epsilon$, is known only to lie within a range $[\\\\epsilon_0 - \\\\delta, \\\\epsilon_0 + \\\\delta]$, where $\\\\delta \\\\ll \\\\epsilon_0$. Determine an expression for the equilibrium temperature of the object, $T_{eq}(\\\\epsilon)$, in terms of $r$, $R$, $T_s$, $d$, $\\\\epsilon_0$, $\\\\delta$, and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant $\\\\sigma_{SB}$.\",\n",
