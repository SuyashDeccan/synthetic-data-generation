Below is the revised problem set.  Each question asks you to “Find” or “Give” exactly one symbolic object.  Display‐math uses `$$…$$`, inline math uses `$…$`, and every answer is uniquely determined.

1.  
Let $p_3(n)$ be the number of partitions of $n$ into parts not divisible by 3.  
Find the unique residue  
$$r\in\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\}$$  
such that for all integers $n\ge0$  
$$
p_3(7n+r)\;\equiv\;0\pmod7.
$$

2.  
Let  
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}B(n)\,q^n
\;=\;
\prod_{m=1}^{\infty}(1-q^m)^{-3}(1+q^m),
\qquad
\sigma_k(n)=\sum_{d\mid n}d^k.
$$  
Find the unique integers $c_1,c_3,c_5\in\Bbb Z$ such that for all integers $n\ge1$  
$$
B(n)
\;=\;
c_1\,\sigma_1(n)\;+\;c_3\,\sigma_3(n)\;+\;c_5\,\sigma_5(n).
$$

3.  
An _overpartition_ of $n$ is a partition in which the first occurrence of each distinct part may be overlined.  Let $\overline p_{\mathrm{odd}}^{\mathrm{even}}(n)$ be the number of overpartitions of $n$ into odd parts with an even number of overlined parts.  
Find the unique integer sequences $(\alpha_m)_{m\ge1}$ and $(\beta_m)_{m\ge1}$ for which  
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\overline p_{\mathrm{odd}}^{\mathrm{even}}(n)\,q^n
\;=\;
\prod_{m=1}^{\infty}(1-q^{2m-1})^{\alpha_m}(1+q^{2m-1})^{\beta_m}.
$$

4.  
Define  
$$
G_a(x,t)\;=\;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}T_{n+a}(x)\,t^n,
$$  
where $T_n(x)$ is the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind satisfying $T_n(\cos\theta)=\cos(n\theta)$.  
For a fixed nonnegative integer $a$, find the unique rational function $R(x,t)\in\Bbb Q(x,t)$ such that  
$$
G_a(x,t)\;=\;R(x,t).
$$
