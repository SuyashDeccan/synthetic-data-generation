General assumptions (apply to all questions)  
• Ideal‐solution behaviour (activity coefficients = 1)  
• ΔH° and ΔS° are temperature‐independent  
• Report all numerical answers to three significant figures and include units  

1. Thermodynamics of a Carbonate Decomposition  
CoCO₃(s) → CoO(s) + CO₂(g)  
ΔH° = +115.4 kJ mol⁻¹, ΔS° = +147 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹ (298 K)  
At what temperature, in °C, does ΔG° = 0?  

2. Base-Promoted Elimination (single output)  
Provide the full IUPAC name (including stereochemistry) of the single major alkene formed when (R)-3-bromo-4-methylhexane is treated with excess KOtBu in tert-butanol at 40 °C.  

3. Stepwise Formation of a Nickel(II)–1,2-Diaminopropane Complex  
In 1.00 L of aqueous solution at 25 °C, 0.0400 mol NiCl₂·6H₂O is dissolved and [1,2-diaminopropane] is adjusted to 0.120 M. Stepwise formation constants at 25 °C:  
  Ni²⁺ + dap ⇌ Ni(dap)²⁺ K₁ = 3.50×10⁶  
  Ni(dap)²⁺ + dap ⇌ Ni(dap)₂²⁺ K₂ = 4.80×10⁵  
  Ni(dap)₂²⁺ + dap ⇌ Ni(dap)₃²⁺ K₃ = 9.00×10⁴  
Calculate the equilibrium concentration of free Ni²⁺ (in M).  

4. Nernst Equation for a Mixed-Redox Cell  
At 25 °C, the cell is:  
  Pt | V²⁺ (0.0150 M), V³⁺ (0.100 M) ‖ Ag⁺ (0.0500 M) | Ag  
Standard potentials:  
  V³⁺ + e⁻ ⇌ V²⁺ E° = +0.255 V  
  Ag⁺ + e⁻ ⇌ Ag E° = +0.799 V  
Calculate the cell potential E_cell (in V).
