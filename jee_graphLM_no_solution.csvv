"[""Photoelectric effect: Photoelectric equation (Einstein's)"", 'Relationship between stopping potential and maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons (eV0 = KEmax)']","To determine the stopping potential \( V_0 \) in terms of the photon energy \( E_{\text{photon}} \), work function \( \phi \), and the radius \( r \) of the electron's path in a magnetic field \( B \), we proceed as follows: 1. **Photoelectric Equation**: The energy of the photon is related to the work function and the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electrons: \[ E_{\text{photon}} = \phi + K_{\text{max}} \] where \( K_{\text{max}} = eV_0 \). 2. **Magnetic Force and Circular Motion**: The magnetic force provides the centripetal force: \[ evB = \frac{mv^2}{r} \] Solving for velocity \( v \): \[ v = \frac{eBr}{m} \] 3. **Kinetic Energy of the Electron**: The kinetic energy is given by: \[ K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \] Substituting \( v \): \[ K = \frac{1}{2}m\left(\frac{eBr}{m}\right)^2 = \frac{e^2B^2r^2}{2m} \] 4. **Equating Kinetic Energies**: Since \( K_{\text{max}} = eV_0 \): \[ eV_0 = \frac{e^2B^2r^2}{2m} \] Solving for \( V_0 \): \[ V_0 = \frac{eB^2r^2}{2m} \] Thus, the stopping potential \( V_0 \) is: \[ \boxed{V_0 = \dfrac{e B^2 r^2}{2 m}} \]"

"[""Photoelectric effect: Photoelectric equation (Einstein's)"", 'Conversion of wavelength to frequency using c = λf']","To determine the maximum kinetic energy of electrons emitted in the photoelectric effect when light of wavelength λ is incident on a material with work function φ, we start with the photoelectric equation: \[ KE_{\text{max}} = hf - \phi \] Given that the frequency \( f \) can be expressed in terms of the wavelength \( \lambda \) using the equation \( c = \lambda f \), we substitute \( f = \frac{c}{\lambda} \) into the photoelectric equation: \[ KE_{\text{max}} = h \left( \frac{c}{\lambda} \right) - \phi \] Thus, the maximum kinetic energy is: \[ KE_{\text{max}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda} - \phi \] This equation gives the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons in terms of Planck's constant \( h \), the speed of light \( c \), the wavelength \( \lambda \), and the work function \( \phi \). **Answer:** The maximum kinetic energy is given by \boxed{\frac{hc}{\lambda} - \phi}."
"[""Photoelectric effect: Photoelectric equation (Einstein's)"", 'Linear relation between KEmax (or eV0) and frequency f']","To determine the stopping potential \( V_0 \) in terms of the frequency \( f \), work function \( \phi \), and constants, we start by considering the energy balance in the photoelectric effect. The energy of the incident photon is given by \( hf \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant. This energy must equal the sum of the work function \( \phi \) and the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electrons. The maximum kinetic energy of the electrons is related to the stopping potential \( V_0 \) by the equation: \[ eV_0 = \frac{1}{2}mv_{\text{max}}^2 \] where \( e \) is the elementary charge, \( m \) is the mass of the electron, and \( v_{\text{max}} \) is the maximum velocity of the electrons. Equating the photon energy to the sum of the work function and the maximum kinetic energy: \[ hf = \phi + eV_0 \] Solving for \( V_0 \): \[ V_0 = \frac{hf - \phi}{e} \] Thus, the stopping potential \( V_0 \) is expressed as: \[ V_0 = \frac{hf - \phi}{e} \] **Answer:** \[ V_0 = \boxed{\dfrac{hf - \phi}{e}} \]"
"[""Photoelectric effect: Photoelectric equation (Einstein's)"", ""Determination of Planck's constant from the slope of eV0 vs f plot (slope = h/e? Wait, no: eV0 = hf - φ, so slope of eV0 vs f is h, so h is the slope. But if plotting V0 vs f, then slope would be h/e. Wait, in the equation eV0 = hf - φ, if we rearrange to V0 = (h/e)f - φ/e. So plotting V0 vs f gives a slope of h/e, so h = slope * e. Alternatively, eV0 vs f gives slope h. So depending on what's plotted. Since the problem gives V0 and λ, so converting λ to f (using f = c/λ) and then plotting eV0 vs f would have slope h. Alternatively, plotting V0 vs 1/λ would have a linear relationship with slope hc/(e*λ)... Wait, perhaps better to think in terms of the equation.""]","To solve for Planck's constant \( h \) in terms of the given variables \( E \), \( \phi \), \( R \), and \( P \), we start with the photoelectric equation and the relationships between power, voltage, and current. 1. **Photoelectric Equation**: \[ eV = E - \phi \] where \( e \) is the elementary charge, \( V \) is the stopping potential, \( E \) is the photon energy, and \( \phi \) is the work function. 2. **Power and Voltage Relationship**: The power supplied to the circuit is given by \( P = V^2 / R \), where \( R \) is the resistance. Solving for \( V \): \[ V = \sqrt{PR} \] 3. **Substitute Voltage into Photoelectric Equation**: Substituting \( V = \sqrt{PR} \) into the photoelectric equation: \[ e\sqrt{PR} = E - \phi \] 4. **Express Photon Energy**: The photon energy \( E \) is related to Planck's constant \( h \) and the frequency \( f \) by \( E = hf \). Substituting this into the equation: \[ e\sqrt{PR} = hf - \phi \] 5. **Solve for \( h \)**: Rearranging for \( h \): \[ h = \frac{e\sqrt{PR} + \phi}{f} \] However, since \( E = hf \), we can express \( f \) as \( f = E / h \). Substituting back: \[ h = \frac{e\sqrt{PR} + \phi}{E / h} \] Simplifying: \[ h^2 = \frac{(e\sqrt{PR} + \phi)E}{h} \] \[ h^3 = (e\sqrt{PR} + \phi)E \] \[ h = \sqrt[3]{(e\sqrt{PR} + \phi)E} \] **Final Expression for Planck's Constant**: \[ h = \sqrt[3]{(e\sqrt{PR} + \phi)E} \]"
