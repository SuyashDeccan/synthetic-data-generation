1.  <question>
A researcher is developing a nanosensor for detecting Salmonella in poultry farms. The sensor utilizes a TiO2 nanomaterial functionalized with an antibody specific to Salmonella LPS. The sensor's signal output (in mV) is related to the concentration of Salmonella ($C_s$) (in CFU/mL) by the equation: $Signal = 250 + 0.5C_s$.

A farmer is testing the efficacy of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) in enhancing phosphorus uptake in wheat plants. Control plants receive no NPs, while treated plants receive ZnO NPs at a concentration of 50 mg/kg of soil. The control plants accumulate $5 \times 10^{-5}$ moles of phosphorus per gram of dry weight, while the treated plants accumulate $8 \times 10^{-5}$ moles of phosphorus per gram of dry weight. If the total dry weight of the control plants is 2 kg and that of the treated plants is 2.2 kg, calculate the difference in the total mass of phosphorus accumulated between the treated and control plants in grams.

### General Feedback

The questions demonstrate strong conceptual understanding and successful modeling of biology scenarios, largely meeting guidelines 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10. The biological contexts are relevant and the problems require multi-step reasoning.

However, there is a consistent and significant issue across all questions regarding **LaTeX formatting (Guideline 11)**, specifically:
*   Numbers and units mentioned within the prose of the question (e.g., "10 samples", "380 mV", "2 kg", "10 ppm", "0.4 volts", "100 mg/kg") are not enclosed in `$...$` for inline math.
*   Equations provided (e.g., `Signal = 250 + 0.5Cs`, `V = 0.1N + 0.05`) are presented inline rather than as block equations using `$$ \begin{aligned} ... \end{aligned} $$` as explicitly required by Guideline 11.

Addressing these formatting issues will significantly improve adherence to the technical requirements.

### Question 1 Critique

<question>
A researcher is developing a nanosensor for detecting Salmonella in poultry farms. The sensor utilizes a TiO2 nanomaterial functionalized with an antibody specific to Salmonella LPS.

*   **Guideline 11 (LaTeX syntax):** **Needs improvement.**
    *   The equation `Signal = 250 + 0.5C_s` should be formatted as a block equation using `$$ \begin{aligned} ... \end{aligned} $$`.
    *   Numbers and units in the prose should be wrapped in `$...$` (e.g., `10 \text{ samples}`, `380 \text{ mV}`, `1 \text{ mL}`).

**Actionable Feedback:**

*   **Guideline 9 (Units consistency):** Consistent. Moles/gram, kg, g/mol, grams.
*   **Guideline 11 (LaTeX syntax):** **Needs improvement.**
    *   While $5 \times 10^{-5}$ and $8 \times 10^{-5}$ are correctly formatted, other numbers and units like `2 kg`, `2.2 kg`, `30.97 g/mol` should also be wrapped in `$...$`.

*   **Guideline 9 (Units consistency):** Consistent. ppm, hours, $h^{-1}$.
*   **Guideline 11 (LaTeX syntax):** **Needs improvement.**
    *   Numbers and units in the prose should be wrapped in `$...$` (e.g., `10 ppm`, `2 hours`, `0.25 h^{-1}`, `5 hours`).

The IoT system is programmed to trigger irrigation when nitrogen levels drop below 5 ppm. If the sensor reads 0.4 volts, calculate the additional amount of nitrogen (in ppm) needed to trigger the irrigation system.

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. Integrates technology (nanosensor, IoT) with agricultural biology (nitrogen levels, irrigation).
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Met. Requires solving for current $N$, then calculating the difference from the target $N$.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units consistency):** Consistent. Volts, ppm.
*   **Guideline 11 (LaTeX syntax):** **Needs improvement.**
    *   The equation `V = 0.1N + 0.05` should be formatted as a block equation using `$$ \begin{aligned} ... \end{aligned} $$`.
    *   Numbers and units in the prose should be wrapped in `$...$` (e.g., `5 ppm`, `0.4 volts`).

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  Reformat the equation `V = 0.1N + 0.05` as a block equation.
2.  Enclose all numerical values and units in the text within `$...$` (e.g., `5 ppm` becomes `5 \text{ ppm}`).

Based on a dose-response curve model where mortality is linearly proportional to concentration up to the LC50, calculate the number of earthworms expected to die.
</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. Directly addresses toxicology in an ecological context.

**General Feedback on Formatting:**
The `format_question` function has done an excellent job of applying the LaTeX formatting for numbers, units, variables, and block equations according to guidelines 11 and 12. All inline math elements are correctly enclosed in `$ $` and block equations in `$$ \begin{aligned} ... \end{aligned} $$`.

**1. Question 1 Critique**
<question>
A researcher is developing a nanosensor for detecting Salmonella in poultry farms. The sensor utilizes a TiO2 nanomaterial functionalized with an antibody specific to Salmonella LPS. The sensor's signal output (in mV) is related to the concentration of Salmonella ($C_s$) (in CFU/mL) by the equation: $$ \begin{aligned} Signal = 250 + 0.5C_s \end{aligned} $$. In a field test, $10 \text{ samples}$ are tested and the average signal is $380 \text{ mV}$. Assuming that each test uses $1 \text{ mL}$, calculate the total number of Salmonella cells detected across all samples in CFU.
</question>

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** **Strong.** Presents a clear, relevant biological scenario (Salmonella detection, nanosensors).
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Needs Improvement.** While it involves multiple calculation steps (solve for $C_s$, calculate total CFU for one sample, then for multiple samples), the core reasoning is algebraic manipulation of a given linear equation. It tests quantitative skills more than a complex biological principle.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Good.** The specific application of a nanosensor for Salmonella is reasonably novel.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units):** **Minor Improvement.** "CFU" is a common microbiological unit but not an SI unit. While accepted, for strict rigor, ensure clarity on what CFU represents in terms of quantifiable cells if the problem relies heavily on exact SI consistency. The phrasing "Salmonella cells detected across all samples in CFU" is slightly redundant as CFU implicitly means cells. Consider "total CFU of Salmonella detected".

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Enhance Multi-Step Biological Reasoning:** Introduce a biological step that requires more than just algebraic substitution. For instance:
    *   "If Salmonella cells grow with a doubling time of X hours under optimal conditions, how long will it take for the detected concentration to reach a hazardous level (e.g., $10^6 \text{ CFU/mL}$), assuming initial conditions as detected?" This adds a growth kinetics step.
    *   "If the sensor's antibody has a binding efficiency of X%, how many *actual* Salmonella cells were likely present?" (though this adds complexity).
2.  **Refine Unit Phrasing:** Consider "calculate the total number of Salmonella in CFU across all samples."

**2. Question 2 Critique**
<question>
A farmer is testing the efficacy of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) in enhancing phosphorus uptake in wheat plants. Control plants receive no NPs, while treated plants receive ZnO NPs at a concentration of $50 \text{ mg/kg}$ of soil. The control plants accumulate $5 \times 10^{-5}$ moles of phosphorus per gram of dry weight, while the treated plants accumulate $8 \times 10^{-5}$ moles of phosphorus per gram of dry weight. If the total dry weight of the control plants is $2 \text{ kg}$ and that of the treated plants is $2.2 \text{ kg}$, calculate the difference in the total mass of phosphorus accumulated between the treated and control plants in grams. (Molar mass of Phosphorus = $30.97 \text{ g/mol}$).
</question>

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** **Strong.** Excellent biological scenario involving plant nutrition and nanotechnology.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Needs Improvement.** This question primarily tests unit conversions and stoichiometry. While multi-step, the core reasoning is quantitative chemistry/mass balance, not a complex biological principle or mechanism related to phosphorus uptake *itself*.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Good.** The specific application of ZnO NPs for phosphorus uptake is quite unique.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units):** **Minor Improvement.** "moles of phosphorus per gram of dry weight" is acceptable, but could be phrased more concisely, e.g., "moles of P per gram of dry biomass" or "P accumulation rate of $X \text{ mol} \cdot \text{g}^{-1} \text{ dry weight}$".

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Enhance Multi-Step Biological Reasoning:** Integrate a biological concept that requires deeper understanding. For example:
    *   "If this increased phosphorus uptake translates to a X% increase in grain yield, and the yield of control plants is Y kg, what is the expected increase in phosphorus removal from the soil due to the additional grain yield?" This links uptake to a biological outcome.
    *   "Assuming a typical phosphorus use efficiency, how much less phosphate fertilizer would be needed if the ZnO NPs were used?"
2.  **Refine Phrasing:** Consider slightly more concise wording for the phosphorus accumulation rates.

**3. Question 3 Critique**
<question>
A researcher is investigating the photocatalytic degradation of pesticide 'X' using TiO2 nanoparticles under UV light. Initially, the concentration of pesticide X is $10 \text{ ppm}$. After $2 \text{ hours}$ of UV irradiation, the degradation follows first-order kinetics with a rate constant ($k$) of $0.25 \text{ h}^{-1}$. Calculate the concentration of pesticide X remaining in ppm after $5 \text{ hours}$ of UV irradiation.
</question>

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** **Weak.** While environmental applications are relevant to biology, the core mechanism (photocatalytic degradation, first-order kinetics) is a chemistry/environmental engineering concept. It lacks a direct biological process.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Weak.** This is a direct, single-step application of the first-order kinetics formula ($C_t = C_0 e^{-kt}$). The "After $2 \text{ hours}$" information is redundant if the rate constant ($k$) is already given, making it less "multi-step" than it could be. If the rate constant *had* to be calculated first, it would improve this guideline.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Weak.** First-order kinetics problems are standard textbook examples in chemistry and environmental science. This is not a novel scenario.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** **Good.** Phrasing is clear and professional.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Strengthen Biology Scenario:** Reframe the question to center on a biological process exhibiting first-order kinetics. Examples:
    *   Microbial degradation of a contaminant.
    *   Radioactive tracer decay in a biological system.
    *   Enzyme kinetics (though often Michaelis-Menten, simplified first-order can be used for initial rates).
2.  **Force Multi-Step Reasoning / Uniqueness:**
    *   If using kinetics, *do not provide the rate constant directly*. Provide initial concentration and concentration after a certain time, forcing the student to calculate `k` first, then use it to find the concentration at a different time. This makes it a genuine two-step calculation.
    *   If staying with degradation, link it to biological impact: "If pesticide X inhibits photosynthesis by Y% at Z ppm, how much activity is restored after 5 hours?"
3.  **Remove Redundant Information:** As $k$ is given, "After $2 \text{ hours}$ of UV irradiation" is extraneous unless it serves a purpose to calculate $k$.

**4. Question 4 Critique**
<question>
An agricultural engineer is designing a smart irrigation system that uses a nanosensor to detect nitrogen levels in the soil. The nanosensor's output voltage ($V$) is related to the nitrogen concentration ($N$) by the equation: $$ \begin{aligned} V = 0.1N + 0.05 \end{aligned} $$, where $N$ is in ppm and $V$ is in volts. The IoT system is programmed to trigger irrigation when nitrogen levels drop below $5 \text{ ppm}$. If the sensor reads $0.4 \text{ volts}$, calculate the additional amount of nitrogen (in ppm) needed to trigger the irrigation system.
</question>

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** **Good.** Relevant to agricultural biology (nitrogen, irrigation, soil health).
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Needs Improvement.** Similar to Q1, the multi-step reasoning is primarily algebraic: solve for N, then find a difference. The biological context is present but the core reasoning is mathematical.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Good.** The combination of IoT, nanosensors, and smart irrigation is contemporary and unique.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units):** **Good.** Units are consistent and correctly formatted.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Enhance Multi-Step Biological Reasoning:** Introduce a biological principle that requires deeper understanding beyond sensor interpretation. For example:
    *   "If the plants absorb nitrogen at an average rate of X ppm/day, and assuming no other nitrogen inputs, how many days after the sensor reading will the irrigation system trigger?" This incorporates a biological rate.
    *   "If the soil has a cation exchange capacity (CEC) that can retain an additional Y ppm of nitrogen, how much excess nitrogen could be added before runoff becomes a concern for nearby aquatic ecosystems?" (This might be too complex for a single question).

**5. Question 5 Critique**
<question>
A scientist is studying the toxicity of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) to earthworms. They find that the LC50 (lethal concentration for 50% of the population) of CuO NPs in soil is $100 \text{ mg/kg}$. In an experiment, $500 \text{ earthworms}$ are exposed to soil containing CuO NPs at a concentration of $80 \text{ mg/kg}$. Based on a dose-response curve model where mortality is linearly proportional to concentration up to the LC50, calculate the number of earthworms expected to die.
</question>

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** **Excellent.** A strong, clear, and relevant ecotoxicology scenario.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Excellent.** Requires interpreting the LC50 concept, understanding the given linear dose-response model, calculating a percentage, and then calculating the absolute number. This clearly involves multiple biological principles (dose-response, population effects) and quantitative steps.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Excellent.** The specific application of NP toxicity to earthworms with a simplified linear model is unique and practical.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** **Excellent.** Very clear and professional language.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units):** **Excellent.** Units are consistent and clearly stated.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **No significant improvements needed.** This question effectively meets all the specified guidelines.

---

**Summary of Recommendations:**

*   **Strengthen Biological Core:** For questions 1, 2, 3, and 4, the biological scenario serves mostly as context for a quantitative problem. To truly "force multi-step reasoning" involving "biological principles," introduce calculations that depend on biological rates, processes, or interpretations beyond simple algebraic manipulation or unit conversions.
*   **Ensure Non-Redundant Information:** In Q3, eliminate extraneous data (like the 2-hour mark) if it doesn't contribute to calculating an unknown variable (like the rate constant).
*   **Increase Uniqueness:** For questions relying on standard formulas (like Q3's first-order kinetics), embed them within more novel and complex biological contexts.

Overall, the formatting and adherence to technical requirements (LaTeX, question tags) are outstanding. The primary area for growth is in deepening the biological reasoning required for multi-step solutions, ensuring the "biology assessment expert" aspect is central to the problem-solving.
