**Critique by Question:**

1.  <question>A population of beetles exhibits two distinct color morphs: black (BB or Bb) and yellow (bb). A researcher collects 500 beetles from a field and genotypes them. They find 45 black beetles are homozygous dominant, 255 are heterozygous, and 200 are homozygous recessive. Calculate the frequency of the *b* allele in this beetle population.</question>
    *   **Critique:** This is a solid population genetics problem. It clearly defines the scenario and requires calculating allele frequency from genotype counts. It meets most criteria well.
    *   **Area for Improvement (Uniqueness):** While well-structured, this is a very common type of population genetics problem (calculating allele frequencies from observed genotype counts, a prerequisite for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium checks). To make it more "unique" or "conceptually rich," consider:
        *   Introducing a selection pressure or migration and asking about the *change* in allele frequency over a generation.
        *   Asking about the number of heterozygous individuals if the population *were* in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, given the allele frequencies you would calculate, requiring a comparison.

2.  <question>In a controlled laboratory experiment, *E. coli* bacteria are grown in a chemostat with a constant supply of glucose. The dilution rate (D) is set to $0.7\, \text{h}^{-1}$, and the influent substrate concentration ($S_R$) is $10\, \text{g/L}$. The bacteria have a maximum specific growth rate ($\mu_{max}$) of $1.0\, \text{h}^{-1}$ and a Monod constant ($K_S$) of $2\, \text{g/L}$. Determine the substrate concentration (S) in the chemostat at steady state, assuming Monod kinetics.</question>
    *   **Critique:** Excellent question for a biochemical engineering or advanced microbiology context. It correctly applies the principles of chemostat operation and Monod kinetics.
    *   **Area for Improvement (Uniqueness):** This is a standard chemostat steady-state calculation. To enhance uniqueness or complexity:
        *   Introduce an additional factor like maintenance energy or yield coefficient and ask for biomass concentration.
        *   Ask about the dilution rate required to achieve a specific substrate concentration, or the dilution rate at which washout would occur.

3.  <question>A researcher is studying a novel enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of substrate A to product B. They perform an enzyme assay and determine that the initial reaction velocity is $25\, \mu\text{mol/min}$ when the substrate concentration is $0.5\, \text{mM}$. They also find that the maximum velocity ($V_{max}$) of the enzyme is $75\, \mu\text{mol/min}$. Calculate the Michaelis constant ($K_M$) for this enzyme in mM, assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics.</question>
    *   **Critique:** A fundamental enzyme kinetics problem, correctly applying the Michaelis-Menten equation.
    *   **Area for Improvement (Uniqueness):** This is arguably *the* most common Michaelis-Menten problem. To improve uniqueness and conceptual depth:
        *   Provide two sets of (initial velocity, substrate concentration) data points and ask for both $K_M$ and $V_{max}$ (requiring simultaneous equations or a graphical approach if students are expected to know Lineweaver-Burk).
        *   Introduce an inhibitor (competitive, uncompetitive, or non-competitive) and provide data to calculate apparent $K_M$ or $V_{max}$.
        *   Ask for the turnover number ($k_{cat}$) if enzyme concentration is provided.

4.  <question>A plant cell is placed in a sucrose solution with a water potential ($\Psi_s$) of $-0.8\, \text{MPa}$. The cell has an osmotic potential ($\Psi_\pi$) of $-1.2\, \text{MPa}$ and a pressure potential ($\Psi_p$) of $0.5\, \text{MPa}$. Calculate the water potential gradient ($\Delta\Psi$) between the cell and the sucrose solution (i.e., $\Psi_{cell} - \Psi_{solution}$) in MPa. Assume atmospheric pressure is 0 MPa.</question>
    *   **Critique:** A direct application of water potential principles in plant physiology. It correctly assesses the understanding of how to calculate cell water potential and a gradient.
    *   **Area for Improvement (Uniqueness):** This is a very standard water potential calculation. To make it more unique:
        *   Ask about the *net direction* of water movement, and then quantify the potential for that movement (which is what the gradient represents).
        *   Introduce a scenario where turgor pressure changes and ask how that affects the cell's water potential, or the conditions under which the cell might become turgid or flaccid.
        *   Ask for the specific osmotic potential of the sucrose solution given its molarity and temperature.

5.  <question>A population of fish in a lake is being studied. The intrinsic rate of increase (r) is estimated to be 0.2 per year. The carrying capacity (K) of the lake for this fish species is 10,000. Assuming the population follows the logistic growth model, what is the population growth rate ($dN/dt$) when the population size (N) is 5,000?</question>
    *   **Critique:** A very common ecology problem assessing the logistic growth model.
    *   **Area for Improvement (Uniqueness):** This is the most basic application of the logistic growth equation. To make it more unique:
        *   Ask for the population size (N) at which the population growth rate ($dN/dt$) is maximal.
        *   Introduce a constant harvesting rate and ask for the stable equilibrium population size under harvesting.
        *   Given observed population sizes over time, ask for 'r' or 'K' (though this might require more complex data interpretation or graphical analysis, potentially becoming multipart).

6.  <question> During a PCR reaction, starting with a single DNA template molecule, how many DNA molecules will there be after 15 cycles, assuming ideal amplification efficiency?</question>
    *   **Critique:** A direct and common molecular biology calculation for PCR amplification.
    *   **Area for Improvement (Uniqueness):** This is a very simple power-of-2 calculation. To make it more unique or multi-step:
        *   Start with a different initial number of template molecules (e.g., 100 copies).
        *   Introduce an amplification efficiency factor (e.g., 90% efficiency) which requires calculating $(initial\_copies) \times (efficiency)^n$. This adds a significant layer of biological realism and calculation complexity.
        *   Ask about the number of *specific length* molecules (i.e., those bounded by primers) after a certain number of cycles, which only applies after the first few cycles, or if starting with different primer locations.

7.  <question>In a diploid organism, a gene has three alleles: $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$. A population survey reveals the following genotype frequencies: $A_1A_1 = 0.25$, $A_1A_2 = 0.20$, $A_2A_2 = 0.16$, $A_1A_3 = 0.10$, $A_2A_3 = 0.08$, and $A_3A_3 = 0.21$. Calculate the frequency of the $A_2$ allele in this population.</question>
    *   **Critique:** This is a good population genetics question. While calculating allele frequencies from genotype frequencies is standard, the presence of three alleles adds a beneficial layer of complexity compared to the typical two-allele problem, requiring careful summation. It meets all criteria well.
    *   **Area for Improvement (Minor Uniqueness):** To push the uniqueness further, one could ask if the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for all three alleles, which would require calculating expected genotype frequencies and comparing.

8.  <question> Two unlinked genes, A and B, are located on different chromosomes. An individual with the genotype AaBb is testcrossed to an individual with the genotype aabb. What proportion of the offspring would you expect to have the genotype Aabb?</question>
    *   **Critique:** A classic Mendelian genetics problem involving a dihybrid testcross.
    *   **Area for Improvement (Uniqueness):** This is a very common, foundational genetics problem. To significantly improve uniqueness and conceptual depth:
        *   Introduce gene linkage and a recombination frequency, requiring students to calculate the proportion of offspring based on linkage.
        *   Add more genes (e.g., a trihybrid cross).
        *   Introduce a non-Mendelian inheritance pattern (e.g., incomplete dominance, codominance, epistasis) and ask about phenotypic ratios.
        *   Present a pedigree and ask for the probability of a certain genotype or phenotype in a future offspring, requiring inference from the pedigree.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The questions are technically sound, well-phrased, and adhere to most of your guidelines. The primary area for improvement across the board is **"Be Unique"** and "Create novel, conceptually rich scenarios." Many of these questions are standard, direct applications of foundational formulas. For undergraduate-level assessment, this is often acceptable to test basic competency. However, if the goal is to challenge students with truly novel problem-solving or deeper conceptual integration, the suggested improvements above could elevate these questions from "standard application" to "conceptually rich problem-solving."
=== Turn 1: Author refines questions ===
Here are the refined questions, incorporating the feedback provided, each designed to be slightly more unique and conceptually rich while still adhering to the original constraints:

1.  <question>A population of butterflies exhibits two wing color morphs: iridescent blue (BB or Bb) and matte white (bb). A researcher tracks allele frequencies in a butterfly population over two generations. In generation 1, they find 600 butterflies and determine the frequency of the *b* allele to be 0.4. In generation 2, after significant migration of butterflies from a nearby population, they sample 800 butterflies and find the frequency of the *b* allele has changed to 0.5. Assuming the change in allele frequency is solely due to migration, what proportion of the butterflies in generation 2 are migrants?</question>

2.  <question> *E. coli* bacteria are grown in a chemostat with a constant supply of glucose. The dilution rate (D) is set to $0.5\, \text{h}^{-1}$, and the influent substrate concentration ($S_R$) is $8\, \text{g/L}$. The bacteria have a maximum specific growth rate ($\mu_{max}$) of $1.2\, \text{h}^{-1}$ and a Monod constant ($K_S$) of $1.5\, \text{g/L}$. Additionally, the bacteria have a yield coefficient ($Y_{X/S}$) of 0.4 g biomass/g substrate.

3.  <question>A researcher is studying a novel enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of substrate A to product B. They perform two enzyme assays. In the first assay, the initial reaction velocity is $30\, \mu\text{mol/min}$ when the substrate concentration is $0.2\, \text{mM}$. In the second assay, the initial reaction velocity is $45\, \mu\text{mol/min}$ when the substrate concentration is $0.5\, \text{mM}$. Assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics, calculate the Michaelis constant ($K_M$) for this enzyme in mM.</question>

4.  <question>A plant cell with an osmotic potential ($\Psi_\pi$) of $-1.4\, \text{MPa}$ and an initial pressure potential ($\Psi_p$) of $0.4\, \text{MPa}$ is placed in a beaker containing pure water at 25°C. After reaching equilibrium, the cell is turgid, with a pressure potential equal to its maximum value of 0.9 MPa. By how many MPa did the cell's water potential increase after being placed in the water?</question>

5.  <question>A population of fish in a lake is being studied. The intrinsic rate of increase (r) is estimated to be 0.3 per year. The carrying capacity (K) of the lake for this fish species is 8,000. Assuming the population follows the logistic growth model, at what population size (N) is the population growth rate ($dN/dt$) maximal?</question>

7.  <question>In a diploid organism, a gene has three alleles: $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$. A population survey reveals the following genotype frequencies: $A_1A_1 = 0.20$, $A_1A_2 = 0.15$, $A_2A_2 = 0.10$, $A_1A_3 = 0.10$, $A_2A_3 = 0.10$, and $A_3A_3 = 0.25$. Calculate the expected frequency of the $A_1A_2$ genotype *if* the population were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium based on the observed allele frequencies.</question>

8.  <question>Two genes, *R* and *S*, are located on the same chromosome. An individual with the genotype *RS/rs* is testcrossed to an individual with the genotype *rs/rs*.

1.  <question>A population of butterflies exhibits two wing color morphs: iridescent blue (BB or Bb) and matte white (bb). A researcher tracks allele frequencies in a butterfly population over two generations. In generation 1, they find 600 butterflies and determine the frequency of the *b* allele to be 0.4. In generation 2, after significant migration of butterflies from a nearby population, they sample 800 butterflies and find the frequency of the *b* allele has changed to 0.5. Assuming the change in allele frequency is solely due to migration, what proportion of the butterflies in generation 2 are migrants?</question>

    *   **Critique:** This question suffers from **ambiguity and potential lack of multi-step reasoning.**
        *   **Ambiguity:** "In generation 1, they find 600 butterflies" and "they sample 800 butterflies" can be interpreted as either total population sizes or sample sizes.
        *   **Interpretation A (Population Sizes):** If the population *grew* from 600 to 800 *solely due to migration*, then the number of migrants is $800-600=200$. The proportion of migrants is then $200/800 = 0.25$. In this case, the allele frequency data ($0.4$ and $0.5$) is superfluous for calculating the *proportion of migrants*, failing "Force Multi-Step Reasoning" as the primary calculation is a single arithmetic step.
        *   **Interpretation B (Sample Sizes, or complex population dynamics):** If 600 and 800 are sample sizes, or the total population isn't simply $N_{initial} + N_{migrants}$, then the standard migration formula $q_2 = (1-m)q_1 + mq_m$ applies. However, $q_m$ (allele frequency of migrants) is unknown, making the problem **underspecified** and thus failing "Single Solution".
        *   **Uniqueness:** The ambiguity creates a non-standard problem, but not in a conceptually rich way.

    *   **Improvement:** Clarify the population dynamics explicitly.
        *   **Option 1 (Focus on population size change and make allele frequencies relevant):** Ask for the *allele frequency of the migrant population* instead, given the population size change. Example: "An initial population of 600 butterflies with *b* allele frequency of 0.4 had 200 migrants join them to form a new population of 800. If the *b* allele frequency in the new population is 0.5, what was the frequency of the *b* allele in the migrant population?" (This is multi-step and uses all data).
        *   **Option 2 (Force multi-step for migration proportion):** Provide $q_m$. Example: "A population has a *b* allele frequency of 0.4. After migration from a population where the *b* allele frequency is 0.8, the allele frequency in the recipient population changes to 0.5. What proportion of the new population consists of migrants?" (This uses the migration formula for $m$ as the unknown).

2.  <question> *E. coli* bacteria are grown in a chemostat with a constant supply of glucose. The dilution rate (D) is set to $0.5\, \text{h}^{-1}$, and the influent substrate concentration ($S_R$) is $8\, \text{g/L}$. The bacteria have a maximum specific growth rate ($\mu_{max}$) of $1.2\, \text{h}^{-1}$ and a Monod constant ($K_S$) of $1.5\, \text{g/L}$. Additionally, the bacteria have a yield coefficient ($Y_{X/S}$) of 0.4 g biomass/g substrate. Calculate the steady-state biomass concentration (X) in the chemostat, assuming Monod kinetics and neglecting maintenance energy.</question>

    *   **Critique:** **Excellent.** This question perfectly aligns with all guidelines. It presents a clear biological scenario, requires multi-step reasoning (calculate steady-state S, then X), has a single numerical solution, uses consistent units and notation, and is concisely phrased.
    *   **Improvement:** None needed.

3.  <question>A researcher is studying a novel enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of substrate A to product B. They perform two enzyme assays. In the first assay, the initial reaction velocity is $30\, \mu\text{mol/min}$ when the substrate concentration is $0.2\, \text{mM}$. In the second assay, the initial reaction velocity is $45\, \mu\text{mol/min}$ when the substrate concentration is $0.5\, \text{mM}$. Assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics, calculate the Michaelis constant ($K_M$) for this enzyme in mM.</question>

    *   **Critique:** **Excellent.** This question fully meets all criteria. It describes a biological experiment, requires multi-step algebraic problem-solving (solving a system of two Michaelis-Menten equations), has a unique numerical solution, uses appropriate units and notation, and is clearly phrased.
    *   **Improvement:** None needed.

4.  <question>A plant cell with an osmotic potential ($\Psi_\pi$) of $-1.4\, \text{MPa}$ and an initial pressure potential ($\Psi_p$) of $0.4\, \text{MPa}$ is placed in a beaker containing pure water at 25°C. After reaching equilibrium, the cell is turgid, with a pressure potential equal to its maximum value of 0.9 MPa. By how many MPa did the cell's water potential increase after being placed in the water?</question>

    *   **Critique:** **Good.** This question effectively models a biological scenario and requires multi-step reasoning. The key conceptual step is understanding that a plant cell in equilibrium with pure water ($\Psi_{water}=0$) will have its own water potential ($\Psi_{cell}$) also at 0 MPa. The given final pressure potential ($0.9\, \text{MPa}$) then implies a change in osmotic potential due to water influx and dilution, leading to a $\Psi_{cell} = 0$. This tests a deeper understanding beyond simple formula application.
    *   **Improvement:** No critical improvements needed. The phrasing "After reaching equilibrium" and "placed in a beaker containing pure water" is generally sufficient to imply $\Psi_{final}=0$.

5.  <question>A population of fish in a lake is being studied. The intrinsic rate of increase (r) is estimated to be 0.3 per year. The carrying capacity (K) of the lake for this fish species is 8,000. Assuming the population follows the logistic growth model, at what population size (N) is the population growth rate ($dN/dt$) maximal?</question>

    *   **Critique:** **Good, but lacks uniqueness.** While it fits most criteria, finding that the maximal growth rate in a logistic model occurs at $N=K/2$ is a very standard, almost definitional, result taught in population ecology. It tests recall of a specific property rather than a complex multi-step calculation or novel application.
    *   **Improvement:** To enhance uniqueness and multi-step reasoning, consider asking for:
        *   The *value* of the maximal population growth rate ($dN/dt_{max}$).
        *   The population size at a specific *fraction* of the maximal growth rate.
        *   The *time* required to reach this maximal growth rate, given an initial population size.

6.  <question>During a PCR reaction, starting with 50 copies of a DNA template molecule, how many DNA molecules will there be after 20 cycles, assuming an amplification efficiency of 85% per cycle?</question>

    *   **Critique:** **Good, but lacks uniqueness.** This is a clear and well-posed question that fits most guidelines. However, calculating PCR yield with efficiency is a very common, standard problem type in molecular biology. It primarily tests the application of a known formula, lacking deeper conceptual integration or novelty.
    *   **Improvement:** To enhance uniqueness and multi-step reasoning, consider scenarios such as:
        *   Asking for the number of cycles required to reach a certain number of copies.
        *   Incorporating a threshold for detection (e.g., in qPCR).
        *   Involving different efficiencies for different primer pairs or template types.

7.  <question>In a diploid organism, a gene has three alleles: $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$. A population survey reveals the following genotype frequencies: $A_1A_1 = 0.20$, $A_1A_2 = 0.15$, $A_2A_2 = 0.10$, $A_1A_3 = 0.10$, $A_2A_3 = 0.10$, and $A_3A_3 = 0.25$. Calculate the expected frequency of the $A_1A_2$ genotype *if* the population were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium based on the observed allele frequencies.</question>

    *   **Critique:** **Excellent.** This question fully meets all criteria. It presents a relevant biological scenario, requires multi-step reasoning (calculating allele frequencies first, then applying HWE principles for multiple alleles), has a unique numerical solution, uses appropriate notation, and is concisely phrased. The three-allele system adds a good level of complexity.
    *   **Improvement:** None needed.

8.  <question>Two genes, *R* and *S*, are located on the same chromosome. An individual with the genotype *RS/rs* is testcrossed to an individual with the genotype *rs/rs*. The recombination frequency between the two genes is 10%. What proportion of the offspring would you expect to have the genotype *Rs/rs*?</question>

    *   **Critique:** **Good, but lacks uniqueness.** This is a clear and correct question that fits most guidelines. However, testcross problems with linked genes are very standard in genetics courses. It primarily tests the understanding and application of the direct relationship between recombination frequency and gamete frequencies.
    *   **Improvement:** To enhance uniqueness and multi-step reasoning, consider:
        *   A three-point cross scenario, asking for the frequency of a specific double-crossover genotype.
        *   Working backward from offspring phenotypic ratios to deduce linkage or recombination frequency.
        *   Combining with concepts of interference or genetic mapping.
