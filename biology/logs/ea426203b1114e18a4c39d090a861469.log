The Monod equation parameters for this yeast are: maximum specific growth rate ($\mu_{max}$) = $0.5 \, h^{-1}$ and the saturation constant ($K_s$) = $2 \, g/L$. What is the steady-state concentration of the limiting nutrient ($S$) in the chemostat?
</question>

**Critique:** This is an excellent question.
*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Yes, a classic and fundamental bioprocess scenario (chemostat dynamics) involving microbial growth kinetics.
*   **2. Expect single word/numerical answer:** Yes, a single numerical concentration.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes. It requires recalling the steady-state principle ($\mu = D$), applying the Monod equation ($\mu = \mu_{max} \frac{S}{K_s + S}$), and then algebraically solving for S.
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** Yes, asks for a specific quantitative result.

*   **7. Rigorous, concise phrasing:** Yes, uses standard notation and is very clear.
*   **8. Units consistent; conventional notation:** Yes, all units are consistent ($h^{-1}$, $g/L$) and the answer will have appropriate units.

<question>
In a study of bacterial growth, researchers inoculate $10^3$ bacterial cells into a nutrient broth. After 3 hours, the cell density reaches $8 \times 10^6$ cells/mL. Assuming exponential growth, what is the doubling time of the bacteria in minutes?
</question>

**Critique:** This is an excellent question.
*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Yes, a common and fundamental scenario in microbiology (bacterial growth kinetics).
*   **2. Expect single word/numerical answer:** Yes, a single numerical time in minutes.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes. It requires using the exponential growth equation ($N_t = N_0 \cdot 2^{t/g}$ or $N_t = N_0 \cdot e^{\mu t}$), solving for the doubling time or specific growth rate, and critically, converting the time units from hours to minutes.
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** Yes, asks for a specific quantitative result.
*   **5. Be Unique:** While exponential growth calculations are standard, the specific numbers and the requirement for unit conversion make it a good, non-trivial application.
*   **6. Single Solution:** Yes, one correct numerical answer.
*   **7. Rigorous, concise phrasing:** Yes, clear and uses standard notation.
*   **8. Units consistent; conventional notation:** Yes, explicitly asks for the answer in minutes, requiring a unit conversion from the given hours, which is a good test of attention to detail.
*   **9. Not multipart:** Yes, focuses on a single target quantity.

**Actionable Feedback:** No improvements needed. This question perfectly aligns with all guidelines.

<question>
Two linked genes, A and B, are separated by a distance of 10 map units on a chromosome. An individual with the genotype $AaBb$ in coupling (cis) phase undergoes meiosis. What percentage of the resulting gametes will have the genotype $ab$, assuming no crossover interference?
</question>

**Critique:** This is an excellent question.
*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Yes, a core scenario in genetics (linked genes, recombination, meiosis).
*   **2. Expect single word/numerical answer:** Yes, a single numerical percentage.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes. It requires understanding that map units translate directly to recombination frequency (10 map units = 10% recombination frequency). Then, understanding that for linked genes in cis configuration ($AB/ab$), the parental gametes are $AB$ and $ab$, and recombinant gametes are $Ab$ and $aB$. The 10% recombination means 5% $Ab$ and 5% $aB$. The remaining 90% are parental, split equally: 45% $AB$ and 45% $ab$. This is clearly multi-step.
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** Yes, asks for a specific quantitative result.
*   **5. Be Unique:** While linkage problems are standard, this specific setup (cis phase, calculating one specific parental gamete type) is a solid and clear application.
*   **6. Single Solution:** Yes, one correct numerical answer.
*   **7. Rigorous, concise phrasing:** Yes, uses standard genetic terminology (map units, coupling/cis phase, genotype notation).
*   **8. Units consistent; conventional notation:** Yes, percentages are used appropriately.
*   **9. Not multipart:** Yes, focuses on a single target quantity.

**Actionable Feedback:** No improvements needed. This question perfectly aligns with all guidelines.

<question>
An enzyme catalyzes a reaction with a $K_M$ of $5 \times 10^{-6} \, M$ and a $V_{max}$ of $20 \, \mu mol/min$. What is the initial velocity of the reaction, in $\mu mol/min$, when the substrate concentration is $1 \times 10^{-5} \, M$?
</question>

**Critique:** This is a good question for basic application, but has room for improvement regarding uniqueness and depth of multi-step reasoning.
*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Yes, a fundamental scenario in biochemistry (enzyme kinetics).
*   **2. Expect single word/numerical answer:** Yes, a single numerical velocity.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Partially. It primarily requires recalling the Michaelis-Menten equation and substituting values. While this is technically "multi-step" (recall, substitute, calculate), it's a very direct application, which might not be considered "two or more biological principles" or particularly deep reasoning.
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** Yes, asks for a specific quantitative result.
*   **5. Be Unique:** No. This is a highly standard, textbook "plug-and-chug" problem for the Michaelis-Menten equation. It does not present a "novel, conceptually rich scenario."
*   **6. Single Solution:** Yes, one correct numerical answer.
*   **7. Rigorous, concise phrasing:** Yes, clear and uses standard notation.
*   **8. Units consistent; conventional notation:** Yes, all units are consistent and correct.
*   **9. Not multipart:** Yes, focuses on a single target quantity.

**Actionable Feedback:** To enhance its uniqueness and multi-step reasoning, consider revising it:
*   **Option 1 (Reverse Calculation):** Ask for $V_{max}$ or $K_M$ given an initial velocity and substrate concentration, which forces rearrangement of the equation.
    *   *Example:* "An enzyme catalyzes a reaction at an initial velocity of $13.33 \, \mu mol/min$ when the substrate concentration is $1 \times 10^{-5} \, M$. If the $K_M$ for this enzyme is $5 \times 10^{-6} \, M$, what is the $V_{max}$ of the reaction in $\mu mol/min$?"
*   **Option 2 (Relative Change/Ratio):** Ask for a ratio or percentage change in velocity under different conditions, requiring multiple applications of the equation and then a comparison.
    *   *Example:* "An enzyme has a $K_M$ of $5 \times 10^{-6} \, M$. By what factor does the initial velocity of the reaction increase when the substrate concentration is raised from $1 \times 10^{-6} \, M$ to $1 \times 10^{-5} \, M$, assuming a constant $V_{max}$?"
*   **Option 3 (Conceptual Application):** Present a scenario that requires understanding the behavior of the equation at very high or very low substrate concentrations.
    *   *Example:* "An enzyme has a $K_M$ of $5 \times 10^{-6} \, M$ and a $V_{max}$ of $20 \, \mu mol/min$. If the substrate concentration is $1 \times 10^{-7} \, M$, what is the approximate initial velocity of the reaction in $\mu mol/min$, assuming the reaction follows first-order kinetics under these conditions?" (This would test the understanding that at [S] << KM, V0 approx. (Vmax/KM)*[S]).
