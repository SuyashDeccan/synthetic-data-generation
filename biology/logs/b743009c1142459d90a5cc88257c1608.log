Here's a critique of each question against your guidelines, with concise, actionable feedback for improvement:

---

**Question 1:**
<question>A researcher is studying the effect of a novel antibiotic on a bacterial population. Initially, the bacterial density is $5 \times 10^6$ cells/mL. After 24 hours of incubation with the antibiotic, the bacterial density decreases to $2 \times 10^6$ cells/mL. Assuming exponential decay, calculate the decay rate constant ($k$) of the bacterial population under the antibiotic treatment, reporting the answer in $h^{-1}$.</question>

*   **Critique:** While set in a biology scenario, this is a very standard quantitative problem that primarily tests the application of a mathematical formula for exponential decay ($N(t) = N_0 e^{-kt}$). It lacks uniqueness and deep biological multi-step reasoning beyond formula application.
*   **Improvement:** Integrate a second biological principle. For example, connect the decay rate to a physiological outcome (e.g., cell viability, threshold for infection clearance).
    *   **Revised Example:** <question>A researcher is studying a novel antibiotic. The minimum bacterial density for a successful infection is $1 \times 10^5$ cells/mL. If the initial bacterial density is $5 \times 10^6$ cells/mL and the antibiotic treatment leads to an exponential decay rate constant ($k$) of $0.05\, \mathrm{h^{-1}}$, calculate the minimum time, in hours, required for the bacterial population to fall below the infection threshold, assuming no new growth.</question>

---

**Question 2:**
<question>In a closed ecosystem containing only a plant species and a herbivore species, the plant's net primary productivity (NPP) is measured to be $5000\, \mathrm{kJ/m^2/year}$. The herbivore consumes $80\%$ of the NPP, and $20\%$ of the consumed energy is assimilated. Assuming the herbivore's respiration accounts for $60\%$ of the assimilated energy, determine the secondary productivity (SP) of the herbivore population in $\mathrm{kJ/m^2/year}$.</question>

*   **Critique:** This is an excellent question. It models a clear biological scenario, requires multiple distinct steps involving biological principles (NPP, consumption, assimilation, respiration, secondary productivity), and yields a single numerical answer with correct units. It is unique in its specific values and chain of calculation.
*   **Improvement:** No specific improvement needed; it aligns well with all guidelines.

---

**Question 3:**
<question>A population of insects exhibits a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for a gene with two alleles, A and a. The frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (aa) is 0.04. What is the frequency of the dominant allele (A) in this population?</question>

*   **Critique:** This is a very common and direct application of Hardy-Weinberg principles ($q^2 \to q \to p$). While multi-step, it fails on the "Be Unique" guideline as it's a textbook staple for introducing the concept.
*   **Improvement:** Make it more unique or add a layer of complexity beyond simple allele frequency calculation.
    *   **Revised Example:** <question>In a population of fruit flies, a gene for wing shape has two alleles, $W$ (wild-type) and $w$ (vestigial). Vestigial wings are recessive. In a sample of 1000 flies, 490 flies have wild-type wings, and 510 have vestigial wings. Assuming the population is not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, calculate the expected frequency of the heterozygous genotype ($Ww$) if the population were to reach Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with the current allele frequencies.</question> (This would require first calculating actual allele frequencies, then applying H-W for the *expected* genotype frequency).

---

**Question 4:**
<question>A cell undergoing meiosis has a total of 16 chromosomes at the beginning of prophase I. If crossing over occurs between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes an average of 2.5 times per homologous pair, calculate the total number of recombinant chromosomes that will be produced at the end of meiosis II, assuming each chromosome separates successfully.</question>

*   **Critique:** The phrase "an average of 2.5 times per homologous pair" is problematic for a discrete event (crossovers) and can lead to ambiguity or an unfeasible calculation for a single, precise numerical answer. While there's a common interpretation to yield a specific answer (8 pairs * 2.5 crossovers/pair * 2 recombinant chromatids/crossover = 40), the phrasing is biologically imprecise for an exact count.
*   **Improvement:** Rephrase the "average" to a definite, integer number of crossovers to ensure a single, unambiguous solution.
    *   **Revised Example:** <question>A cell undergoing meiosis has a total of 16 chromosomes at the beginning of prophase I. If *each* homologous pair undergoes precisely 2 crossing over events between non-sister chromatids, calculate the total number of recombinant chromosomes that will be produced at the end of meiosis II, assuming each chromosome separates successfully.</question>

---

**Question 5:**
<question>An enzyme catalyzes a reaction with a Michaelis constant ($K_m$) of $5\,\mathrm{\mu M}$. At a substrate concentration of $10\,\mathrm{\mu M}$, the reaction velocity is $20\,\mathrm{\mu mol/min}$. What is the maximum reaction velocity ($V_{max}$) of the enzyme in $\mathrm{\mu mol/min}$?</question>

*   **Critique:** This is a direct, single-step application of the Michaelis-Menten equation and is a very common textbook problem, failing on "Be Unique." It primarily tests formula recall and algebraic manipulation rather than deeper conceptual multi-step biological reasoning.
*   **Improvement:** Introduce an additional biological principle, such as enzyme inhibition, or ask for an outcome under changed conditions.
    *   **Revised Example:** <question>An enzyme catalyzes a reaction with a Michaelis constant ($K_m$) of $5\,\mathrm{\mu M}$ and a maximum reaction velocity ($V_{max}$) of $60\,\mathrm{\mu mol/min}$. If a non-competitive inhibitor is added that reduces the $V_{max}$ by 25%, what is the reaction velocity, in $\mathrm{\mu mol/min}$, at a substrate concentration of $10\,\mathrm{\mu M}$?</question>

---

**Question 6:**
<question>A plant cell with a solute potential ($\Psi_s$) of $-0.8\,\mathrm{MPa}$ is placed in a solution with a water potential ($\Psi_w$) of $-0.5\,\mathrm{MPa}$. If the pressure potential ($\Psi_p$) of the cell is initially $0.2\,\mathrm{MPa}$, what is the water potential of the cell ($\Psi_w$) in $\mathrm{MPa}$?</question>

*   **Critique:** This is a very common and direct application of the water potential formula ($\Psi_w = \Psi_s + \Psi_p$). The solution's water potential is extraneous for calculating the *initial* cell water potential, adding a minor data-filtering step, but it still largely lacks uniqueness and multi-step reasoning beyond formula recall.
*   **Improvement:** Require reasoning about water movement and equilibrium to derive a different potential.
    *   **Revised Example:** <question>A plant cell with an initial solute potential ($\Psi_s$) of $-0.8\,\mathrm{MPa}$ is placed in a solution with a water potential ($\Psi_w$) of $-0.5\,\mathrm{MPa}$. If the cell's initial pressure potential ($\Psi_p$) is $0.2\,\mathrm{MPa}$, calculate the cell's pressure potential ($\Psi_p$) in $\mathrm{MPa}$ once it reaches equilibrium with the surrounding solution, assuming the solute potential of the cell remains constant.</question>

---

**Question 7:**
<question>A bacterial culture initially contains $10^3$ cells. The bacteria divide by binary fission every 20 minutes. Assuming unlimited resources, how many bacteria will be present after 2 hours, expressed in scientific notation as $a \times 10^b$? Give only the value of 'b' (the exponent).</question>

*   **Critique:** This is a very common bacterial growth calculation problem, lacking uniqueness. While it involves unit conversion and applying the exponential growth formula, it's a standard textbook example.
*   **Improvement:** Add a biological constraint or an additional step that makes it less straightforward.
    *   **Revised Example:** <question>A bacterial culture is inoculated with $10^3$ cells. After a 30-minute lag phase, the bacteria begin to divide by binary fission every 20 minutes. How many bacteria will be present after a total of 2 hours (including the lag phase), expressed in scientific notation as $a \times 10^b$? Give only the value of 'b' (the exponent).</question>

---

**Question 8:**
<question>A species of fish exhibits temperature-dependent sex determination. Above $30\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$, all offspring are female, and below $25\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$, all offspring are male. If the average daily temperature of a breeding site is normally distributed with a mean of $27\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$ and a standard deviation of $2\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$, approximate the proportion of female offspring produced (as a percentage). Assume a linear relationship between temperature and sex ratio within the range $25-30\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$.</question>

*   **Critique:** This question is conceptually outstanding, highly unique, and models a realistic biological scenario integrating ecological principles with statistics. However, calculating the *expected* proportion of female offspring (involving integrating a linear function over a segment of a normal distribution) is mathematically too complex for a "single numerical answer" in a typical undergraduate biology assessment without specific tools or pre-provided values. This makes it difficult to have a single, non-ambiguous answer for students using standard tables/calculators.
*   **Improvement:** Simplify the statistical calculation by asking for a probability within a clear range, or provide additional information to make the integration solvable with basic tools.
    *   **Revised Example (Simplified Statistics):** <question>A species of fish exhibits temperature-dependent sex determination. Above $30\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$, all offspring are female, and below $25\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$, all offspring are male. If the average daily temperature of a breeding site is normally distributed with a mean of $27\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$ and a standard deviation of $2\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$, what is the probability, as a percentage, that *all* offspring produced on a given day will be female?</question> (This only requires calculating P(T > 30°C) from the normal distribution).

---

**Question 9:**
<question>In a population of butterflies, wing color is determined by a single gene with two alleles: $C^B$ (black) and $C^W$ (white). Heterozygotes ($C^BC^W$) have gray wings. A sample of 500 butterflies reveals 320 black-winged butterflies, 160 gray-winged butterflies, and 20 white-winged butterflies. Calculate the frequency of the $C^B$ allele in this population.</question>

*   **Critique:** This is a solid question. It sets up a realistic biological scenario (incomplete dominance), requires multiple steps to count alleles from genotype frequencies, and yields a single numerical answer. It's a good variation of a standard population genetics problem and tests conceptual understanding of allele counting.
*   **Improvement:** No specific improvement needed; it aligns well with all guidelines.

---

**Question 10:**
<question>A researcher is studying a population of cells in vitro. The initial cell count is $1 \times 10^5$ cells/mL. After 48 hours, the cell count is $8 \times 10^5$ cells/mL. Assuming exponential growth, calculate the doubling time ($t_d$) of the cell population in hours.</question>

*   **Critique:** This is a very common cell growth/doubling time calculation. While it requires applying the exponential growth model, it lacks uniqueness and could be considered a standard textbook problem.
*   **Improvement:** Add a scenario that requires more than a direct formula application, like a lag phase or a change in conditions.
    *   **Revised Example:** <question>A researcher is studying a population of cells. The initial cell count is $1 \times 10^5$ cells/mL. After 48 hours, the cell count is $8 \times 10^5$ cells/mL. If a specific nutrient became limiting after 36 hours, reducing the growth rate by 50% for the remaining time, calculate the doubling time ($t_d$) of the cell population in hours *before* the nutrient limitation occurred.</question> (This adds conditional growth rates and requires breaking down the time period).

    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes, unambiguous.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous Phrasing):** Excellent.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Units/Notation):** Excellent.
    *   **Overall:** A solid, well-formulated question.

*   **Actionable Feedback:** To enhance uniqueness (Guideline 5), consider adding a slight twist, e.g., a short lag phase before decay or a combination of decay and very slow residual growth.

**Question 2:**
<question>In a closed ecosystem containing only a plant species and a herbivore species, the plant's net primary productivity (NPP) is measured to be $5000\, \mathrm{kJ/m^2/year}$. The herbivore consumes $80\%$ of the NPP, and $20\%$ of the consumed energy is assimilated. Assuming the herbivore's respiration accounts for $60\%$ of the assimilated energy, determine the secondary productivity (SP) of the herbivore population in $\mathrm{kJ/m^2/year}$.</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Scenario):** Excellent. Directly addresses energy flow in an ecosystem.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Excellent. Requires sequential calculations and understanding of NPP, assimilated energy, respiration, and SP.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Unique):** Good, but it's a very standard ecological efficiency calculation often found in textbooks.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes, unambiguous.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous Phrasing):** Excellent.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Units/Notation):** Excellent.
    *   **Overall:** A strong and clear question for testing ecological energy transfer.

*   **Actionable Feedback:** To improve uniqueness (Guideline 5), you could introduce an additional trophic level or a loss factor for unconsumed biomass.

**Question 3:**
<question>In a population of fruit flies, a gene for wing shape has two alleles, $W$ (wild-type) and $w$ (vestigial). Vestigial wings are recessive. In a sample of 1000 flies, 490 flies have wild-type wings, and 510 have vestigial wings. Assuming the population is not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, calculate the expected frequency of the heterozygous genotype ($Ww$) if the population were to reach Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with the current allele frequencies.</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Scenario):** Excellent. Classic population genetics application.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Excellent. Requires calculating allele frequencies from observed phenotypes (specifically recessive homozygotes) and then applying Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium principles.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Unique):** Good. The explicit statement about not being in HWE but asking for the *expected* equilibrium frequency with *current* allele frequencies is a good conceptual twist.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes, unambiguous.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous Phrasing):** Excellent.

**Question 4:**
<question>A cell undergoing meiosis has a total of 16 chromosomes at the beginning of prophase I. If *each* homologous pair undergoes precisely 2 crossing over events between non-sister chromatids, calculate the total number of recombinant chromosomes that will be produced at the end of meiosis II, assuming each chromosome separates successfully.</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Scenario):** Excellent. Focuses on meiosis and recombination.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, requires understanding chromosome number and crossover outcomes.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Unique):** Attempts to be unique by specifying "2 crossing over events."
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** **Fails.** The phrase "precisely 2 crossing over events between non-sister chromatids" is ambiguous without specifying the *type* of double crossover (e.g., two-strand, three-strand, or four-strand double crossover). Each type results in a different number of recombinant chromatids (0, 2, or 4 respectively). This ambiguity means there is no single correct numerical answer.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous Phrasing):** **Fails.** The phrasing for crossing over events is not rigorous enough for a precise calculation.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Units/Notation):** Good.
    *   **Overall:** A conceptually interesting question that is severely hampered by a critical ambiguity.

*   **Actionable Feedback:** To fix Guideline 6 and 7, revise the question to:
    1.  Specify the type of double crossover (e.g., "precisely two *four-strand* crossing over events").
    2.  Alternatively, simplify to a single crossing over event per homologous pair, which yields an unambiguous number of recombinant chromatids (2 per pair).

**Question 5:**
<question>An enzyme catalyzes a reaction with a Michaelis constant ($K_m$) of $5\,\mathrm{\mu M}$ and a maximum reaction velocity ($V_{max}$) of $60\,\mathrm{\mu mol/min}$. If a non-competitive inhibitor is added that reduces the $V_{max}$ by 25%, what is the reaction velocity, in $\mathrm{\mu mol/min}$, at a substrate concentration of $10\,\mathrm{\mu M}$?</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Scenario):** Excellent. Classic enzyme kinetics scenario.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Excellent. Requires understanding the effect of a non-competitive inhibitor on $V_{max}$ (and $K_m$) and then applying the Michaelis-Menten equation.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Unique):** Good. While Michaelis-Menten problems are common, incorporating a specific inhibitor type adds a good layer of complexity.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes, unambiguous.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous Phrasing):** Excellent.

**Question 6:**
<question>A plant cell with an initial solute potential ($\Psi_s$) of $-0.8\,\mathrm{MPa}$ is placed in a solution with a water potential ($\Psi_w$) of $-0.5\,\mathrm{MPa}$. If the cell's initial pressure potential ($\Psi_p$) is $0.2\,\mathrm{MPa}$, calculate the cell's pressure potential ($\Psi_p$) in $\mathrm{MPa}$ once it reaches equilibrium with the surrounding solution, assuming the solute potential of the cell remains constant.</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Scenario):** Excellent. Models water movement in plant cells.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Good. Requires applying the water potential equation and the concept of equilibrium. The initial cell's pressure potential is given but not strictly needed for the final equilibrium calculation, which is a good way to test discernment.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Unique):** Good, but this is a very common type of water potential problem.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes, unambiguous.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous Phrasing):** Excellent.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Units/Notation):** Excellent.
    *   **Overall:** A well-formulated and clear question.

*   **Actionable Feedback:** To enhance uniqueness (Guideline 5), you could introduce a scenario where the cell's solute potential changes slightly due to water movement, requiring an iterative or more complex solution (though this might push beyond typical assessment levels for some courses).

**Question 7:**
<question>A bacterial culture is inoculated with $10^3$ cells. After a 30-minute lag phase, the bacteria begin to divide by binary fission every 20 minutes. How many bacteria will be present after a total of 2 hours (including the lag phase), expressed in scientific notation as $a \times 10^b$? Give only the value of 'b' (the exponent).</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Scenario):** Excellent. Models bacterial growth.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Excellent. Requires calculating effective growth time, number of generations (potentially fractional), and final population.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Unique):** Good, but it's a standard bacterial growth problem.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes, unambiguous for the requested 'b' value, even with fractional generations. Both $10^3 \times 2^4$ and $10^3 \times 2^{4.5}$ result in numbers in the $10^4$ range, making 'b' equal to 4.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous Phrasing):** Good, but "divide by binary fission every 20 minutes" might imply discrete doubling, while the 4.5 generations suggest continuous exponential growth. This specific output constraint ("Give only the value of 'b'") cleverly mitigates the ambiguity for the final answer.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Units/Notation):** Excellent.
    *   **Overall:** A solid question, particularly clever with its output constraint.

*   **Actionable Feedback:** To remove potential ambiguity regarding discrete vs. continuous growth (Guideline 7), you could add "assume continuous exponential growth" if that is the intended calculation method for $2^{4.5}$.

**Question 9:**
<question>In a population of butterflies, wing color is determined by a single gene with two alleles: $C^B$ (black) and $C^W$ (white). Heterozygotes ($C^BC^W$) have gray wings. A sample of 500 butterflies reveals 320 black-winged butterflies, 160 gray-winged butterflies, and 20 white-winged butterflies. Calculate the frequency of the $C^B$ allele in this population.</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Scenario):** Excellent. Classic population genetics scenario with clear inheritance.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Excellent. Requires recognizing incomplete dominance for direct genotype-phenotype mapping, then counting alleles from the observed genotypes.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Unique):** Good. While allele frequency calculation is common, the explicit use of incomplete dominance to directly count alleles makes it a clean and effective variant.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes, unambiguous.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous Phrasing):** Excellent.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Units/Notation):** Excellent.
    *   **Overall:** A strong and clear question for testing allele frequency calculation.

*   **Actionable Feedback:** No significant changes needed.

**Question 10:**
<question>A researcher is studying a population of cells. The initial cell count is $1 \times 10^5$ cells/mL. After 48 hours, the cell count is $8 \times 10^5$ cells/mL. If a specific nutrient became limiting after 36 hours, reducing the growth rate by 50% for the remaining time, calculate the doubling time ($t_d$) of the cell population in hours *before* the nutrient limitation occurred.</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Scenario):** Outstanding. Models a complex and realistic cell growth scenario with changing conditions.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Outstanding. Requires parsing two distinct growth phases, understanding how nutrient limitation affects growth rate/doubling time, and solving an exponential growth problem across these phases.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Unique):** **Outstanding.** This is a highly novel and conceptually rich problem.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes, unambiguous (assuming standard interpretation of "reducing growth rate by 50%" means halving the growth rate constant, thus doubling the doubling time).
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous Phrasing):** Excellent.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Units/Notation):** Excellent.
    *   **Overall:** This is an exceptionally well-designed question.

*   **Actionable Feedback:** No changes needed. This question is a model example.

1.  <question>A researcher is studying a novel antibiotic. The minimum bacterial density for a successful infection is $1 \times 10^5$ cells/mL. If the initial bacterial density is $5 \times 10^6$ cells/mL and the antibiotic treatment leads to an exponential decay rate constant ($k$) of $0.05\, \mathrm{h^{-1}}$, calculate the minimum time, in hours, required for the bacterial population to fall below the infection threshold, assuming no new growth and that the decay starts after a 1-hour lag phase.</question>

2.  <question>In a closed ecosystem containing a plant species and a herbivore species, the plant's net primary productivity (NPP) is measured to be $5000\, \mathrm{kJ/m^2/year}$. The herbivore consumes $80\%$ of the NPP. Of the consumed energy, $20\%$ is assimilated and $80\%$ is egested. Assuming the herbivore's respiration accounts for $60\%$ of the *assimilated* energy, and a detritivore consumes 50% of the herbivore's egested waste, determine the secondary productivity (SP) of the herbivore population in $\mathrm{kJ/m^2/year}$.</question>

3.  <question>In a population of fruit flies, a gene for wing shape has two alleles, $W$ (wild-type) and $w$ (vestigial). Vestigial wings are recessive. In a sample of 1000 flies, 490 flies have wild-type wings, and 510 have vestigial wings. Assuming the population is not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, calculate the expected frequency of the heterozygous genotype ($Ww$) if the population were to reach Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with the current allele frequencies.</question>

4.  <question>A cell undergoing meiosis has a total of 16 chromosomes at the beginning of prophase I. If *each* homologous pair undergoes precisely one crossing over event between non-sister chromatids, calculate the total number of recombinant chromosomes that will be produced at the end of meiosis II, assuming each chromosome separates successfully.</question>

5.  <question>An enzyme catalyzes a reaction with a Michaelis constant ($K_m$) of $5\,\mathrm{\mu M}$ and a maximum reaction velocity ($V_{max}$) of $60\,\mathrm{\mu mol/min}$.

6.  <question>A plant cell with an initial solute potential ($\Psi_s$) of $-0.8\,\mathrm{MPa}$ is placed in a solution with a water potential ($\Psi_w$) of $-0.5\,\mathrm{MPa}$. If the cell's initial pressure potential ($\Psi_p$) is $0.2\,\mathrm{MPa}$, calculate the cell's pressure potential ($\Psi_p$) in $\mathrm{MPa}$ once it reaches equilibrium with the surrounding solution, assuming the solute potential of the cell *increases* by 0.1 MPa during the equilibration process.</question>

7.  <question>A bacterial culture is inoculated with $10^3$ cells. After a 30-minute lag phase, the bacteria begin to divide by binary fission every 20 minutes. Assuming continuous exponential growth, how many bacteria will be present after a total of 2 hours (including the lag phase), expressed in scientific notation as $a \times 10^b$? Give only the value of 'b' (the exponent).</question>

8.  <question>A species of fish exhibits temperature-dependent sex determination. Above $30\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$, all offspring are female, and below $25\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$, all offspring are male. If the average daily temperature of a breeding site is normally distributed with a mean of $27\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$ and a standard deviation of $2\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$, what is the probability, as a percentage, that *all* offspring produced on a given day will be female?</question>
