Here are some undergraduate-level biology questions based on the provided topics, key concepts, and guidelines:

1.  <question>A researcher is evaluating the effectiveness of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) combined with Nordic Walking (NW) on improving gait parameters in elderly subjects. Before intervention, a subject's arm swing was determined to have a mean angle of $\\theta = 15^{\circ}$ using Kinovea software analysis. After 6 weeks of combined RAS and NW therapy, the arm swing angle increased by 40%. Assuming arm swing angle is directly proportional to gait speed ($v$) such that $v = k \\theta$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality, by what percentage did the gait speed increase due to the therapy? </question>

2.  <question>During a study assessing gait and balance in patients with Parkinson's disease using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, researchers found that a patient took $t_1 = 15 \\,\\mathrm{seconds}$ to complete the TUG test without Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS). With RAS, the same patient completed the TUG test in $t_2 = 12 \\,\\mathrm{seconds}$. Assuming the distance covered in the TUG test ($d$) remained constant, what was the percentage increase in the patient's average speed ($v$) during the TUG test with RAS compared to without RAS? </question>

3.  <question>A study on the effects of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) on gait in stroke patients utilized the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA). Before RAS intervention, a patient exhibited a score decrease from the maximum of 30 due to impaired balance and coordination. After a 4-week RAS intervention, the same patient's FGA score improved by 20%. If the FGA score is directly proportional to the product of gait speed ($v$) and balance ($b$) such that $FGA = c \\cdot v \\cdot b$ where $c$ is a constant, by what factor did the product of gait speed and balance increase? </question>

4.  <question>Researchers are analyzing gait parameters in a group of individuals using Kinovea software. They observe that an individual's step length is $s_1 = 0.6 \\,\\mathrm{m}$ and cadence (steps per minute) is $c_1 = 100 \\,\\mathrm{steps/min}$ before Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS). After RAS, the step length increases to $s_2 = 0.7 \\,\\mathrm{m}$ and the cadence decreases to $c_2 = 95 \\,\\mathrm{steps/min}$. What is the change in gait speed from before to after RAS, in meters per second ($\\mathrm{m/s}$)? </question>

5.  <question>In a study comparing the effects of Nordic Walking (NW) and Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) on balance, researchers measure the sway area of participants during a static balance test. Before any intervention, the average sway area is $A_1 = 50 \\,\\mathrm{cm^2}$. After NW intervention, the sway area decreases by 15%, and after RAS intervention, the sway area decreases by an additional 10% relative to the *new* sway area post-NW. What is the final sway area $A_2$, in $\\mathrm{cm^2}$, after both interventions? </question>

Here's a critique of the provided biology questions based on your guidelines:

**Overall Assessment:**
The questions are generally very well-designed, effectively combining biological scenarios with quantitative reasoning. They demonstrate a strong adherence to most guidelines, particularly in modeling real-world biological situations, using rigorous phrasing, and demanding numerical answers. The use of LaTeX for mathematical notation is consistent and correct.

**Specific Feedback per Question:**

1.  **Question 1:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. The scenario is specific, realistic, and relevant to human gait analysis and interventions.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Good, but with a nuance. While it requires understanding direct proportionality and applying it to percentage changes, the calculation itself (if the proportionality is immediately grasped) is trivial (40% increase in angle implies 40% increase in speed). It primarily tests conceptual understanding of proportionality rather than complex multi-step computation. This is a valid assessment, but it might not be as computationally challenging as other questions.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Excellent. The proportionality relationship is clearly defined.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units/Symbols):** Excellent. Units are consistent, and symbols follow conventional notation.
    *   **Actionable Feedback:** The question is solid as is, but if the intent is to strictly force multiple *computational* steps, a scenario where the relationship is non-linear or where other variables interact might be considered for future questions. However, for testing proportionality, it's effective.

2.  **Question 2:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. The TUG test and Parkinson's disease context provide a strong, realistic biological application.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Excellent. This question clearly requires multiple steps: calculating initial speed, calculating final speed, and then determining the percentage increase. It also implicitly tests the understanding that distance is constant.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Excellent. The question is clear and unambiguous.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units/Symbols):** Excellent. Units are consistently handled and appropriate.
    *   **Actionable Feedback:** This question is very strong and aligns perfectly with all specified guidelines. No specific improvements are needed.

3.  **Question 3:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. The FGA score, stroke patients, and RAS intervention create a relevant and practical scenario.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Similar to Question 1, this question primarily tests the understanding of proportionality when applied to a product ($FGA \propto v \cdot b$). If the FGA score improves by 20%, the product $v \cdot b$ also increases by 20%, meaning the factor is 1.2. It's conceptually multi-step but computationally simple.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Excellent. The proportionality is clearly stated.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units/Symbols):** Excellent. Consistent and appropriate.
    *   **Actionable Feedback:** As with Question 1, it's a good conceptual check for understanding proportionality, but if the goal is demanding computational steps, consider modifying the relationship or introducing additional variables that require more complex calculation.

4.  **Question 4:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. The use of Kinovea software and specific gait parameters (step length, cadence) makes the scenario highly realistic and applicable.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Excellent. This question requires multiple distinct steps: understanding the formula for gait speed ($v = s \times c$), converting cadence units from steps/min to steps/second, calculating two different speeds, and then finding the difference.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Excellent. The question is clear and specifies the desired output unit.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units/Symbols):** Excellent. All units are consistently handled, and the target unit is specified in SI units ($\mathrm{m/s}$).
    *   **Actionable Feedback:** This is an outstanding question that perfectly meets all the specified guidelines. No improvements needed.

5.  **Question 5:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. The focus on balance, sway area, and sequential interventions (NW, RAS) is highly relevant to rehabilitation and exercise physiology.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Excellent. This question requires careful execution of sequential percentage changes, where the second percentage is applied to the *new* value after the first intervention. This is a common point of error and effectively tests multi-step reasoning.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Excellent. The phrase "relative to the *new* sway area post-NW" is crucial for clarity and ensures a single correct solution.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units/Symbols):** Excellent. Units are consistent and appropriate for the context ($\mathrm{cm^2}$).
    *   **Actionable Feedback:** This is another excellent question that fully adheres to all specified guidelines. No improvements needed.

**Final Summary:**
The set of questions is very strong. Questions 2, 4, and 5 are exemplary in their design, fulfilling all guidelines with precision. Questions 1 and 3 are also very good, particularly in their conceptual rigor and biological relevance, though the computational complexity is slightly less demanding if the proportionality concept is immediately grasped. Overall, this is a well-crafted set of assessment questions for undergraduate biology.

*Remember to ensure that when solutions are provided, they strictly follow the `\begin{aligned} ... \end{aligned}` LaTeX formatting requirement as stated in guideline 12.*

Okay, based on the feedback, I'll revise questions 1 and 3 to increase their computational complexity while retaining their biological relevance. The other questions were deemed strong and will be kept as is. Here are the revised questions:

1.  <question>A researcher is evaluating the effectiveness of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) combined with Nordic Walking (NW) on improving gait parameters in elderly subjects. Before intervention, a subject's arm swing was determined to have a mean angle of $\\theta = 15^{\circ}$ using Kinovea software analysis. After 6 weeks of combined RAS and NW therapy, the arm swing angle increased, following a logarithmic relationship, such that $\\theta_{new} = \\theta_{old} + A \\cdot ln(t+1)$, where $A = 5^{\circ}$ is a constant representing the effectiveness of the therapy and $t$ is the number of weeks of therapy. Assuming gait speed ($v$) is directly proportional to the *square root* of the arm swing angle ($v = k \\sqrt{\\theta}$), where $k$ is a constant of proportionality, by what percentage did the gait speed increase due to the therapy? </question>

2.  <question>During a study assessing gait and balance in patients with Parkinson's disease using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, researchers found that a patient took $t_1 = 15 \\,\\mathrm{seconds}$ to complete the TUG test without Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS). With RAS, the same patient completed the TUG test in $t_2 = 12 \\,\\mathrm{seconds}$. Assuming the distance covered in the TUG test ($d$) remained constant, what was the percentage increase in the patient's average speed ($v$) during the TUG test with RAS compared to without RAS? </question>

3.  <question>A study on the effects of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) on gait in stroke patients utilized the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA). Before RAS intervention, a patient exhibited a score of $FGA_1 = 20$ (out of a maximum of 30) due to impaired balance and coordination. After a 4-week RAS intervention, the patient's FGA score improved. The FGA score is related to gait speed ($v$) and balance ($b$) such that $FGA = c \\cdot v^2 \\cdot \\sqrt{b}$ where $c$ is a constant.  If the patient's balance ($b$) improves by 10% due to the intervention, what is the percentage increase in gait speed ($v$) after the RAS intervention, given that the new FGA score is $FGA_2 = 25$? </question>

4.  <question>Researchers are analyzing gait parameters in a group of individuals using Kinovea software. They observe that an individual's step length is $s_1 = 0.6 \\,\\mathrm{m}$ and cadence (steps per minute) is $c_1 = 100 \\,\\mathrm{steps/min}$ before Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS). After RAS, the step length increases to $s_2 = 0.7 \\,\\mathrm{m}$ and the cadence decreases to $c_2 = 95 \\,\\mathrm{steps/min}$. What is the change in gait speed from before to after RAS, in meters per second ($\\mathrm{m/s}$)? </question>

5.  <question>In a study comparing the effects of Nordic Walking (NW) and Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) on balance, researchers measure the sway area of participants during a static balance test. Before any intervention, the average sway area is $A_1 = 50 \\,\\mathrm{cm^2}$. After NW intervention, the sway area decreases by 15%, and after RAS intervention, the sway area decreases by an additional 10% relative to the *new* sway area post-NW. What is the final sway area $A_2$, in $\\mathrm{cm^2}$, after both interventions? </question>

Okay, given the overwhelmingly positive feedback and specific comments about the strengths of the previous questions, the strategy will be to very subtly refine the existing questions, focusing primarily on making the narrative context even *slightly* richer and ensuring absolute clarity.  No changes will be made that fundamentally alter the core mathematical or biological principles being tested, as the existing structure is already highly effective.  The primary goal is to ensure they are as engaging and clear as possible.

1.  <question>A geriatric rehabilitation specialist is investigating the effects of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) during Nordic Walking (NW) exercises on improving gait in older adults.  Baseline arm swing was quantified using Kinovea motion capture software, revealing a mean angle of $\\theta = 15^{\circ}$.  After a six-week RAS+NW intervention, the arm swing angle improved, following a logarithmic progression modeled as $\\theta_{new} = \\theta_{old} + A \\cdot ln(t+1)$, where $A = 5^{\circ}$ represents the therapy's effectiveness coefficient and $t$ is the number of weeks of therapy.  If gait speed ($v$) is directly proportional to the *square root* of the arm swing angle ($v = k \\sqrt{\\theta}$), where $k$ is a constant of proportionality, what is the percentage increase in gait speed attributable to the RAS+NW intervention?</question>

2.  <question>Neurologists are evaluating the efficacy of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) in alleviating motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. Using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, a patient initially required $t_1 = 15 \\,\\mathrm{seconds}$ to complete the task without RAS. With RAS, the same patient's TUG completion time decreased to $t_2 = 12 \\,\\mathrm{seconds}$. Assuming the TUG test covers a fixed distance ($d$), calculate the percentage increase in the patient's average speed ($v$) during the TUG test when using RAS, compared to the unassisted trial.</question>

3.  <question>Researchers are studying the impact of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) on rehabilitating gait function in stroke survivors, using the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) as a primary outcome measure.  Prior to RAS therapy, a patient scored $FGA_1 = 20$ (out of 30), indicating significant impairments in balance and coordination.  Following a 4-week RAS intervention, the patient's FGA score improved to $FGA_2 = 25$. The FGA score is modeled as a function of gait speed ($v$) and balance ($b$) according to the equation $FGA = c \\cdot v^2 \\cdot \\sqrt{b}$, where $c$ is a proportionality constant.  If the intervention resulted in a 10% improvement in the patient's balance ($b$), determine the percentage increase in gait speed ($v$) as a result of the RAS therapy.</question>

4.  <question>Kinesiologists are using Kinovea software to analyze gait characteristics in a cohort of participants before and after Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS). An individual's baseline gait is characterized by a step length of $s_1 = 0.6 \\,\\mathrm{m}$ and a cadence of $c_1 = 100 \\,\\mathrm{steps/min}$.  Following RAS treatment, their step length increases to $s_2 = 0.7 \\,\\mathrm{m}$, while their cadence decreases slightly to $c_2 = 95 \\,\\mathrm{steps/min}$.  Quantify the change in gait speed, in meters per second ($\\mathrm{m/s}$), resulting from the RAS intervention.</question>

5.  <question>A physical therapy research team is comparing the effects of Nordic Walking (NW) and Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) on postural stability. Participants underwent static balance testing, and their initial average sway area was measured as $A_1 = 50 \\,\\mathrm{cm^2}$. The NW intervention reduced the sway area by 15%. Subsequently, RAS was applied, leading to a further 10% reduction in sway area, calculated *relative to the sway area achieved after the NW intervention*.  Calculate the final sway area $A_2$, in $\\mathrm{cm^2}$, after both the NW and RAS interventions.</question>
