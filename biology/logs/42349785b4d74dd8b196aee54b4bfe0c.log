=== Turn 0: Critic feedback ===
Here is a critique of your biology questions, evaluated against your provided guidelines:

---

**Question 1:**
<question>
A population of *Daphnia magna* in a laboratory culture initially contains 100 individuals. The intrinsic rate of natural increase, $r$, for this population under ideal conditions is $0.25\,\mathrm{day^{-1}}$. Assuming exponential growth, how many *Daphnia* will there be after 7 days, rounded to the nearest whole number?
</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** This question primarily tests the application of a single, straightforward formula ($N_t = N_0 e^{rt}$). While it involves understanding exponential growth, it doesn't require significant multi-step *reasoning* or the integration of diverse biological principles beyond recalling the formula.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** This is a very common, textbook example of exponential population growth calculation. It lacks novelty.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To improve, introduce a more complex scenario. For instance, combine exponential growth with resource limitation after a certain point, or ask about the rate of change at a specific time given a carrying capacity, thereby forcing more nuanced calculation or conceptual application beyond a direct formula plug-in.

---

**Question 2:**
<question>
In a closed ecosystem, a primary producer synthesizes glucose from carbon dioxide and water at a rate of $5\,\mathrm{mg}$ glucose per hour. If the respiratory rate of this producer consumes $2\,\mathrm{mg}$ glucose per hour, what is the net primary productivity (NPP) in $\mathrm{mg}$ glucose per day?
</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** While requiring two steps (calculation of NPP from GPP and respiration, then unit conversion), this is a fairly standard calculation of Net Primary Productivity. It doesn't present a highly novel scenario.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Consider a scenario where NPP is inferred from multiple interdependent processes, or where efficiency losses are involved, making the calculation less direct. For example, "If 20% of the glucose produced is lost to non-respiratory metabolic processes, what is the available energy for the next trophic level, given these rates?"

---

**Question 3:**
<question>
A plant cell is placed in a solution with a water potential of $-0.6\,\mathrm{MPa}$. The plant cell has a solute potential of $-0.8\,\mathrm{MPa}$ and a pressure potential of $0.2\,\mathrm{MPa}$. What is the water potential gradient between the cell and the solution, in $\mathrm{MPa}$, and will water enter or exit the cell? Provide the absolute value of water potential gradient.
</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 2 (Expect answers of single word/numerical answer):** This question asks for two types of answers: a numerical value (gradient) and a directional word answer (enter/exit).
    *   **Guideline 10 (Questions must not be multipart):** This question explicitly asks for two separate pieces of information (the gradient AND the direction of water movement), making it multipart. The phrasing "Provide the absolute value of water potential gradient" also makes the first part slightly redundant if direction is also asked, as the sign of the gradient typically indicates direction.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Split this into two distinct questions if both pieces of information are critical, or rephrase to ask for a single target quantity. For example, "Given these conditions, what is the net water potential of the plant cell?" or "In which direction will water move (into or out of the cell)?"

---

**Question 4:**
<question>
A population of bacteria doubles every 20 minutes. If a culture starts with an initial population density of $1 \times 10^3$ cells per mL, what will the population density be (in cells/mL) after 2 hours, assuming unlimited resources and exponential growth? Report your answer in scientific notation using one decimal place.
</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** This is a fundamental and very common problem involving doubling time for exponential growth. It's conceptually similar to Question 1 but uses a different growth parameter. It lacks novelty.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To enhance uniqueness, integrate this growth into a larger system. For example, ask about the time until a certain resource (e.g., nutrient concentration) falls below a critical level due to bacterial consumption, or calculate the *rate* of oxygen consumption at a specific time point given the population density.

---

**Question 5:**
<question>
An enzyme catalyzes a reaction with a Michaelis constant ($K_m$) of $5\,\mathrm{mM}$. If the initial substrate concentration is $15\,\mathrm{mM}$, what percentage of the enzyme's maximum velocity ($V_{max}$) will be observed?
</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** This is a classic and very common calculation based on the Michaelis-Menten equation. It is a direct application of the formula and does not present a novel scenario.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To improve uniqueness and multi-step reasoning, introduce concepts like competitive or non-competitive inhibition, or ask how $K_m$ or $V_{max}$ would change under altered physiological conditions (e.g., pH, temperature) and then require a subsequent calculation. For example, "If an inhibitor reduces the observed velocity by 20% under these conditions, what is the concentration of the inhibitor, assuming it's a competitive inhibitor with a given $K_i$?"

---

**Question 6:**
<question>
A hypothetical mRNA sequence is 5'-AUGCCGUAAUGA-3'. Assuming standard codon translation in eukaryotes, how many amino acids will be in the resulting polypeptide chain? Include the start codon in your count but not the stop codon.
</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** This is a very common, almost rote, exercise in identifying start/stop codons and counting amino acids in a simple mRNA sequence. It lacks novelty.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To make it more unique and challenging, introduce complexities such as frameshift mutations, nonsense mutations, or ask about the impact of a specific mutation on the resulting protein. Alternatively, provide a longer sequence and ask about a specific characteristic of the polypeptide (e.g., "how many non-polar amino acids would be present?" - requiring a genetic code table and more careful counting).

---

**Question 7:**
<question>
Two parents, both heterozygous for a recessive genetic disorder, have a child. What is the probability that this child will be a carrier (heterozygous) for the disorder? Provide your answer as a decimal.
</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** This is the most fundamental and ubiquitous problem in Mendelian genetics (a monohybrid cross probability). It is extremely common and therefore not unique.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To significantly improve uniqueness and force more complex reasoning, introduce non-Mendelian inheritance patterns (e.g., incomplete dominance, codominance, sex-linked traits, multiple alleles), or require interpretation of a pedigree spanning multiple generations, or involve linkage or gene interactions.

---

**Question 8:**
<question>
A sample of lake water has a pH of 6.0. A second sample has a pH of 8.0. How many times more alkaline is the second sample compared to the first?
</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** While requiring an understanding of the logarithmic nature of the pH scale, this is a standard calculation often found in introductory chemistry or biology contexts. It lacks novelty in its application.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Consider embedding the pH change within a more complex biological scenario. For instance, "If an algal bloom causes the pH of a pond to change from 6.0 to 8.0 over a week, how much would the hydrogen ion concentration decrease, and what would be the likely impact on a population of fish sensitive to pH changes?" – thereby integrating biological consequence or asking for a related chemical quantity.

---

**Question 9:**
<question>
A marine ecologist measures the salinity of seawater to be 35 practical salinity units (PSU). If the density of the seawater is approximately $1.028\,\mathrm{g/mL}$, what is the approximate mass of salt (in grams) present in 1 liter of this seawater?
</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Overall:** This is a strong question that adheres well to all guidelines. It models a relevant biological scenario (marine ecology), forces multi-step reasoning (converting PSU, using density, and then calculating mass), has a single numerical solution, uses consistent units, and is quite unique in its application of these principles in a biological context.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** No major improvements needed. This question serves as a good example of how to combine physical reasoning with a biological scenario.

---

**Question 10:**
<question>
In a food chain, phytoplankton are consumed by zooplankton, which are consumed by small fish, which are consumed by larger fish. If the trophic efficiency is 10% at each level, and the phytoplankton have a biomass of $1000\,\mathrm{kg}$, what is the biomass of the larger fish in $\mathrm{kg}$?
</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** This is a very common and fundamental problem illustrating energy transfer in a trophic pyramid. It's a staple of introductory ecology.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To enhance uniqueness and complexity, add another layer of calculation or conceptual understanding. For example, introduce different efficiencies at different trophic levels, or ask about the *total energy* required by the top predator over a year, given their metabolic rates and an initial energy input at the producer level. Or, ask about the *area* of producer biomass needed to sustain the top consumer, given a certain productivity per unit area.
=== Turn 1: Author refines questions ===
Okay, here's the revised set of biology questions, incorporating the feedback provided. I've focused on making the questions more unique, requiring multi-step reasoning, and ensuring they are not multi-part (where applicable).

```xml
<question>
A population of *Daphnia magna* in a laboratory culture initially contains 100 individuals.

</question>

<question>
A population of bacteria doubles every 20 minutes. The bacteria are grown in a nutrient broth where the initial concentration of glucose is 10 g/L.

Round your answer to the nearest whole number.
</question>

<question>

</question>

<question>

</question>

<question>

</question>

<question>
A sample of lake water has a pH of 6.0. An algal bloom then occurs, changing the pH to 8.0. If a fish species requires a hydrogen ion concentration between $5 \times 10^{-7}$ M and $2 \times 10^{-6}$ M to survive, will the fish survive after the algal bloom? Answer "yes" or "no".

Round your answer to the nearest whole number.
</question>
```
=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of your revised set of biology questions, evaluated against your guidelines:

---

**1. Question: *Daphnia* Population Growth**
```xml
<question>
A population of *Daphnia magna* in a laboratory culture initially contains 100 individuals. The intrinsic rate of natural increase, $r$, for this population under ideal conditions is $0.25\,\mathrm{day^{-1}}$. The carrying capacity of the culture is estimated to be 2000 individuals. Assuming logistic growth, approximate the population growth rate (number of *Daphnia* added per day) on day 5? Round your answer to the nearest whole number.
</question>
```
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** This question implicitly requires solving the integrated logistic growth equation for N(t) to find the population size on day 5, and then plugging that N into the differential equation for $dN/dt$. While multi-step, the calculation of N(5) from the integrated form ($N(t) = K / (1 + ((K-N_0)/N_0)e^{-rt})$) is mathematically complex for a general biology assessment without specialized calculators or prior derivation. If simpler iterative calculation (e.g., Euler's method for discrete steps) is intended, it should be specified. If continuous solution is expected, ensure students have the tools/background.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Clarify the expected method for calculating population size at a specific time (e.g., "assuming continuous logistic growth and allowing for calculator use for exponential calculations" or "assuming daily discrete logistic steps, approximate...").

---

**2. Question: Ecosystem Energy Transfer**
```xml
<question>
In a closed ecosystem, a primary producer synthesizes glucose from carbon dioxide and water at a rate of $5\,\mathrm{mg}$ glucose per hour. If the respiratory rate of this producer consumes $2\,\mathrm{mg}$ glucose per hour, and 20% of the glucose produced is allocated to non-respiratory biomass increase, what is the daily energy available for the next trophic level (in Joules), assuming 1 mg of glucose yields 15 Joules of energy upon consumption? Round your answer to the nearest whole number.
</question>
```
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** The phrasing creates ambiguity regarding what "energy available for the next trophic level" refers to. It could be interpreted as Net Primary Production (GPP - Respiration = 3 mg/hr), or *only* the portion explicitly stated as "allocated to non-respiratory biomass increase" (20% of GPP = 1 mg/hr). The respiration rate becomes a distractor if the latter is intended, which is fine for uniqueness but the question must be unambiguous.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Rephrase to explicitly state which energy fraction is available for the next trophic level. For example, "what is the daily energy (in Joules) stored as biomass and thus available for consumption by the next trophic level?" This clarifies that the 20% of glucose produced is the relevant quantity.

---

**3. Question: Plant Cell Water Movement**
```xml
<question>
A plant cell is placed in a solution with a water potential of $-0.6\,\mathrm{MPa}$. The plant cell has a solute potential of $-0.8\,\mathrm{MPa}$ and a pressure potential of $0.2\,\mathrm{MPa}$. In which direction will water move (into or out of the cell)?
</question>
```
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution) & 2 (Expected Answer):** Calculating the cell's water potential: $\Psi_{\text{cell}} = \Psi_s + \Psi_p = -0.8\,\mathrm{MPa} + 0.2\,\mathrm{MPa} = -0.6\,\mathrm{MPa}$. Since the cell's water potential is equal to the solution's water potential (both -0.6 MPa), there will be no net movement of water. The question forces a choice between "into" or "out of", which is problematic when "no net movement" is the correct biological outcome.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Adjust one of the water potential values slightly to ensure a net movement, or include "no net movement" as a valid answer option, e.g., "into, out of, or no net movement?"

---

**4. Question: Bacterial Glucose Consumption**
```xml
<question>
A population of bacteria doubles every 20 minutes. The bacteria are grown in a nutrient broth where the initial concentration of glucose is 10 g/L. Assume that each bacterial cell consumes $10^{-12}$ g of glucose per doubling. If the culture starts with an initial population density of $1 \times 10^3$ cells per mL, approximately how long (in minutes) will it take for the glucose concentration to drop to 1 g/L? Round your answer to the nearest whole number.
</question>
```
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing) & 6 (Single Solution):** The problem setup is missing a critical piece of information: the total volume of the bacterial culture. You provide glucose concentration (g/L) and initial population density (cells/mL), but to calculate the total mass of glucose consumed, you need the absolute volume. Without a specified volume, the total glucose to be consumed is undefined, leading to an unsolvable problem. (Implicitly, if one assumes a 1-Liter volume, the calculation is possible, but this needs to be stated).
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Specify the total volume of the culture (e.g., "in a 1-Liter culture" or "in a 500 mL culture").

---

**5. Question: Enzyme Kinetics with Inhibition**
```xml
<question>
An enzyme catalyzes a reaction with a Michaelis constant ($K_m$) of $5\,\mathrm{mM}$. If the initial substrate concentration is $15\,\mathrm{mM}$, and a competitive inhibitor with a $K_i$ of $2\,\mathrm{mM}$ is present at a concentration of $1\,\mathrm{mM}$, what percentage of the enzyme's maximum velocity ($V_{max}$) will be observed?
</question>
```
*   **Critique:** This question is **excellent**. It models a biological scenario, requires multi-step reasoning (calculating apparent Km, then applying Michaelis-Menten), is unique in its specific values, yields a single solution, and is rigorously phrased.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** None.

---

**6. Question: mRNA Mutation and Polypeptide Length**
```xml
<question>
A hypothetical mRNA sequence is 5'-AUGCCGUAAUGA-3'. Suppose a mutation occurs, changing the sequence to 5'-AUGCCGUAGUGA-3'. How many amino acids will be in the resulting polypeptide chain, assuming standard codon translation in eukaryotes and including the start codon if it is present?
</question>
```
*   **Critique:** This question is **excellent**. It effectively tests understanding of mRNA translation, start/stop codons, and the impact of specific mutations. The specific mutation (stop codon to a different stop codon) requires careful attention, making it unique.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** None.

---

**7. Question: Probability in Genetics**
```xml
<question>
Two parents, both heterozygous for a recessive genetic disorder, have three children. What is the probability that exactly two of these three children will be carriers (heterozygous) for the disorder? Provide your answer as a decimal rounded to three decimal places.
</question>
```
*   **Critique:** This question is **excellent**. It combines Mendelian genetics (determining individual probability) with binomial probability, requiring multi-step reasoning. It's clearly phrased and yields a single numerical answer.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** None.

---

**8. Question: pH and Fish Survival**
```xml
<question>
A sample of lake water has a pH of 6.0. An algal bloom then occurs, changing the pH to 8.0. If a fish species requires a hydrogen ion concentration between $5 \times 10^{-7}$ M and $2 \times 10^{-6}$ M to survive, will the fish survive after the algal bloom? Answer "yes" or "no".
</question>
```
*   **Critique:** This question is **excellent**. It applies the definition of pH to a real-world ecological scenario, requiring calculation of hydrogen ion concentration and comparison to a given range. It's concise and clear.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** None.

---

**9. Question: Salinity and Mass of Salt**
```xml
<question>
A marine ecologist measures the salinity of seawater to be 35 practical salinity units (PSU). If the density of the seawater is approximately $1.028\,\mathrm{g/mL}$, what is the approximate mass of salt (in grams) present in 1 liter of this seawater?
</question>
```
*   **Critique:** This question is **excellent**. It models a realistic scenario, requires understanding of PSU (which is grams per kilogram), density, and unit conversions. It's multi-step and leads to a clear numerical answer.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** None.

---

**10. Question: Trophic Efficiency and Survival Time**
```xml
<question>
In a food chain, phytoplankton are consumed by zooplankton, which are consumed by small fish, which are consumed by larger fish. If the trophic efficiency is 10% at each level, and the phytoplankton have a biomass of $1000\,\mathrm{kg}$, and the large fish require a minimum of 1 kg/day to survive, how many days can the large fish survive if they depend *only* on this food chain? Round your answer to the nearest whole number.
</question>
```
*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** The phrase "the large fish require a minimum of 1 kg/day to survive" is slightly ambiguous. Does it refer to a single individual large fish, or the collective biomass of all large fish supported by the food chain? Given the final calculated biomass of large fish (1 kg), it implies a singular "the large fish" in a conceptual sense. Clarifying this would improve precision.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Rephrase to clarify if the 1 kg/day requirement is for an individual large fish (and thus how many such fish can be supported), or if it refers to the total daily consumption rate of the supported biomass of large fish. For example: "how many days can the total biomass of large fish supported by this food chain sustain itself if its collective daily requirement is 1 kg/day?"

---

**Summary:**

Overall, this is a significantly improved set of questions. They largely meet your stated guidelines, particularly in requiring multi-step reasoning, modeling biological scenarios, and avoiding simple "how" questions. The uniqueness is also strong. The feedback provided is primarily about addressing minor ambiguities or missing implicit information to ensure a single, unambiguous solution and clear interpretation for the student.
