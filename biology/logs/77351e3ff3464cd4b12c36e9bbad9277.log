Here are some novel, undergraduate-level biology questions based on your specified topics, key concepts, and guidelines:

<question>
A researcher investigates the circulation dynamics of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) loaded with mRNA in mice after intravenous injection. They find that the concentration of intact LNPs in the blood decreases exponentially, with a half-life of 7 days. After 21 days, what percentage of the originally injected LNPs remain circulating in the bloodstream?
</question>

<question>
A study examines the relationship between anti-PEG antibody levels and mRNA clearance in vaccinated individuals. Group A has an average anti-PEG antibody titer of 1:1000, while Group B has a titer of 1:10000. Despite the tenfold difference in anti-PEG antibodies, both groups exhibit the same mRNA decay rate constant of $k = 0.02 \, \mathrm{h^{-1}}$. Assuming first-order kinetics, calculate the time (in hours) it takes for the mRNA concentration to decrease to 25% of its initial value in both groups.
</question>

<question>
Two groups of vaccinated individuals are compared. Group X shows high levels of blood mRNA at 24 hours post-vaccination (mean mRNA copies/mL: $5 \times 10^5$), while Group Y exhibits significantly lower levels (mean mRNA copies/mL: $5 \times 10^3$). Despite this difference, both groups develop comparable anti-spike IgG titers of $10^4$ ELISA units/mL and neutralizing antibody titers of 1:500. If the average molecular weight of IgG is $150 \, \mathrm{kDa}$, estimate the total mass of anti-spike IgG (in grams) present in 5 liters of plasma from Group X.
</question>

<question>
In an in vitro experiment, monocytes are incubated with nanoparticles.  At a concentration of $1 \, \mathrm{mg/mL}$ of nanoparticles, the phagocytosis rate by monocytes is $80\%$. A separate experiment measures anti-PEG antibody production in the same context.  When monocyte phagocytosis is artificially reduced to $40\%$ (half the original rate), anti-PEG antibody levels increase by a factor of 2.5. If the baseline anti-PEG antibody level at $80\%$ phagocytosis is $20 \, \mathrm{ng/mL}$, what is the anti-PEG antibody level (in $\mathrm{ng/mL}$) when monocyte phagocytosis is at $40\%$?
</question>

<question>
A researcher investigates the clearance of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) by macrophages in the spleen. They find that $60\%$ of injected LNPs are cleared within the first 24 hours.  If the initial injected dose is $50 \, \mu\mathrm{g}$ of LNPs, and the average LNP contains $1000$ mRNA molecules, calculate the number of mRNA molecules cleared by splenic macrophages within the first 24 hours. Assume all cleared LNPs are completely processed and their mRNA content is degraded. Express your answer in scientific notation.

If the average molecular weight of IgG is $150 \, \mathrm{kDa}$, estimate the total mass of anti-spike IgG (in grams) present in $5$ liters of plasma from Group X.
</question>
**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Biology Scenario):** Good. Models a relevant comparative study in vaccinated individuals.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Good. Expects a numerical answer in grams.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Major Issue.** The question is currently unsolvable. It requires converting "ELISA units/mL" to a quantifiable mass or molar concentration of IgG. ELISA units are a relative measure (titer) and do not directly translate to absolute mass without a standard curve or an explicit conversion factor (e.g., "$10^4$ ELISA units/mL corresponds to $X \, \mu\mathrm{g/mL}$ of IgG"), which is missing. The other information (mRNA levels, neutralizing titers) is irrelevant distractors but the core conversion is absent.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based):** It's intended as a calculation but is unanswerable.
*   **Guideline 5 (Unique):** Good. The combination of data types is novel.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** **Fail.** The question is unsolvable due to missing information.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Good phrasing, but the missing information makes it unrigorous for a quantitative problem.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units/Notation):** Good. Units are stated, but the lack of a conversion factor makes them unusable for the final calculation.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):** Good. Focuses on a single target quantity.
*   **Guideline 11 (Solution Formatting - in Q):** Excellent. All numbers, variables, and units are correctly formatted.
*   **Guideline 12 (Multi-Step Equations):** N/A for question text.
**Actionable Feedback:**
*   **Critical:** The question is currently unsolvable. To make it solvable, you must provide a conversion factor that allows the student to convert "ELISA units/mL" into an absolute mass concentration (e.g., $\mathrm{\mu g/mL}$ or $\mathrm{nM}$) of IgG.
    *   **Example Correction:** "If Group X has an anti-spike IgG concentration of $10 \, \mathrm{\mu g/mL}$ (corresponding to their $10^4$ ELISA units/mL titer), estimate the total mass..." (This would remove the ambiguity of ELISA units and make it a direct calculation.)

</question>
**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Biology Scenario):** Good. Models an in vitro experiment studying immune cell interactions with nanoparticles.
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Good. Expects a numerical answer in $\mathrm{ng/mL}$.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Good. Requires identifying the relevant information and performing a direct multiplication. It includes appropriate distractors (nanoparticle concentration, baseline phagocytosis rate) to test careful reading.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based):** Good. Asks for a calculation, no hints.
*   **Guideline 5 (Unique):** Good. The scenario involving manipulating phagocytosis and observing antibody levels is a novel application of quantitative reasoning.

<question>
A researcher investigates the clearance of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) by macrophages in the spleen. They find that $60\%$ of injected LNPs are cleared within the first $24$ hours. If the initial injected dose is $50 \, \mu\mathrm{g}$ of LNPs, and the average LNP contains $1000$ mRNA molecules, calculate the number of mRNA molecules cleared by splenic macrophages within the first $24$ hours. Assume all cleared LNPs are completely processed and their mRNA content is degraded. Express your answer in scientific notation.
</question>
**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Biology Scenario):** Good. Models a relevant biological process (LNP clearance by macrophages).
*   **Guideline 2 (Answer Type):** Good. Expects a numerical answer in scientific notation.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Major Issue.** The question is currently unsolvable. It provides the total mass of LNPs ($\mu\mathrm{g}$) and the number of mRNA molecules per LNP, but it does *not* provide a way to convert the total mass of LNPs into the total *number* of LNPs. To do this, one would need either the average mass of a single LNP particle or a conversion factor (e.g., number of LNPs per $\mu\mathrm{g}$). This critical piece of information is missing.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based):** It's intended as a calculation but is unanswerable.
*   **Guideline 5 (Unique):** Good. The scenario is specific and novel.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** **Fail.** The question is unsolvable due to missing information.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Good phrasing, but the missing information makes it unrigorous for a quantitative problem.

*   **Guideline 12 (Multi-Step Equations):** N/A for question text.
**Actionable Feedback:**
*   **Critical:** The question is currently unsolvable. To make it solvable, you must provide a conversion factor between the mass of LNPs and the number of LNPs.
    *   **Example Correction:** "If the initial injected dose is $50 \, \mu\mathrm{g}$ of LNPs, and there are an average of $10^{10}$ LNPs per $\mu\mathrm{g}$, and the average LNP contains $1000$ mRNA molecules, calculate the number of mRNA molecules cleared..." (This adds the necessary conversion factor).

</question>
=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of each question against your guidelines, with specific, actionable feedback for improvement:

---

**Question 1 Critique:**

*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Yes, a relevant scenario involving LNP pharmacokinetics.
*   **2. Expect numerical answer:** Yes, a percentage.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes, involves understanding half-life, calculating the number of half-lives, and applying exponential decay. This is 2-3 steps.
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** Yes, it's a calculation.
*   **5. Be Unique:** Yes, applies a common principle to a specific, contemporary biological context (LNPs with mRNA).
*   **6. Single Solution:** Yes.
*   **7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** Yes, clear and professional.
*   **9. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional biology notation:** Units are consistent.
*   **10. Questions must not be multipart:** Yes, single target quantity.
*   **11. Solution Formatting:** (Applies to solution, not question, but checking inline math).

**Feedback:**
This is a strong question. The scenario is realistic and the calculation directly tests understanding of exponential decay and half-life.

**Minor LaTeX/Formatting Improvement:**
*   For consistency in LaTeX, numerical values with units should ideally be grouped together in math mode with `\mathrm{}` for the units.
    *   Change `$7$ days` to `$7 \, \mathrm{days}$`.
    *   Change `$21$ days` to `$21 \, \mathrm{days}$`.

---

**Question 2 Critique:**

*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Yes, explores mRNA clearance in vaccinated individuals and the potential (or lack thereof) influence of antibody levels.
*   **2. Expect numerical answer:** Yes, time in hours.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes, requires recalling/applying the first-order decay equation and solving for time. The inclusion of differing antibody titers that *do not* affect the decay rate constant is an excellent distractor, forcing students to identify relevant information. This tests deeper conceptual understanding beyond just computation.
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** Yes, it's a calculation.
*   **5. Be Unique:** Yes, the scenario with the relevant distractor is quite unique and well-designed.
*   **6. Single Solution:** Yes.
*   **7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** Yes, clear and precise.
*   **9. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional biology notation:** All units (`$h^{-1}$`, `%`) and notation are correct and consistent.
*   **10. Questions must not be multipart:** Yes, single target quantity.
*   **11. Solution Formatting:** (Applies to solution, not question, but checking inline math).

**Feedback:**
An excellent question. The distractor significantly elevates the cognitive demand and assesses critical evaluation of information.

**Minor LaTeX/Formatting Improvement:**
*   Consider ensuring numerical values are always in math mode:
    *   `$1:1000$` and `$1:10000$` are fine as ratios, but `anti-PEG antibody titer of $1:1000$` could be `anti-PEG antibody titer of $1:1000$`. The existing format is acceptable.

---

**Question 3 Critique:**

*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Yes, comparing vaccinated groups with different mRNA levels but similar antibody responses, then focusing on an antibody quantification.
*   **2. Expect numerical answer:** Yes, mass in grams.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes, requires unit conversions (e.g., $\mu\mathrm{g/mL}$ to $\mathrm{g/L}$ or total mass) and multiplication by volume. The initial comparison of groups X and Y with their various data points acts as a distractor, directing the student to only the relevant information for the final calculation. This is well-executed.
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** Yes, it's a calculation.
*   **5. Be Unique:** Yes, integrates multiple biological data types, some serving as distractors, into a quantitative problem.
*   **6. Single Solution:** Yes.
*   **7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** Yes, clear and detailed.
*   **9. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional biology notation:** Units are generally consistent.
*   **10. Questions must not be multipart:** Yes, single target quantity.
*   **11. Solution Formatting:** (Applies to solution, not question, but checking inline math).

**Feedback:**
Another excellent question. The use of distractors (mRNA levels, other antibody titers, Group Y data) is very effective in assessing a student's ability to filter information and apply specific data to a problem.

**Minor LaTeX/Formatting Improvements:**
*   For units and quantities:
    *   Change `$5$ liters` to `$5 \, \mathrm{L}$`.
    *   Change `(in grams)` to `(in $\mathrm{g}$)`.
    *   `$10 \, \mathrm{\mu g/mL}$` is correctly formatted.
    *   `$150 \, \mathrm{kDa}$` is correctly formatted.
    *   `$5 \times 10^5$` and `$5 \times 10^3$` are correctly formatted.

---

**Question 4 Critique:**

*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Yes, an in vitro experiment examining the interplay between phagocytosis and antibody production.
*   **2. Expect numerical answer:** Yes, antibody level in $\mathrm{ng/mL}$.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** **Area for improvement.** While it involves a biological concept (phagocytosis-antibody relationship), the calculation itself is a single, direct multiplication ($20 \, \mathrm{ng/mL} \times 2.5$). This doesn't strongly "Force Multi-Step Reasoning" or require "two or more biological principles or steps" in the same way the other questions do. It primarily tests reading comprehension and a very basic arithmetic operation.
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** Yes, it's a calculation.
*   **5. Be Unique:** The scenario itself is unique.
*   **6. Single Solution:** Yes.
*   **7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** Yes, clear.
*   **9. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional biology notation:** All units (`$\mathrm{mg/mL}$`, `$\%$`, `$\mathrm{ng/mL}$`) are correct and consistent.
*   **10. Questions must not be multipart:** Yes, single target quantity.
*   **11. Solution Formatting:** (Applies to solution, not question, but checking inline math).

**Feedback:**
The scenario is interesting, but the question is too simplistic regarding the calculation. It needs to be more challenging to meet guideline #3.

**Recommendation for Improvement:**
To force multi-step reasoning, consider:
*   **Introduce a non-linear relationship:** Instead of a direct factor, provide data points for multiple phagocytosis levels and ask for a level that requires interpolation or fitting a simple curve.
*   **Ask for a rate or a concentration change over time:** For example, given the antibody production rate at $80\%$ phagocytosis, and how the rate changes when phagocytosis is $40\%$, calculate the antibody concentration after a certain time, requiring integration of rate and concentration.
*   **Add another variable:** Introduce another factor (e.g., LNP surface modification) that affects both phagocytosis and antibody production, requiring the student to combine multiple influences.

**Minor LaTeX/Formatting Improvement:**
*   All existing LaTeX for units is excellent.

---

**Question 5 Critique:**

*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Yes, a very relevant scenario involving LNP clearance by macrophages and quantification of mRNA molecules.
*   **2. Expect numerical answer:** Yes, scientific notation.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Absolutely. This question requires multiple sequential conversions: mass cleared -> number of LNPs cleared -> number of mRNA molecules cleared. This is a strong example of multi-step reasoning with multiple biological quantities.
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** Yes, it's a calculation.
*   **5. Be Unique:** Yes, it's a specific and complex scenario.
*   **6. Single Solution:** Yes.
*   **7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** Yes, clear and professional. The clarification about "completely processed and their mRNA content is degraded" is helpful for scope.
*   **9. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional biology notation:** All units (`$\mu\mathrm{g}$`, `$\mathrm{LNPs}$`, `$\mathrm{mRNA}$ molecules`, `$\mathrm{hours}$`) and notation (`$10^{10}$`) are correctly formatted and consistent.
*   **10. Questions must not be multipart:** Yes, single target quantity.
*   **11. Solution Formatting:** (Applies to solution, not question, but checking inline math).

**Feedback:**
This is an excellent question. It perfectly meets the "Force Multi-Step Reasoning" guideline by requiring a series of logical conversions across different biological scales.

**Minor LaTeX/Formatting Improvement:**
*   All LaTeX formatting for units and numbers is already excellent in this question.

---

**Overall Summary:**

The list of questions is very strong, especially questions 1, 2, 3, and 5. They effectively model biological scenarios, force multi-step reasoning, and include relevant distractors to assess deeper understanding.

The primary area for improvement across the set is to enhance **Question 4** to ensure it truly meets the "Force Multi-Step Reasoning" guideline, as its current form is a single-step calculation.

The LaTeX formatting is generally good, with only minor adjustments suggested for consistency in how numbers are combined with units (e.g., `$7 \, \mathrm{days}$` vs `$7$ days`).
=== Turn 2: Author refines questions ===
Okay, here's the refined list of biology questions based on the provided feedback, with improvements made to Question 4 and minor LaTeX adjustments for consistency across the set:

<question>
A researcher investigates the circulation dynamics of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) loaded with mRNA in mice after intravenous injection. They find that the concentration of intact LNPs in the blood decreases exponentially, with a half-life of $7 \, \mathrm{days}$. After $21 \, \mathrm{days}$, what percentage of the originally injected LNPs remain circulating in the bloodstream?
</question>

<question>
A study examines the relationship between anti-PEG antibody levels and mRNA clearance in vaccinated individuals. Group A has an average anti-PEG antibody titer of $1:1000$, while Group B has a titer of $1:10000$. Despite the tenfold difference in anti-PEG antibodies, both groups exhibit the same mRNA decay rate constant of $k = 0.02 \, \mathrm{h^{-1}}$. Assuming first-order kinetics, calculate the time (in hours) it takes for the mRNA concentration to decrease to $25\%$ of its initial value in both groups.
</question>

<question>
Two groups of vaccinated individuals are compared. Group X shows high levels of blood mRNA at $24$ hours post-vaccination (mean mRNA copies/mL: $5 \times 10^5$), while Group Y exhibits significantly lower levels (mean mRNA copies/mL: $5 \times 10^3$). Despite this difference, both groups develop comparable anti-spike IgG titers of $10^4$ ELISA units/mL and neutralizing antibody titers of $1:500$. If Group X has an anti-spike IgG concentration of $10 \, \mathrm{\mu g/mL}$ (corresponding to their $10^4$ ELISA units/mL titer), and the average molecular weight of IgG is $150 \, \mathrm{kDa}$, estimate the total mass of anti-spike IgG (in $\mathrm{g}$) present in $5 \, \mathrm{L}$ of plasma from Group X.
</question>

<question>
In an in vitro experiment, monocytes are incubated with nanoparticles. At a concentration of $1 \, \mathrm{mg/mL}$ of nanoparticles, the phagocytosis rate by monocytes is initially $80\%$, resulting in an anti-PEG antibody production rate of $0.5 \, \mathrm{ng/mL/h}$.  When the nanoparticle surface is modified to reduce monocyte phagocytosis, the phagocytosis rate drops to $40\%$, and the anti-PEG antibody production rate increases to $1.2 \, \mathrm{ng/mL/h}$. Assuming a constant monocyte population, and starting with an initial anti-PEG antibody concentration of $10 \, \mathrm{ng/mL}$, what will the anti-PEG antibody concentration be (in $\mathrm{ng/mL}$) after $24$ hours when monocyte phagocytosis is at $40\%$?
</question>

<question>
A researcher investigates the clearance of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) by macrophages in the spleen. They find that $60\%$ of injected LNPs are cleared within the first $24$ hours. If the initial injected dose is $50 \, \mu\mathrm{g}$ of LNPs, and there are an average of $10^{10}$ LNPs per $\mu\mathrm{g}$, and the average LNP contains $1000$ mRNA molecules, calculate the number of mRNA molecules cleared by splenic macrophages within the first $24$ hours. Assume all cleared LNPs are completely processed and their mRNA content is degraded. Express your answer in scientific notation.
</question>
Key Changes:

*   **Question 4 Revised:** The revised Question 4 now includes antibody production rates at different phagocytosis levels. The problem now requires calculating the change in concentration over time using the provided rate and initial concentration, thus forcing a multi-step calculation.

*   **LaTeX Consistency:** Minor adjustments to LaTeX formatting were made to ensure numerical values and units are presented consistently (e.g., `$7 \, \mathrm{days}$` now used throughout).
