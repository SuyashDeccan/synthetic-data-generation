Here are some undergraduate-level biology questions based on your specifications:

1.  <question>A physical therapist is assessing a patient's gait post-stroke using Kinovea software. The analysis reveals that the affected arm's average swing amplitude during walking is $15^\circ$, while the unaffected arm's average swing amplitude is $25^\circ$. After a course of Nordic Walking (NW) therapy, the affected arm's swing amplitude increases to $20^\circ$. Assuming that the improvement in arm swing directly correlates with improved motor neuron excitability at a rate of $0.02 \text{ mV/degree}$ and that the resting membrane potential of the motor neurons is $-70 \text{ mV}$, what is the change in the motor neuron membrane potential (in mV) associated with the improvement in arm swing following the NW intervention?</question>

2.  <question>A researcher is evaluating the effectiveness of Nordic Walking (NW) on improving balance in elderly individuals. Baseline Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) scores are recorded. After a 6-week NW program, the average FGA score increases from 20 to 24. Assuming that each point increase on the FGA corresponds to a $0.05 \text{ m/s}$ increase in preferred walking speed and that the initial preferred walking speed was $1.0 \text{ m/s}$, calculate the percentage increase in preferred walking speed following the NW program.</question>

3.  <question>A patient undergoing rehabilitation following a knee replacement performs the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Initially, the TUG test takes 15 seconds. After several weeks of exercise incorporating Nordic Walking (NW), the patient is re-tested. The new TUG time is 12 seconds. If the reduction in TUG time is directly proportional to an increase in stride length, and the patient takes 10 strides during the TUG test, calculate the average decrease in stride length per stride (in meters), assuming a constant walking speed during both TUG tests, and that the total distance covered in TUG test is 7 meters.</question>

4.  <question>During a study on the effects of arm swing on gait, researchers measure the stride frequency of a subject walking at a constant speed. With normal arm swing, the stride frequency is 1.0 Hz. When the subject's arm swing is restricted, the stride frequency increases to 1.2 Hz. Assuming the walking speed remains constant at $1.2 \text{ m/s}$, calculate the change in stride length (in meters) due to restricted arm swing.</question>

5.  <question>A clinical trial is conducted to assess the impact of Nordic Walking (NW) on balance recovery post-stroke. Participants perform the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) before and after the intervention. The average pre-intervention FGA score is 18. Post-intervention, it rises to 22. Assume each point increase on the FGA correlates with a $2 \%$ improvement in trunk control. if initially, the trunk control was $80\%$, calculate the trunk control (in percentage) post-intervention, according to these assumptions.</question>

**Question 1 Critique:**
<question>A physical therapist is assessing a patient's gait post-stroke using Kinovea software. The analysis reveals that the affected arm's average swing amplitude during walking is $15^\circ$, while the unaffected arm's average swing amplitude is $25^\circ$. After a course of Nordic Walking (NW) therapy, the affected arm's swing amplitude increases to $20^\circ$. Assuming that the improvement in arm swing directly correlates with improved motor neuron excitability at a rate of $0.02 \text{ mV/degree}$ and that the resting membrane potential of the motor neurons is $-70 \text{ mV}$, what is the change in the motor neuron membrane potential (in mV) associated with the improvement in arm swing following the NW intervention?</question>

*   **2. Expect answers of single word answer, numerical answer:** Yes, a numerical answer in mV.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes. Step 1: Calculate the change in arm swing. Step 2: Apply the conversion factor to find the change in membrane potential. The resting potential is a well-placed distractor for "change."
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** Yes, asks for a calculation.
*   **5. Be Unique:** Yes, the specific quantitative correlation between arm swing and motor neuron excitability is novel.
*   **6. Single Solution:** Yes, clear and unambiguous.

*   **8. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional biology notation:** Yes, units are consistent (degrees, mV/degree, mV).
*   **9. Questions must not be multipart:** Yes, targets a single quantity.

**Feedback for Question 1:**
*   **Strengths:** This is a strong question. It effectively integrates clinical relevance with a fundamental biological concept and requires careful quantitative reasoning.
*   **Minor Improvement:** None needed. The assumed correlation, while simplified, is clearly stated and serves the purpose of the problem.

**Question 2 Critique:**
<question>A researcher is evaluating the effectiveness of Nordic Walking (NW) on improving balance in elderly individuals. Baseline Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) scores are recorded. After a 6-week NW program, the average FGA score increases from 20 to 24. Assuming that each point increase on the FGA corresponds to a $0.05 \text{ m/s}$ increase in preferred walking speed and that the initial preferred walking speed was $1.0 \text{ m/s}$, calculate the percentage increase in preferred walking speed following the NW program.</question>

*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Good. Models a clinical research scenario (therapy intervention, FGA scores).

*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** Yes, asks for a calculation.
*   **5. Be Unique:** Yes, specific scenario and values are unique.
*   **6. Single Solution:** Yes, clear and unambiguous.
*   **7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** Good. Clear and professional.
*   **8. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional biology notation:** Yes, units are consistent (m/s, percentage).
*   **9. Questions must not be multipart:** Yes, targets a single quantity.

**Feedback for Question 2:**
*   **Strengths:** A well-structured quantitative problem within a relevant biological context. It effectively tests multi-step calculation and interpretation of given correlations.
*   **Minor Improvement:** While the scenario is biological, the core calculation is primarily arithmetic and unit conversion rather than requiring deep biological conceptual understanding. If the goal is to emphasize physiological mechanisms, a different type of quantitative link might be considered (e.g., related to metabolic efficiency or muscle activation). However, as a quantitative biology problem, it's solid.

**Question 3 Critique:**
<question>A patient undergoing rehabilitation following a knee replacement performs the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Initially, the TUG test takes 15 seconds. After several weeks of exercise incorporating Nordic Walking (NW), the patient is re-tested. The new TUG time is 12 seconds. If the reduction in TUG time is directly proportional to an increase in stride length, and the patient takes 10 strides during the TUG test, calculate the average decrease in stride length per stride (in meters), assuming a constant walking speed during both TUG tests, and that the total distance covered in TUG test is 7 meters.</question>

*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Yes, realistic rehabilitation scenario (knee replacement, TUG test).
*   **2. Expect answers of single word answer, numerical answer:** Intended for a numerical answer.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** **Fails.** The problem contains contradictory premises, making a solution impossible or ambiguous.
    *   **Contradiction 1:** "TUG time changes from 15s to 12s" AND "assuming a constant walking speed during both TUG tests" AND "total distance covered... is 7 meters." If distance and speed are constant, time *must* be constant ($D = vT$). A change in time directly contradicts constant speed for a constant distance.
    *   **Contradiction 2:** "If the reduction in TUG time is directly proportional to an *increase* in stride length" AND "calculate the average *decrease* in stride length per stride." The request contradicts the stated relationship and expected outcome.
    *   **Contradiction 3:** If the number of strides (10) and total distance (7m) are constant, then the average stride length ($7m / 10 = 0.7m$) is also constant. This means no increase or decrease in stride length can occur, which contradicts the premise that stride length changes in proportion to TUG time reduction.

*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** Yes, attempts a calculation.
*   **5. Be Unique:** Yes, the specific setup is unique.
*   **6. Single Solution:** **Fails.** No single logical solution due to internal contradictions.
*   **7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** **Fails.** The phrasing leads to logical inconsistencies and a contradictory final request.
*   **8. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional biology notation:** Units are fine, but the underlying calculation is flawed.
*   **9. Questions must not be multipart:** Yes, targets a single quantity, but it's unresolvable.

**Feedback for Question 3:**
*   **Major Flaw:** This question is fundamentally flawed due to contradictory assumptions and a conflicting request. It cannot be solved as stated.
*   **Actionable Improvement:** You must revise this question entirely.
    *   **Option 1 (Simplest):** Remove the "constant walking speed" assumption. If time decreases for a constant distance, speed *must* increase. Then, link this speed increase to stride length (e.g., by keeping stride frequency constant, or relating the change in speed to a change in stride length).
    *   **Option 2 (Example Revision):** "<question>A patient undergoing rehabilitation following a knee replacement performs the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Initially, the TUG test takes 15 seconds. After several weeks of exercise incorporating Nordic Walking (NW), the patient is re-tested. The new TUG time is 12 seconds. If the total distance covered in the TUG test is 7 meters, and the patient's stride frequency remains constant during both tests at 0.5 Hz, calculate the average increase in stride length (in meters) after the NW intervention.</question>" (This provides a solvable path: calculate initial/final speed, then initial/final stride length, then the change).

**Question 4 Critique:**
<question>During a study on the effects of arm swing on gait, researchers measure the stride frequency of a subject walking at a constant speed. With normal arm swing, the stride frequency is 1.0 Hz. When the subject's arm swing is restricted, the stride frequency increases to 1.2 Hz. Assuming the walking speed remains constant at $1.2 \text{ m/s}$, calculate the change in stride length (in meters) due to restricted arm swing.</question>

*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Excellent. Models a scientific study on gait biomechanics (arm swing and stride parameters).
*   **2. Expect answers of single word answer, numerical answer:** Yes, a numerical answer in meters.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes. Step 1: Calculate initial stride length using $v = SL \times SF$. Step 2: Calculate final stride length. Step 3: Calculate the change.
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** Yes, asks for a calculation.
*   **5. Be Unique:** Yes, the specific scenario of arm swing restriction leading to changes in stride parameters while speed is constant is a good, somewhat counter-intuitive setup, making it unique.
*   **6. Single Solution:** Yes, clear and unambiguous.
*   **7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** Excellent. Clear and professional.
*   **8. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional biology notation:** Yes, all units (m/s, Hz, m) are consistent.
*   **9. Questions must not be multipart:** Yes, targets a single quantity.

**Feedback for Question 4:**
*   **Strengths:** This is another excellent question. It effectively combines a relevant biomechanical scenario with a fundamental kinematic equation, forcing multi-step calculation and a clear understanding of the relationships between gait parameters.
*   **Minor Improvement:** None needed.

---

**Question 5 Critique:**
<question>A clinical trial is conducted to assess the impact of Nordic Walking (NW) on balance recovery post-stroke. Participants perform the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) before and after the intervention. The average pre-intervention FGA score is 18. Post-intervention, it rises to 22. Assume each point increase on the FGA correlates with a $2 \%$ improvement in trunk control. if initially, the trunk control was $80\%$, calculate the trunk control (in percentage) post-intervention, according to these assumptions.</question>

*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Good. Models a clinical trial scenario (NW, post-stroke, FGA).
*   **2. Expect answers of single word answer, numerical answer:** Yes, a numerical percentage.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes. Step 1: Calculate FGA score increase. Step 2: Calculate total percentage improvement in trunk control. Step 3: Add to initial trunk control.
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** Yes, asks for a calculation.
*   **5. Be Unique:** Yes, specific scenario and values are unique.
*   **6. Single Solution:** Yes, clear and unambiguous.
*   **7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** Good. Clear and professional.
*   **8. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional biology notation:** Yes, units are consistent (percentage).
*   **9. Questions must not be multipart:** Yes, targets a single quantity.

**Feedback for Question 5:**
*   **Strengths:** Similar to Question 2, this is a well-structured quantitative problem in a relevant biological context. It effectively tests multi-step calculation and interpretation of given correlations.
*   **Minor Improvement:** As with Question 2, the primary challenge is arithmetic and percentage calculation based on given correlations, rather than requiring deep biological conceptual understanding of *why* trunk control improves. It's a valid quantitative biology problem but leans less on physiological mechanisms.

**Overall Summary and Recommendations:**

Your questions generally demonstrate strong adherence to most guidelines, particularly in modeling biology scenarios, forcing multi-step reasoning, avoiding "how" questions, and aiming for uniqueness and single solutions. The use of clinical assessment tools adds excellent realism.

The critical area for improvement is **Question 3**, which contains fatal logical inconsistencies that prevent a correct solution. This question needs to be completely re-written to ensure internal consistency of its premises.

Questions 2 and 5 are solid quantitative problems within a biological context, though they could be made even more biologically rich if they linked the observational measures (FGA, walking speed, trunk control) more directly to underlying physiological changes (e.g., muscle power, neural plasticity, metabolic efficiency) beyond simple assumed correlations. However, for an undergraduate level and given the existing context, they are perfectly acceptable. Questions 1 and 4 are excellent examples of integrating quantitative reasoning with core biological concepts.
