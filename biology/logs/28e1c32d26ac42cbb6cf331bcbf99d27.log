1.  <question>
A researcher is studying a patient exhibiting gait abnormalities, including a reduced arm swing, which is hypothesized to increase their risk of falling. The patient undergoes a Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, completing it in 13.5 seconds. After a 4-week intervention combining Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) and Nordic Walking (NW), the patient's TUG score improves to 11.8 seconds.

A physical therapist is using Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) to improve the gait of a patient. Initially, the patient's stride length is 0.65 m and cadence is 90 steps/min. After the RAS intervention, the cadence increases to 98 steps/min and the speed is maintained. Assuming that speed = stride length * cadence, calculate the new stride length of the patient, in meters, after the RAS intervention.

**Question 1**
<question>
A researcher is studying a patient exhibiting gait abnormalities, including a reduced arm swing, which is hypothesized to increase their risk of falling. The patient undergoes a Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, completing it in 13.5 seconds. After a 4-week intervention combining Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) and Nordic Walking (NW), the patient's TUG score improves to 11.8 seconds. Assuming the TUG score is inversely proportional to mobility and balance, calculate the percentage improvement in the patient's mobility and balance after the intervention.
</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. Real-world clinical scenario with relevant assessment (TUG test) and intervention.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Expect numerical answer):** Yes, a percentage.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Achieved. Requires understanding inverse proportionality, calculating initial and final mobility/balance 'scores' (relative to a constant), and then calculating the percentage change.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Yes, a calculation is requested.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Good. The inverse proportionality aspect makes it less generic than a simple percentage change.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Yes, clear and professional.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units consistent):** Yes, percentage is unitless.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):** Yes.

*   **Actionable Feedback:** This question is very well-constructed and aligns strongly with all guidelines. No significant improvements are needed.

**Question 2**
<question>
A physical therapist is using Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) to improve the gait of a patient. Initially, the patient's stride length is 0.65 m and cadence is 90 steps/min. After the RAS intervention, the cadence increases to 98 steps/min and the speed is maintained. Assuming that speed = stride length * cadence, calculate the new stride length of the patient, in meters, after the RAS intervention.
</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Good. Relevant biological parameters and intervention.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Expect numerical answer):** Yes, in meters.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Achieved. Requires calculating initial speed, then using that constant speed with the new cadence to find the new stride length.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Yes, a calculation is requested.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Less unique. While set in a biological context, the underlying mathematical concept (rearranging a basic formula with one variable held constant) is very common and not particularly "conceptually rich" beyond defining the terms.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units consistent):** Yes, units are consistent (m, steps/min, m/min).
    *   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):** Yes.

*   **Actionable Feedback:** To enhance its uniqueness and conceptual richness, consider adding a layer of complexity. For example, introduce an efficiency component related to optimal stride length or relate speed to energy expenditure, requiring another calculation or conceptual step beyond simple algebraic rearrangement. Alternatively, require a unit conversion (e.g., from steps/min to Hz for cadence) as an integrated step.
