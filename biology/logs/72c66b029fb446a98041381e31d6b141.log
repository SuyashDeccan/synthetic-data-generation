Here are some undergraduate-level biology questions based on the provided specifications:

1.  <question>A researcher is studying the growth of a bacterial population in a chemostat. The chemostat is initially filled with $500\,\mathrm{mL}$ of sterile nutrient broth. The bacterial culture is introduced, and fresh nutrient broth is pumped in at a rate of $50\,\mathrm{mL/hour}$. The spent medium, containing cells, is removed at the same rate. The bacterial strain has a maximum specific growth rate ($\mu_{max}$) of $1.2\,\mathrm{hour^{-1}}$ and a Monod constant ($K_s$) of $0.1\,\mathrm{g/L}$ for the limiting nutrient. If the concentration of the limiting nutrient in the incoming broth is $5\,\mathrm{g/L}$, what is the steady-state bacterial concentration (in $\mathrm{cells/mL}$), assuming a yield coefficient ($Y$) of $0.5 \times 10^{9}\,\mathrm{cells/g}$ of nutrient consumed, given the dilution rate $D=flow\, rate/volume$?</question>

2.  <question>An ecologist is studying a population of snowshoe hares in a boreal forest. The hare population fluctuates cyclically due to interactions with its predator, the lynx. The hare population's per capita growth rate ($r$) is described by the equation $r = r_0 - aP$, where $r_0 = 0.8\,\mathrm{year^{-1}}$ is the intrinsic rate of increase, $a = 0.002\,\mathrm{year^{-1}\,lynx^{-1}}$ is the predation coefficient, and $P$ is the lynx population size. If the carrying capacity ($K$) of the hare population in the absence of lynx is $1000$, and the current lynx population is 200, what is the equilibrium hare population size?</question>

3.  <question>A population of beetles exhibits two color morphs: black (BB or Bb) and brown (bb). A researcher samples 500 beetles and finds 45 brown beetles. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, what is the estimated number of heterozygous beetles (Bb) in the population?</question>

4.  <question>During a study of glucose transport in yeast cells, researchers measure the initial rate of glucose uptake at various external glucose concentrations. They find that at a glucose concentration of $5\,\mathrm{mM}$, the initial uptake rate is $10\,\mathrm{\mu mol/min}$. The Michaelis constant ($K_m$) for glucose transport is $2\,\mathrm{mM}$. Assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics, what is the $V_{max}$ (maximum uptake rate) for glucose transport in these yeast cells, in $\mathrm{\mu mol/min}$?</question>

5.  <question>A plant physiologist is studying transpiration in a sunflower plant. The leaf area of the plant is $0.5\,\mathrm{m^2}$.

The water potential of the soil is $-0.1\,\mathrm{MPa}$, and the water potential of the leaf is $-1.0\,\mathrm{MPa}$. Calculate the leaf resistance to water flow, assuming that soil resistance to water flow is negligible and the sole driving force for transpiration is the water potential difference between the soil and the leaf, expressing the answer in $\mathrm{MPa \cdot day \cdot m^2 / m^3}$?</question>

6.  <question>A microbiologist isolates a new bacterial strain and determines that its genome contains 3 x $10^6$ base pairs.

### Question 1: Chemostat Bacterial Growth

<question>A researcher is studying the growth of a bacterial population in a chemostat. The chemostat is initially filled with $500\,\mathrm{mL}$ of sterile nutrient broth. The bacterial culture is introduced, and fresh nutrient broth is pumped in at a rate of $50\,\mathrm{mL/hour}$. The spent medium, containing cells, is removed at the same rate. The bacterial strain has a maximum specific growth rate ($\mu_{max}$) of $1.2\,\mathrm{hour^{-1}}$ and a Monod constant ($K_s$) of $0.1\,\mathrm{g/L}$ for the limiting nutrient. If the concentration of the limiting nutrient in the incoming broth is $5\,\mathrm{g/L}$, what is the steady-state bacterial concentration (in $\mathrm{cells/mL}$), assuming a yield coefficient ($Y$) of $0.5 \times 10^{9}\,\mathrm{cells/g}$ of nutrient consumed, given the dilution rate $D=flow\, rate/volume$?</question>

**Critique:**
*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Excellent. A realistic chemostat setup.
*   **2. Expect numerical answer:** Excellent. Asks for a specific numerical value.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Excellent. Requires understanding steady-state chemostat principles ($\mu=D$), Monod kinetics to determine steady-state substrate concentration, and using the yield coefficient to calculate cell concentration.
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** Excellent. It's a problem-solving question.
*   **5. Be Unique:** Good. While chemostat problems exist, the specific combination of parameters and the calculation of bacterial concentration (rather than just substrate concentration) makes it a good, non-boilerplate challenge.
*   **6. Single Solution:** Excellent. All necessary parameters are provided for a unique solution.
*   **7. Rigorous, concise phrasing:** Excellent. Clear, professional, and uses conventional notation.
*   **9. Units must be consistent:** Excellent. All units are consistent and appropriate for the context.
*   **10. Questions must not be multipart:** Excellent. Asks for a single target quantity.

**Feedback for Improvement:** No major improvements needed. This is a very strong question that meets all criteria effectively.

### Question 2: Hare-Lynx Population Dynamics

<question>An ecologist is studying a population of snowshoe hares in a boreal forest. The hare population fluctuates cyclically due to interactions with its predator, the lynx. The hare population's per capita growth rate ($r$) is described by the equation $r = r_0 - aP$, where $r_0 = 0.8\,\mathrm{year^{-1}}$ is the intrinsic rate of increase, $a = 0.002\,\mathrm{year^{-1}\,lynx^{-1}}$ is the predation coefficient, and $P$ is the lynx population size. If the carrying capacity ($K$) of the hare population in the absence of lynx is $1000$, and the current lynx population is 200, what is the equilibrium hare population size?</question>

**Critique:**
*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Good. Predator-prey dynamics is a relevant ecological scenario.
*   **2. Expect numerical answer:** Excellent. Asks for a specific numerical value.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Ambiguous. The steps depend on the interpretation of the underlying population model.
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** Excellent. It's a problem-solving question.
*   **5. Be Unique:** Good scenario, but the model formulation is ambiguous.
*   **6. Single Solution:** **Fails.** The phrasing "The hare population's per capita growth rate ($r$) is described by the equation $r = r_0 - aP$" is highly ambiguous when combined with the mention of a carrying capacity ($K$).
    *   **Interpretation A:** If $r$ replaces the intrinsic growth rate in a standard logistic equation (e.g., $dN/dt = (r_0 - aP) N (1 - N/K)$), then the equilibrium (assuming $r_0 - aP > 0$) is simply $N=K$. This would make $r_0, a, P$ irrelevant to the final answer if $r_0 - aP > 0$.
    *   **Interpretation B:** If $r_0$ is the intrinsic growth rate, and $aP$ represents an additional per capita mortality due to predation, typically modeled as $dN/dt = r_0 N (1 - N/K) - aPN$. This leads to an equilibrium $N = K(1 - aP/r_0)$. This interpretation uses all provided values meaningfully but contradicts the explicit definition of $r$ in the question.
    This ambiguity means there isn't a single unambiguous correct answer.
*   **7. Rigorous, concise phrasing:** **Needs improvement.** The definition of $r$ in relation to the logistic growth parameter $K$ is not explicit enough, leading to interpretational issues.
*   **9. Units must be consistent:** Excellent. Units are consistent, and notation is standard.
*   **10. Questions must not be multipart:** Excellent. Asks for a single target quantity.

**Feedback for Improvement:**
To ensure a single solution, the question *must explicitly state the full differential equation* governing the hare population dynamics. For example:
*   Change the sentence to: "The hare population dynamics are described by the equation $dN/dt = r_0 N (1 - N/K) - aPN$." This would clearly lead to $N = K(1 - aP/r_0)$.
*   Alternatively, if Interpretation A was intended, rephrase to make it clear that the effective intrinsic growth rate is reduced, but the carrying capacity remains unchanged: "The hare population follows logistic growth, $dN/dt = r_{eff} N (1 - N/K)$, where the effective intrinsic growth rate $r_{eff} = r_0 - aP$."

### Question 3: Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

<question>A population of beetles exhibits two color morphs: black (BB or Bb) and brown (bb). A researcher samples 500 beetles and finds 45 brown beetles. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, what is the estimated number of heterozygous beetles (Bb) in the population?</question>

**Critique:**
*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Excellent. A standard population genetics scenario.
*   **2. Expect numerical answer:** Excellent. Asks for a specific numerical value.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Excellent. Requires calculating recessive genotype frequency ($q^2$), then allele frequencies ($q, p$), then heterozygous genotype frequency ($2pq$), and finally the number of individuals.
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** Excellent. It's a problem-solving question.
*   **5. Be Unique:** **Fails.** This is a very common and direct application of Hardy-Weinberg principles, found in nearly every introductory genetics or evolution textbook. It does not create a novel scenario.
*   **6. Single Solution:** Excellent. All parameters are provided for a unique solution.
*   **7. Rigorous, concise phrasing:** Excellent. Clear and concise.
*   **9. Units must be consistent:** Excellent. No specific units required beyond counts of individuals.
*   **10. Questions must not be multipart:** Excellent. Asks for a single target quantity.

**Feedback for Improvement:**
To meet the "Be Unique" guideline, revise the scenario to be more complex or novel. For example:
*   Introduce an additional factor (e.g., selection pressure, migration, genetic drift) and ask about the *change* in allele frequencies over generations.
*   Present data from multiple time points or locations and ask for an inference beyond simple equilibrium calculation.
*   Use a more complex genetic system (e.g., sex-linked traits, multiple alleles).

### Question 4: Enzyme Kinetics (Michaelis-Menten)

<question>During a study of glucose transport in yeast cells, researchers measure the initial rate of glucose uptake at various external glucose concentrations. They find that at a glucose concentration of $5\,\mathrm{mM}$, the initial uptake rate is $10\,\mathrm{\mu mol/min}$. The Michaelis constant ($K_m$) for glucose transport is $2\,\mathrm{mM}$. Assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics, what is the $V_{max}$ (maximum uptake rate) for glucose transport in these yeast cells, in $\mathrm{\mu mol/min}$?</question>

**Critique:**
*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Excellent. A realistic enzyme kinetics scenario.
*   **2. Expect numerical answer:** Excellent. Asks for a specific numerical value.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Good. Requires recalling the Michaelis-Menten equation, substituting given values, and solving for the unknown ($V_{max}$).
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** Excellent. It's a problem-solving question.
*   **5. Be Unique:** **Fails.** This is a very common and direct application of the Michaelis-Menten equation, a staple in biochemistry and cell biology textbooks. It does not create a novel scenario.
*   **6. Single Solution:** Excellent. All necessary parameters are provided for a unique solution.
*   **7. Rigorous, concise phrasing:** Excellent. Clear, professional, and uses conventional notation.
*   **9. Units must be consistent:** Excellent. All units are consistent and appropriate.
*   **10. Questions must not be multipart:** Excellent. Asks for a single target quantity.

**Feedback for Improvement:**
Similar to Question 3, this question is too standard. To meet the "Be Unique" guideline, make the problem more complex or integrated. For example:
*   Introduce the concept of inhibitors (competitive, non-competitive) and ask for calculations related to their effects.
*   Provide a set of data points (concentration vs. rate) and ask for graphical determination of $V_{max}$ and $K_m$ (if feasible within the numerical answer constraint, e.g., by providing specific linearized data points).
*   Compare two different enzymes or transporters, or ask about the efficiency of a transport system under specific conditions.

### Question 5: Plant Transpiration

<question>A plant physiologist is studying transpiration in a sunflower plant. The leaf area of the plant is $0.5\,\mathrm{m^2}$. The transpiration rate is measured to be $2 \times 10^{-4}\,\mathrm{m^3\,H_2O/m^2\,leaf\,area/day}$. The water potential of the soil is $-0.1\,\mathrm{MPa}$, and the water potential of the leaf is $-1.0\,\mathrm{MPa}$. Calculate the leaf resistance to water flow, assuming that soil resistance to water flow is negligible and the sole driving force for transpiration is the water potential difference between the soil and the leaf, expressing the answer in $\mathrm{MPa \cdot day \cdot m^2 / m^3}$?</question>

**Critique:**
*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Excellent. A good application of physical principles (Ohm's law analogy) to plant physiology.
*   **2. Expect numerical answer:** Excellent. Asks for a specific numerical value.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Excellent. Requires understanding the relationship between flow, potential difference, and resistance, acknowledging the negligible soil resistance, calculating the potential difference, and performing unit conversions to match the requested output units.
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** Excellent. It's a problem-solving question.
*   **5. Be Unique:** Excellent. This is a conceptually rich and non-standard problem that effectively tests understanding of water movement in plants.
*   **6. Single Solution:** Excellent. All necessary parameters and assumptions are provided for a unique solution.
*   **7. Rigorous, concise phrasing:** Excellent. Clear, professional, and specifies assumptions for clarity.
*   **9. Units must be consistent:** Excellent. All input units are consistent, and the requested output units for resistance are correctly derived from the given flux density.
*   **10. Questions must not be multipart:** Excellent. Asks for a single target quantity.

**Feedback for Improvement:** No improvements needed. This is an excellent question that meets all criteria.

### Question 6: Bacterial DNA Replication Rate

<question>A microbiologist isolates a new bacterial strain and determines that its genome contains 3 x $10^6$ base pairs. After growth in a minimal medium, the average time for the strain to replicate it's entire chromosome is measured to be 30 minutes. Assuming the DNA replication rate is constant throughout the replication cycle, what is the replication rate in base pairs per second?</question>

**Critique:**
*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Good. Basic microbiology concept.
*   **2. Expect numerical answer:** Excellent. Asks for a specific numerical value.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Good. Requires unit conversion (minutes to seconds) and a simple division. However, the biological reasoning is very minimal.
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** Excellent. It's a problem-solving question.
*   **5. Be Unique:** **Fails.** This is a very basic rate calculation and unit conversion problem, lacking significant biological conceptual depth for an undergraduate level. It doesn't incorporate multiple biological principles.
*   **6. Single Solution:** Excellent. All necessary parameters are provided for a unique solution.
*   **7. Rigorous, concise phrasing:** **Needs improvement.** There is a typo: "it's" should be "its".
*   **9. Units must be consistent:** Excellent. Units are clearly defined, and conversion is required.
*   **10. Questions must not be multipart:** Excellent. Asks for a single target quantity.

**Feedback for Improvement:**
The question is too simplistic and serves more as a basic math/unit conversion problem than a challenging biology assessment. To improve and meet the "Be Unique" and "Force Multi-Step Reasoning" guidelines with more biological depth:
*   **Correct the typo:** Change "it's" to "its".
*   **Increase biological complexity:** Instead of just calculating the overall rate, introduce concepts like:
    *   **Bidirectional replication:** If it has a single origin, how many replication forks are there, and what is the speed of each fork?
    *   **Multiple origins (e.g., in eukaryotes/archaea):** Ask about the number of origins or the time required if there were multiple origins.
    *   **Relationship to cell cycle:** Connect replication time to generation time or cell division rate in a population.
    *   **Consider a specific enzyme:** E.g., "If DNA polymerase moves at X bp/s, how many DNA polymerase molecules are needed to complete replication in this time?" (though this might overcomplicate for a single quantity).

A good revision might be: "Assuming bidirectional replication from a single origin, what is the average speed of a single replication fork in base pairs per second?" This would require dividing the genome size by 2 before dividing by time.
