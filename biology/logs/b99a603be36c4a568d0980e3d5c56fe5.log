Here are some novel, undergraduate-level biology questions based on your specifications:

<question>A patient with poorly managed diabetes mellitus is diagnosed with emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) caused by *Escherichia coli*. Imaging reveals extensive gas formation in the right kidney. A quantitative analysis of the gas composition shows a partial pressure of $N_2$ to be $60 \, \mathrm{kPa}$, $CO_2$ to be $25 \, \mathrm{kPa}$, and $H_2$ to be $10 \, \mathrm{kPa}$. Assuming the total pressure inside the kidney is $100 \, \mathrm{kPa}$ and that the gas behaves ideally, calculate the mole fraction of oxygen ($O_2$) in the gas mixture within the infected kidney tissue.</question>

<question>A clinical trial is evaluating a renal-preserving strategy for Class 2 EPN. In a cohort of 120 patients, 80 are managed with minimally invasive percutaneous drainage and antibiotics, while 40 undergo open surgical nephrectomy. After 30 days, 5 patients in the minimally invasive group die, and 10 in the surgical group die. Calculate the absolute risk reduction (ARR) in mortality associated with the minimally invasive management strategy, expressing your answer as a percentage.</question>

<question>Researchers are investigating the diagnostic accuracy of a new imaging technique for EPN. In a study of 200 patients, the technique correctly identifies EPN in 170 cases and correctly rules it out in 20 cases. Calculate the specificity of the imaging technique.</question>

<question>A statistical analysis of EPN cases is conducted to determine the correlation between blood glucose levels and the extent of gas formation in the kidney. A linear regression analysis yields the equation: $G = 0.5B + 10$, where $G$ represents the gas volume (in $\mathrm{cm^3}$) and $B$ represents the blood glucose level (in $\mathrm{mmol/L}$). If a patient's kidney gas volume is $35 \, \mathrm{cm^3}$, what is their estimated blood glucose level?</question>

<question>An experiment is designed to study the growth rate of a gas-forming *E. coli* strain isolated from an EPN patient. The bacteria are cultured in a nutrient-rich broth, and the optical density at 600 nm ($OD_{600}$) is measured every hour. The initial $OD_{600}$ is 0.1, and after 3 hours, it is 0.8. Assuming exponential growth, calculate the specific growth rate ($\mu$) of the *E. coli* strain. Express your answer in $\mathrm{h^{-1}}$.</question>
