Here are some novel undergraduate-level biology questions, formatted as requested:

<question>A patient presents with a mandibular fracture. The surgeon elects for closed reduction followed by maxillomandibular fixation (MMF). Post-operative Day 1, the patient reports a pain score of 6 on a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS). The surgeon anticipates the patient's pain will decrease linearly. After 3 days, the pain score is 3. Assuming a linear decrease in pain, what will the patient's pain score be on Day 5, to the nearest whole number?</question>

<question>A clinical trial is designed to compare two MMF techniques (A and B) for mandibular fracture fixation. The primary outcome is bone union at 6 weeks post-op. 50 patients are randomized to each group. In group A, 45 patients show bone union. In group B, 40 patients show bone union. Calculate the absolute risk reduction (ARR) of MMF technique A compared to technique B, expressing your answer as a percentage.</question>

<question>A surgeon is evaluating the suitability of MMF for a patient with a complex mandibular fracture. The patient has pre-existing temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD). Research indicates that 15% of patients with TMD experience exacerbation of symptoms with MMF. If the surgeon estimates the patient's pre-MMF TMD pain score to be 4 on a scale of 1-10, and assumes a 50% increase in that score if exacerbation occurs, what is the predicted TMD pain score post-MMF (round to one decimal place)?</question>

<question>An experiment is conducted to evaluate inflammatory response after MMF using a specific type of arch bar. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are measured in $\mathrm{mg/L}$ at baseline and 72 hours post-op. The mean baseline CRP is $5\,\mathrm{mg/L}$. After 72 hours, the mean CRP level is $25\,\mathrm{mg/L}$. Calculate the percentage increase in CRP levels.</question>

<question>Two MMF techniques are compared for their impact on patient comfort using a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 10. Technique A shows an average VAS score of 3.5, while Technique B shows an average VAS score of 5.0. If the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for VAS is 1.0, is the difference in VAS scores between the two techniques clinically significant? Answer 1 if significant or 0 if not significant.</question>
