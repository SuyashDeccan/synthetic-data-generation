<question>
A retrospective study analyzes 500 patients diagnosed with Emphysematous Pyelonephritis (EPN). The study reveals that 60% of patients have Class 2 EPN. Among Class 2 EPN patients, 75% are managed with minimally invasive techniques, and the remaining 25% undergo open surgical nephrectomy. If the mortality rate for minimally invasive management is 5% and for open surgical nephrectomy is 20%, calculate the total number of deaths attributable to Class 2 EPN in this cohort. Round the answer to the nearest integer.
</question>

<question>
A research team is investigating gas production rates in *Escherichia coli* strains isolated from EPN patients. They culture two strains, EPN-A and EPN-B, under anaerobic conditions in a glucose-rich medium. After 24 hours, EPN-A produces $2.5 \times 10^{-5}$ moles of CO$_2$ per cell, while EPN-B produces $1.8 \times 10^{-5}$ moles of CO$_2$ per cell. If the initial cell density for both cultures was $1 \times 10^6$ cells/mL and the final volume of each culture is 100 mL, calculate the difference in the total moles of CO$_2$ produced between the two strains (EPN-A minus EPN-B) after 24 hours.
</question>

<question>
A clinical study on EPN patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and other comorbidities uses a logistic regression model to predict mortality risk. The model includes DM (0=no, 1=yes) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (0=no, 1=yes) as predictor variables. The logistic regression equation is: $$ \text{log(odds)} = -3.0 + 1.5(\text{DM}) + 0.8(\text{CVD}) $$ A patient has both DM and CVD. Calculate the predicted probability of mortality for this patient, rounded to two decimal places.
</question>

<question>
An observational study examines the correlation between the size of gas pockets in the kidney (measured in cm$^3$) and the severity of EPN. The study uses Pearson correlation coefficient (r) as the correlation measurement. The sample size of 100, and a pearsons correlation coefficent of 0.50 with a standard deviation of 0.3. Calculate the t-statistic for testing the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between gas pocket size and EPN severity. Round to two decimal places.
</question>
**Critique:**
*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Met. A realistic observational study in a biological context.
*   **2. Expect answers of single word answer, numerical answer:** Met. Expects a numerical answer (t-statistic).
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Met, *if* the student knows the specific formula for the t-statistic in this context.
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** Met. Asks for a calculation.
*   **5. Be Unique:** Met. Specific and novel scenario.
*   **6. Single Solution:** **Failed.** The inclusion of "a standard deviation of 0.3" is extraneous and confusing information. The standard formula for the t-statistic to test the significance of Pearson's r is $t = r \sqrt{\frac{n-2}{1-r^2}}$. This formula *does not* use a standard deviation of r directly as input, especially not in this form. Its presence can mislead students into attempting to incorporate it, leading to an incorrect or non-standard solution, or causing undue confusion.
*   **7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** **Failed.** The phrase "with a standard deviation of 0.3" is not rigorous because it's unclear what specific standard deviation it refers to (e.g., standard deviation of the raw data, standard error of r?), and it's not concise because it's irrelevant for the standard calculation of the t-statistic for Pearson's r. This adds ambiguity and complexity without purpose.
*   **9. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional biology notation:** Met. The t-statistic is unitless.
*   **10. Questions must not be multipart:** Met. Asks for a single quantity.

**Overall Feedback:** This question needs improvement. **Actionable Feedback:** Remove "with a standard deviation of 0.3" as it is extraneous information and makes the question misleading, violating the guidelines for single solution and rigorous/concise phrasing.

=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of each question based on your guidelines:

---

**Question 1: Total Deaths from Class 2 EPN**

*   **Critique:** This is a strong quantitative question.
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. Models a realistic clinical retrospective study scenario.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Expect numerical answer):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, it requires multiple sequential calculations (patients in class, patients by management type, deaths in each type, then summing). The "biological principles" are epidemiological calculations crucial in clinical biology.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Yes, it's a calculation.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Yes, specific numbers and context make it unique.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Yes, clear and professional.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Units consistent):** "Number of deaths" is a count, so no SI units are explicitly required beyond the numerical value.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Not multipart):** Yes, asks for a single quantity.
*   **Improvement Suggestion:** None. This question is well-designed.

---

**Question 2: Difference in CO$_2$ Production**

*   **Critique:** A good scenario, but with a critical biological ambiguity.
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Good. A plausible microbiology research scenario.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Expect numerical answer):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** It intends to, but the premise is flawed/ambiguous. The phrase "$X$ moles of CO$_2$ per cell" for a 24-hour bacterial culture, coupled with only "initial cell density," is problematic. Bacteria grow exponentially, so the total number of cells producing CO$_2$ over 24 hours is far greater than the initial density. This means the total CO$_2$ production cannot simply be (moles/cell) * (initial cell density) * (volume). If it means "cumulative moles produced per *initial* cell over 24 hours," it needs to be explicitly stated to maintain biological accuracy and avoid ambiguity.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Ambiguous due to the biological flaw regarding cell growth/density. If interpreted as "moles per initial cell accumulated over 24 hours," then yes. If "per cell" means per instantaneous cell count, the question is unsolvable with the given information.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** The phrasing of "per cell" without specifying if it's per initial cell, average cell, or final cell over a growth period creates an issue.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Units consistent):** Yes, units are consistent and lead to moles.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Not multipart):** Yes.
*   **Improvement Suggestion:** Clarify the meaning of "moles of CO$_2$ per cell" in the context of a 24-hour bacterial culture. For example: "After 24 hours, EPN-A accumulated a total of $2.5 \times 10^{-5}$ moles of CO$_2$ for every *initial* cell in the culture." Alternatively, provide final cell densities or a growth rate.

**Question 3: Predicted Probability of Mortality**

*   **Critique:** An excellent question.
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. A realistic clinical study using a common biostatistical model (logistic regression).
    *   **Guideline 2 (Expect numerical answer):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, requires substitution, exponentiation (odds calculation), and then converting odds to probability. This assesses understanding of a key biostatistical principle.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Yes, clear and professional.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Units consistent):** Probability is unitless; notation is standard for logistic regression.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Not multipart):** Yes.
*   **Improvement Suggestion:** None. This question is perfectly aligned with the guidelines.

---

**Question 4: Absolute Difference in Cured Patients**

*   **Critique:** A solid, straightforward quantitative question.
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. A realistic clinical trial scenario.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Expect numerical answer):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, calculates cured patients for each strategy and then finds the difference. The "biological principles" here are basic arithmetic and percentage interpretation within a clinical context.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Yes, clear and concise.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Units consistent):** "Number of cured patients" is a count, no SI units needed.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Not multipart):** Yes.
*   **Improvement Suggestion:** None. This question is well-designed.

---

**Question 5: T-statistic for Correlation**

*   **Critique:** Another excellent question.
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. A plausible observational study investigating a biological correlation.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Expect numerical answer):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, requires recall/application of the formula for the t-statistic in correlation testing, and then substitution and calculation. This assesses a specific biostatistical principle.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Yes, clear and precise.
    *   **Guideline 8 (Units consistent):** cm$^3$ is an appropriate unit for volume. t-statistic is unitless. Symbols are standard.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Not multipart):** Yes.
*   **Improvement Suggestion:** None. This question is well-designed.

**Overall Summary:**

The questions are generally of very high quality, consistently meeting most of your guidelines. They excel at modeling biological scenarios, forcing multi-step quantitative reasoning, and avoiding simple definitions. The strongest questions (1, 3, 4, 5) leverage quantitative skills within realistic biological contexts. The only area for improvement is the biological ambiguity in **Question 2**, which needs clarification to ensure a single, biologically accurate solution.
