Here are some novel, undergraduate-level biology questions based on the provided topics, key concepts, and guidelines:

<question>
A rural hospital, reliant on a local pond for its water supply, experiences a severe earthquake. The quake breaches a nearby industrial waste lagoon, releasing heavy metals into the pond. Prior to the earthquake, the pond's phytoplankton population exhibited a stable growth rate, with a carrying capacity, $K = 5.0 \times 10^6$ cells/mL. Following the contamination, the phytoplankton's intrinsic rate of increase, $r$, is halved, while the carrying capacity decreases to $K = 2.0 \times 10^6$ cells/mL due to the toxic effects of the pollutants. If the initial phytoplankton population density, $N_0$, immediately after the earthquake is $1.0 \times 10^6$ cells/mL, calculate the phytoplankton population density (cells/mL) predicted by the logistic growth model one week (7 days) later, assuming continuous growth. Assume that the original intrinsic rate of increase was $r = 0.5$ day$^{-1}$. Report your answer to one decimal place.
</question>

<question>
A hospital emergency department (ED) is treating victims of a wildfire. A key resource is the availability of properly sized oxygen masks. Initially, the ED has 120 adult masks, 80 child masks, and a predicted need (based on initial patient triage) for 180 adult masks and 110 child masks over the next 24 hours. A neighboring hospital offers to transfer masks. However, due to logistical constraints from road closures, there is a fixed delay of 6 hours before any transferred masks can arrive at the ED. The ED's oxygen consumption rate per adult patient is $15\,\mathrm{L/min}$ and per child patient is $8\,\mathrm{L/min}$. If the ED anticipates treating an average of 6 adult patients and 4 child patients per hour who need oxygen masks, calculate the total liters of oxygen that could be administered using adult masks during the critical 6-hour period before the transfer is realized.
</question>

<question>
During a hospital evacuation due to a flood, the medical staff must prioritize patients based on their need for ventilator support. There are 15 patients on ventilators. The ventilators have a battery life of 4 hours. An ambulance can transport a maximum of 3 patients at a time to a nearby hospital. It takes 30 minutes for a round trip. If the evacuation starts at time $t=0$ and no additional ventilators are available, how many patients can be transported to the new hospital before the ventilator batteries of all 15 patients run out?
</question>

<question>
A hospital's water purification system fails due to a terrorist attack on the municipal water supply. An alternative source of sterile water is needed for preparing intravenous (IV) solutions. The hospital has a stock of anhydrous dextrose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$, molar mass = $180\,\mathrm{g/mol}$). A 5% (w/v) dextrose solution is required, meaning 5 grams of dextrose per 100 mL of solution. The hospital needs to prepare 500 IV bags, each containing 250 mL of the 5% dextrose solution. Calculate the total mass (in kg) of anhydrous dextrose required to prepare all 500 IV bags.
</question>

<question>
A hospital's power grid is compromised by a cyberattack. A backup generator can supply power, but its fuel supply is limited. The hospital must maintain a minimum ATP production rate of $500\,\mathrm{mol/hour}$ to keep critical systems functioning. Assume that the primary ATP-consuming processes rely on cellular respiration, with a P/O ratio (ATP molecules produced per oxygen atom consumed) of 2.5. If the generator consumes 10 liters of fuel per $10^6$ moles of $O_2$ consumed. How many liters of fuel will be needed in order to keep critical systems functioning for 24 hours?

</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Overall Assessment:** Excellent. This is a very well-designed question that effectively integrates a biological model into a compelling real-world scenario.
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Achieved. The scenario of an environmental disaster impacting a hospital's water supply and affecting a phytoplankton population is realistic and requires understanding of population dynamics.
*   **Guideline 2 (Single/Numerical Answer):** Achieved. The question asks for a specific numerical value (population density).
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Achieved. Requires identifying the correct model (logistic growth), applying new parameters ($r$ and $K$ changes), and performing the calculation for $N(t)$ over a specified time.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How-based questions):** Achieved. It's a problem-solving question, not a definition.

</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Overall Assessment:** Weak. While framed in a hospital setting, the problem primarily tests arithmetic and logistics rather than core biological principles.
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Weak. The scenario is set in a hospital, but the problem does not require biological reasoning or conceptual understanding. "Oxygen consumption rate" is a numerical input, not a biological concept to be explored or applied.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Partially achieved. It involves multiple arithmetic steps, but these are logistical calculations, not biological principles.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Partially achieved. The scenario is somewhat unique, but the problem type (resource calculation) is generic.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units, Notation):** The information about child masks, the 24-hour predicted need, and the mask transfer are all distractors that are not used in the calculation for the specific question asked. While distractors can be used, here they contribute to obscuring the lack of biological depth.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
*   **Integrate Biological Principles:** Refocus the question to require a deeper biological understanding. Instead of simply calculating total oxygen delivered, consider:
    *   How different oxygen flow rates impact *patient physiology* (e.g., blood oxygen saturation, partial pressures of gases), requiring knowledge of gas exchange or respiratory physiology.
    *   The *efficiency* of oxygen utilization by patients given different mask types or conditions.
    *   Linking oxygen delivery to cellular respiration and ATP production in the context of patient recovery or metabolic needs.
*   **Remove Irrelevant Information:** Streamline the scenario to include only information pertinent to the calculation, or integrate all information into a more complex, biologically-driven question.

The ventilators have a battery life of 4 hours. An ambulance can transport a maximum of 3 patients at a time to a nearby hospital. It takes 30 minutes for a round trip. If the evacuation starts at time $t=0$ and no additional ventilators are available, how many patients can be transported to the new hospital before the ventilator batteries of all 15 patients run out?
</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Overall Assessment:** Weak. Similar to Question 2, this is a logistics/scheduling problem disguised as a biology question.
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Weak. The scenario involves patients and ventilators, but no biological principles are tested. The question is purely about calculating ambulance trips within a time limit.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Partially achieved. It involves multiple arithmetic steps (time conversion, trips calculation, patient count), but these are logistical, not biological.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Partially achieved. The specific scenario is somewhat unique, but the problem type (resource/time management) is common.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** The phrase "prioritize patients based on their need for ventilator support" sets up an expectation of a prioritization problem, but the calculation simply determines if *all* patients can be moved, rendering the prioritization aspect irrelevant to the question's answer.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
*   **Integrate Biological Principles:** To make this a biology question, connect the "ventilator support" to deeper biological concepts. For example:
    *   How does the *metabolic rate* of a ventilated patient influence the energy consumption of the ventilator, thereby affecting its battery life?
    *   What are the *physiological consequences* for patients if they lose ventilator support after a certain duration, requiring knowledge of respiratory physiology or critical care?
    *   Consider different patient "needs" based on biological criteria (e.g., stability, risk of decompensation) that would truly require "prioritization" in the calculation.

A hospital's water purification system fails due to a terrorist attack on the municipal water supply. An alternative source of sterile water is needed for preparing intravenous (IV) solutions. The hospital has a stock of anhydrous dextrose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$, molar mass = $180\,\mathrm{g/mol}$). A 5% (w/v) dextrose solution is required, meaning 5 grams of dextrose per 100 mL of solution. The hospital needs to prepare 500 IV bags, each containing 250 mL of the 5% dextrose solution. Calculate the total mass (in kg) of anhydrous dextrose required to prepare all 500 IV bags.
</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Overall Assessment:** Weak. This is a basic chemistry calculation (concentration, solution preparation) in a hospital setting.
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Weak. While IV solutions are used in biology and medicine, the problem only requires basic stoichiometry/concentration calculations. No biological reasoning or understanding of dextrose's physiological role (e.g., osmolarity, metabolic energy) is required. The molar mass provided ($180\,\mathrm{g/mol}$) is a distractor as it's not needed for a weight/volume percentage calculation.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Partially achieved. It involves multiple arithmetic steps (total volume, mass calculation, unit conversion), but these are fundamental chemistry/mathematics, not biological principles.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** The scenario is specific, but the underlying calculation is very standard for chemistry.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
*   **Integrate Biological Principles:** Transform this into a biology question by requiring the student to apply knowledge of biological chemistry or physiology:
    *   **Osmolarity:** Ask about the *osmolarity* of the 5% dextrose solution and its implications for patient safety (e.g., potential for red blood cell lysis or crenation), requiring calculation of moles and consideration of isotonicity. This would utilize the molar mass.
    *   **Bioenergetics:** Ask about the *total energy* (e.g., calories/joules) provided by the dextrose in the 500 IV bags, linking it to patient nutritional needs or metabolism.
    *   **Transport/Absorption:** Discuss how the dextrose is transported or utilized at the cellular level.

<question>
A hospital's power grid is compromised by a cyberattack. A backup generator can supply power, but its fuel supply is limited. The hospital must maintain a minimum ATP production rate of $500\,\mathrm{mol/hour}$ to keep critical systems functioning. Assume that the primary ATP-consuming processes rely on cellular respiration, with a P/O ratio (ATP molecules produced per oxygen atom consumed) of 2.5. If the generator consumes 10 liters of fuel per $10^6$ moles of $O_2$ consumed. How many liters of fuel will be needed in order to keep critical systems functioning for 24 hours?
</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Overall Assessment:** Problematic. While attempting to connect bioenergetics to a real-world scenario, the core premise for calculating fuel consumption is biologically and physically unsound.
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Problematic. The connection between "generator consumes fuel per $10^6$ moles of $O_2$ consumed" is nonsensical. A generator consumes fuel to produce *electrical energy*, which then powers hospital systems. These systems, if involving biological processes, consume $O_2$ for ATP. There is no direct, proportional relationship between the generator's fuel consumption and the *biological* $O_2$ consumed by the hospital's *systems* in this manner. This fundamentally breaks the physical reasoning of the scenario.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** Partially achieved, but one of the critical links is flawed.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Fails. The phrasing "P/O ratio (ATP molecules produced per oxygen atom consumed) of 2.5" is ambiguous. While common P/O ratios are per $O_2$ molecule, specifying "per oxygen atom" leads to a factor of 2 difference ($2.5 \text{ ATP/O atom} \implies 5 \text{ ATP/}O_2 \text{ molecule}$). This ambiguity, coupled with the flawed generator premise, makes a single correct solution difficult to ascertain meaningfully.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** Fails. The phrasing of the generator's fuel consumption relationship is not rigorous and introduces a non-physical concept.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
*   **Revise the Generator-Fuel-Oxygen Link:** This is the most critical issue. Instead of linking generator fuel directly to biological oxygen consumption, relate it to electrical power.
    *   **Option 1 (Energy Conversion):** State the total *electrical power* required by critical systems. Then, state the generator's *fuel efficiency* (e.g., liters of fuel per kWh generated). The biological link could then be: "The energy required to sustain critical systems' ATP production is equivalent to X amount of power (e.g., Joules or kWh)." This would then be an energy conversion problem.
    *   **Option 2 (Oxygen Supply):** Frame the problem around the power needed to operate oxygen concentrators or medical devices that *supply* oxygen. For example: "The generator powers oxygen concentrators that produce X moles of $O_2$ per hour for critical systems. The generator consumes Y liters of fuel per hour of operation."
*   **Clarify P/O Ratio:** Explicitly state if the P/O ratio is per mole of $O_2$ molecules or per mole of oxygen atoms, to avoid ambiguity. The standard P/O ratio (e.g., 2.5) is usually given per $O_2$ molecule consumed.

<question>
A hospital emergency department (ED) is treating victims of a wildfire, many suffering from smoke inhalation. The ED anticipates treating an average of 6 adult patients and 4 child patients per hour who require supplemental oxygen. Adult patients require a target blood oxygen saturation ($SpO_2$) of 95%, achievable with an oxygen flow rate that consumes $15\,\mathrm{L/min}$ of oxygen. Child patients require a target $SpO_2$ of 92%, achievable with an oxygen flow rate of $8\,\mathrm{L/min}$. The hospital's central oxygen supply has a reserve of 50,000 L.  However, due to a power outage affecting ventilation systems, the ED must also dedicate 5% of the oxygen supply *per hour* to maintain proper air circulation in the treatment area (calculated from the initial 50,000 L reserve). Calculate the maximum number of *full* hours the hospital can maintain the target blood oxygen saturation levels for the anticipated patients before the oxygen reserve is depleted.

During a hospital evacuation due to a flood, medical staff must prioritize patients based on their dependency on ventilators and their overall physiological stability. There are 15 patients on ventilators, each with a battery life of 4 hours. An ambulance can transport a maximum of 3 patients at a time to a nearby hospital. It takes 30 minutes for a round trip. Critically, patients are categorized as "stable" (able to tolerate brief interruptions in ventilation without significant desaturation) or "unstable" (high risk of desaturation and complications with even short interruptions). "Unstable" patients consume 20% more ventilator battery power than "stable" patients. If 6 patients are classified as "unstable" and 9 are classified as "stable," how many patients can be transported to the new hospital *before any patient's* ventilator battery is fully depleted, assuming patients are selected for transport irrespective of their stability?

Calculate the maximum number of *full* hours the hospital can maintain the target blood oxygen saturation levels for the anticipated patients before the oxygen reserve is depleted.
</question>

**Critique:**

*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Excellent. A highly relevant and complex medical/logistical scenario.
*   **2. Expect numerical answers:** Yes, a single numerical answer for full hours.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes. Calculate oxygen consumption for adults, children, and total patient consumption per hour. Calculate constant oxygen consumption for ventilation. Sum these rates and divide the total reserve by the total consumption rate. Requires careful unit conversion (minutes to hours).
*   **4. Avoid How-based questions:** Yes, it's a calculation problem.
*   **5. Be Unique:** The dual drain on oxygen (patients + ventilation) adds a unique and realistic layer of complexity.
*   **6. Single Solution:** Yes, the phrasing "calculated from the initial 50,000 L reserve" clarifies that the ventilation oxygen drain is a constant $0.05 \times 50,000\,\mathrm{L} = 2500\,\mathrm{L/hour}$. This prevents ambiguity.

During a hospital evacuation due to a flood, medical staff must prioritize patients based on their dependency on ventilators and their overall physiological stability. There are 15 patients on ventilators, each with a battery life of 4 hours. An ambulance can transport a maximum of 3 patients at a time to a nearby hospital. It takes 30 minutes for a round trip. Critically, patients are categorized as "stable" (able to tolerate brief interruptions in ventilation without significant desaturation) or "unstable" (high risk of desaturation and complications with even short interruptions). "Unstable" patients consume 20% more ventilator battery power than "stable" patients. If 6 patients are classified as "unstable" and 9 are classified as "stable," how many patients can be transported to the new hospital *before any patient's* ventilator battery is fully depleted, assuming patients are selected for transport irrespective of their stability?
</question>

**Critique:**

*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Excellent. A compelling and realistic medical emergency scenario with logistical challenges.
*   **2. Expect numerical answers:** Yes, a single numerical answer for the number of patients.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes. Calculate effective battery life for stable and unstable patients. Determine the overall time limit based on the most limiting factor (unstable patients). Calculate the number of round trips possible within that time limit. Calculate total patients transported.
*   **4. Avoid How-based questions:** Yes, it's a calculation problem.
*   **5. Be Unique:** The combination of battery life, differential consumption, and transport logistics is very unique and well-designed.
*   **6. Single Solution:** **Area for Improvement.** The phrasing "assuming patients are selected for transport irrespective of their stability" combined with "before *any* patient's ventilator battery is fully depleted" introduces a slight ambiguity.
    *   **Intended interpretation (most likely):** The earliest any battery would deplete (i.e., an unstable patient's battery) dictates the total time available for *all* transport. This makes the unstable patients' battery life ($4 \text{ hours} / 1.2 = 3.33 \text{ hours}$) the hard limit for the operation. This leads to a single solution.
    *   **Potential misinterpretation:** Some might interpret "irrespective of stability" to mean some average, or that you could just keep transporting stable patients longer. However, "before *any* patient's" generally forces the most critical constraint to be the limiting factor.

*   **7. Rigorous, concise phrasing:** Mostly good, but the ambiguity described above could be tightened.
    *   **Suggested improvement:** "Considering the most vulnerable patients, what is the maximum number of patients that can be transported before the ventilator battery of *any* patient (including those awaiting transport) is fully depleted?" This removes the "irrespective of their stability" clause which, while meant to simplify, introduces confusion.

*   **8. Units must be consistent:** Hours and minutes are consistent, requiring conversion.
*   **9. Not multipart:** Yes, focuses on a single target quantity.
*   **10. Solution Formatting:** No LaTeX required in the question, but variables are clear.

**Overall Feedback:** A very strong, challenging problem with excellent real-world relevance. The ambiguity in wording for the limiting factor is the only significant point of improvement.

<question>
A hospital's water purification system fails due to a terrorist attack on the municipal water supply. An alternative source of sterile water is needed for preparing intravenous (IV) solutions containing dextrose. The hospital has a stock of anhydrous dextrose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$, molar mass = $180\,\mathrm{g/mol}$). A 5% (w/v) dextrose solution is required, meaning 5 grams of dextrose per 100 mL of solution. The hospital needs to prepare 500 IV bags, each containing 250 mL of the 5% dextrose solution. Calculate the osmolarity (in mOsm/L) of the 5% dextrose solution. Report your answer to the nearest whole number. Assume that dextrose does not dissociate in water.
</question>

**Critique:**

*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** Excellent. A highly practical and critical medical scenario.
*   **2. Expect numerical answers:** Yes, a single numerical answer for osmolarity.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes. Convert % (w/v) to g/L, then to mol/L using molar mass, then to Osmol/L (since it doesn't dissociate), and finally to mOsm/L. This is a clear multi-step calculation.
*   **4. Avoid How-based questions:** Yes, it's a calculation problem.
*   **5. Be Unique:** While osmolarity calculation is standard, the context (terrorist attack, IV bags, specific amounts) makes it a unique application.
*   **6. Single Solution:** Yes, unambiguous calculation.
*   **7. Rigorous, concise phrasing:** Very clear and professional. The definition of % (w/v) is helpful.
*   **8. Units must be consistent:** All units are consistent and clearly specified, requiring careful conversion.
*   **9. Not multipart:** Yes, focuses on a single target quantity (osmolarity).
*   **10. Solution Formatting:** LaTeX is correctly used for chemical formula, molar mass, and units.

**Overall Feedback:** This is an excellent question. It effectively applies fundamental chemistry principles (stoichiometry, solution concentration) to a vital biological/medical application. The information about the number of IV bags and their volume serves as a common distractor, which is a valid testing technique.

A hospital's power grid is compromised by a cyberattack. A backup generator supplies power to critical systems, including oxygen concentrators. The hospital must maintain a minimum ATP production rate of $500\,\mathrm{mol/hour}$ across all critical systems to ensure patient survival. Cellular respiration, which provides the ATP, has a P/O ratio (ATP molecules produced per $O_2$ molecule consumed) of 2.5. The oxygen concentrators, powered by the generator, produce oxygen at a rate of 0.005 moles of $O_2$ per kWh (kilowatt-hour) of electrical energy consumed. The generator has a fuel efficiency of 3 liters of fuel per kWh of electrical energy produced.

*   **2. Expect numerical answers:** Yes, a single numerical answer for fuel consumption rate.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** Yes. A complex chain of calculations: ATP rate -> $O_2$ consumption rate (using P/O ratio) -> electrical energy (kWh) required for concentrators -> fuel consumption rate (using generator efficiency). This is highly multi-step and requires linking different domains.
*   **4. Avoid How-based questions:** Yes, it's a calculation problem.
*   **5. Be Unique:** Extremely unique and novel. It creatively integrates biology, physics/engineering, and resource management.
*   **6. Single Solution:** Yes, unambiguous calculation given the parameters.
*   **7. Rigorous, concise phrasing:** Very clear and professional.
*   **8. Units must be consistent:** All units are consistent, and the problem requires meticulous unit tracking and conversion across different domains (moles, kWh, liters, hours).
*   **9. Not multipart:** Yes, focuses on a single target quantity.
*   **10. Solution Formatting:** LaTeX is correctly used for variables and units.

**Overall Feedback:** This is an exceptionally strong and impressive question. It's truly interdisciplinary, requiring a deep understanding of biological processes (cellular respiration, P/O ratio) combined with quantitative reasoning skills in energy and resource management. This is a pinnacle example of a challenging and well-designed biology assessment problem.

<question>
A rural hospital, dependent on a local spring for its water supply, faces a cryptosporidium outbreak following heavy rainfall and agricultural runoff. Before the contamination, the spring supported a stable population of Daphnia magna, a filter-feeding crustacean, with a carrying capacity, $K = 8.0 \times 10^4$ individuals/L. After the outbreak, the spring's ability to support Daphnia is reduced due to increased turbidity and decreased food quality, resulting in a lower carrying capacity of $K = 3.0 \times 10^4$ individuals/L.  The cryptosporidium also directly affects the Daphnia, reducing their per capita birth rate.  If the Daphnia population's intrinsic rate of increase, $r$, was initially $0.8$ day$^{-1}$, and this is now reduced to $0.3$ day$^{-1}$ due to the parasite, and the initial Daphnia population density, $N_0$, immediately after the rainfall is $2.0 \times 10^4$ individuals/L, calculate the Daphnia population density (individuals/L) predicted by the logistic growth model three days later, assuming continuous growth. Report your answer to the nearest whole number.

A hospital is treating patients exposed to a novel nerve agent. The primary treatment involves administering atropine, a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine receptors. The effective dose of atropine required to achieve 50% receptor occupancy is 2 mg (represented as the $EC_{50}$). A patient presents with severe symptoms requiring 80% receptor occupancy for therapeutic effect. Assuming a standard competitive binding model, calculate the atropine dose (in mg) needed to achieve the required 80% receptor occupancy. Report your answer to one decimal place.

During a mass casualty event, a hospital must prioritize patients needing blood transfusions. The hospital has 10 units of Type O negative (O-) blood available. Based on current patient data, the predicted blood usage rate is as follows: 3 units will be used per hour due to immediate trauma cases and an additional usage rate of 0.5 unit will be used per hour for patients with ongoing internal bleeding. If the event is predicted to last for 6 hours, and after 6 hours additional O- blood arrives at the hospital, will the hospital run out of O- blood before additional blood is available? Respond either yes or no.

A hospital needs to prepare a buffer solution for maintaining the pH of cell cultures. They require 1.5 L of a 0.2 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.2. They have access to stock solutions of 1 M $KH_2PO_4$ (monobasic) and 1 M $K_2HPO_4$ (dibasic). The $pK_a$ of the relevant phosphate equilibrium is 7.2. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, calculate the volume (in mL) of the 1 M $K_2HPO_4$ solution needed to prepare the required buffer. Report your answer to the nearest whole number.

<question>
A hospital's HVAC system is compromised during a heatwave, affecting the temperature regulation of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Premature infants in the NICU have a surface area to mass ratio of approximately $0.06 \ m^2/g$ and a metabolic rate of $200 \ J/kg/day$. The average mass of an infant in the NICU is 1 kg. If the room temperature increases by 5°C, increasing the rate of heat loss to the environment through radiation by $12 \ W/m^2$ (watts per square meter) due to increased radiation, will the infant’s metabolic rate be sufficient to counter heat loss if the excess radiative heatloss is the only consideration? Respond either yes or no.
