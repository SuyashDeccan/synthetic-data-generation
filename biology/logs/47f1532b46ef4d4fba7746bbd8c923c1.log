Here are some novel, undergraduate-level biology questions based on the given topics, key concepts, and guidelines:

1.  <question>A clinical trial is assessing the effectiveness of a new counseling strategy combined with reminders to improve medication adherence in asthma patients. At the start of the trial, the average score on the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 (MMAS-8) was 3.0. After 3 months of the intervention, the average MMAS-8 score increased to 6.5. A parallel group received only standard care, and their MMAS-8 score remained unchanged at 3.0. Assuming a maximum possible MMAS-8 score of 8.0, calculate the percentage increase in adherence for the intervention group relative to the maximum achievable improvement.</question>
    $$\begin{aligned}
        \text{Adherence Increase} &= \text{Final score} - \text{Initial Score} \\
        &= 6.5 - 3.0 \\
        &= 3.5
    \end{aligned}$$
    $$\begin{aligned}
    \text{Max possible increase} &= 8.0 - 3.0 \\
                                     &= 5.0
    \end{aligned}$$

    $$\begin{aligned}
    \text{Percentage Increase} &= \frac{\text{Adherence Increase}}{\text{Max possible increase}} \times 100 \\
                                   &= \frac{3.5}{5.0} \times 100 \\
                                   &= 70
    \end{aligned}$$
    </question>

2.  <question>In a study evaluating an educational intervention to improve inhaler technique, patients initially demonstrated an average Device Appropriateness Index (DAI) score of 4. The intervention, combining visual aids and personalized feedback, increased the average DAI score to 8. A control group's DAI score remained at 4. The DAI score ranges from 0 to 10. Calculate the absolute increase in the average DAI score of the intervention group that can be attributed to the intervention.</question>

     $$\begin{aligned}
     \text{Absolute increase in DAI score} &= \text{DAI score post-intervention} - \text{DAI score pre-intervention} \\
                                         &= 8 - 4 \\
                                         &= 4
     \end{aligned}$$

    </question>

3.  <question>A researcher is studying the impact of counseling on medication adherence among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Initially, 40% of patients were deemed adherent based on an Adherence Index (AI). Following a 6-month counseling program, the percentage of adherent patients increased to 70%. Assuming a total study population of 150 patients, determine the increase in the number of adherent patients resulting from the counseling intervention.</question>

    $$\begin{aligned}
    \text{Initial number of adherent patients} &= 0.40 \times 150 \\
                                                &= 60
    \end{aligned}$$

    $$\begin{aligned}
    \text{Number of adherent patients after counseling} &= 0.70 \times 150 \\
                                                         &= 105
    \end{aligned}$$

    $$\begin{aligned}
    \text{Increase in number of adherent patients} &= 105 - 60 \\
                                                   &= 45
    \end{aligned}$$

    </question>

4.  <question>A clinical study is investigating the effectiveness of a new inhaler device on drug delivery to the lungs in asthma patients. Pre-intervention, only 30% of the administered drug reached the lungs. Post-intervention, after providing technique training and personalized feedback, lung deposition increased to 60%. If the initial dose of the drug administered via the inhaler is 200 $\mu$g, what is the increase in the amount of drug (in $\mu$g) reaching the lungs as a result of the intervention?</question>

    $$\begin{aligned}
    \text{Initial amount of drug reaching lungs} &= 0.30 \times 200\,\mu\text{g} \\
                                                &= 60\,\mu\text{g}
    \end{aligned}$$

    $$\begin{aligned}
    \text{Amount of drug reaching lungs after intervention} &= 0.60 \times 200\,\mu\text{g} \\
                                                          &= 120\,\mu\text{g}
    \end{aligned}$$

    $$\begin{aligned}
    \text{Increase in amount of drug reaching lungs} &= 120\,\mu\text{g} - 60\,\mu\text{g} \\
                                                     &= 60\,\mu\text{g}
    \end{aligned}$$

    </question>

5.  <question>An asthma clinical trial involved assessing adherence using both the MMAS-8 scale and electronic monitoring of inhaler usage. Patients with an MMAS-8 score of 6 or greater were classified as adherent. In a group of 100 patients, electronic monitoring initially showed 45% adherence. After a comprehensive counseling intervention including tailored education and support, the percentage of patients adherent by electronic monitoring increased to 75%. How many additional patients became adherent due to the intervention, based on electronic monitoring data?</question>

    $$\begin{aligned}
    \text{Initially Adherent Patients} &= 0.45 \times 100 \\
                                        &= 45
    \end{aligned}$$

    $$\begin{aligned}
    \text{Adherent Patients After Intervention} &= 0.75 \times 100 \\
                                                 &= 75
    \end{aligned}$$

    $$\begin{aligned}
    \text{Additional Adherent Patients} &= 75 - 45 \\
                                          &= 30
    \end{aligned}$$

Here's a critique of the provided biology questions based on your guidelines:

**Overall Assessment:**

The questions are well-designed, leveraging real-world biological/clinical scenarios (medication adherence, inhaler technique, drug delivery) to frame quantitative problems. The use of specific indices (MMAS-8, DAI) adds realism. The LaTeX formatting in the provided solutions is consistently excellent, adhering to guidelines 11 and 12. Most questions effectively force multi-step reasoning and clearly ask for a single numerical answer with appropriate units.

**Critique of Individual Questions:**

---

### Question 1

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. A realistic clinical trial context.
*   **Guideline 2 (Expect numerical answer):** Yes, asks for a percentage.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, requires calculating the actual increase, the maximum possible increase, and then the percentage. This is well-executed multi-step reasoning.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Yes, it's a calculation problem.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Yes, the specific context and calculation type make it novel.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes, unambiguous.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Generally good. The phrase "percentage increase in adherence for the intervention group relative to the maximum achievable improvement" is slightly wordy but interpretable.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units, Symbols):** Consistent; percentage is unitless.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):** Yes, asks for a single value.
*   **Guidelines 11 & 12 (Solution Formatting):** Perfectly executed LaTeX and `\begin{aligned}`.

**Actionable Feedback:**
*   **Minor refinement:** Consider rephrasing the concluding sentence for slightly more conciseness, e.g., "Calculate the percentage of the potential adherence improvement achieved by the intervention group."

---

### Question 2

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Good. A relevant clinical scenario.
*   **Guideline 2 (Expect numerical answer):** Yes, asks for an absolute increase.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Fails this guideline.** The calculation is a single subtraction ($8 - 4 = 4$). While the surrounding information (control group, score range) adds biological context, it doesn't necessitate multiple *computational* steps to arrive at the answer.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Yes, it's a calculation.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** The use of DAI is good, but the simplicity of the calculation makes it less unique from a problem-solving perspective.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes, unambiguous.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Clear and concise.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units, Symbols):** Consistent; DAI score is unitless.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):** Yes, asks for a single value.
*   **Guidelines 11 & 12 (Solution Formatting):** Perfectly executed LaTeX and `\begin{aligned}`.

**Actionable Feedback:**
*   **Major improvement needed:** To meet Guideline 3, revise the question to require at least two distinct computational steps. For example, similar to Question 1, ask for the percentage of the *maximum possible* DAI improvement achieved, or incorporate population numbers to calculate total "DAI units" improved.

---

### Question 3

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. Realistic clinical context.
*   **Guideline 2 (Expect numerical answer):** Yes, asks for a number of patients.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, requires calculating initial count, final count, and then the difference. This is effective multi-step reasoning.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Yes, it's a calculation problem.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Good use of percentages and total population.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes, unambiguous.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Clear and concise.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units, Symbols):** Units ("patients") are implied and consistent.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):** Yes, asks for a single value.
*   **Guidelines 11 & 12 (Solution Formatting):** Perfectly executed LaTeX and `\begin{aligned}`.

**Actionable Feedback:**
*   **No significant improvements needed.** This question is well-crafted and adheres to all guidelines.

---

### Question 4

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. Relevant scenario involving drug delivery and lung deposition.
*   **Guideline 2 (Expect numerical answer):** Yes, asks for an amount in $\mu$g.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, requires calculating initial amount, final amount, and then the difference. This is effective multi-step reasoning.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Yes, it's a calculation problem.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Good, novel scenario involving drug percentages and dose.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes, unambiguous.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Clear and concise.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units, Symbols):** Excellent. Correctly uses $\mu$g and ensures consistency.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):** Yes, asks for a single value.
*   **Guidelines 11 & 12 (Solution Formatting):** Perfectly executed LaTeX and `\begin{aligned}`.

**Actionable Feedback:**
*   **No significant improvements needed.** This question is well-crafted and adheres to all guidelines.

---

### Question 5

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. Realistic clinical trial context, including different assessment methods. The inclusion of the MMAS-8 score detail (which is a distractor for the calculation based on electronic monitoring) is a subtle but effective way to assess critical reading.
*   **Guideline 2 (Expect numerical answer):** Yes, asks for a number of patients.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, requires calculating initial count, final count, and then the difference. This is effective multi-step reasoning.

<question>A clinical trial evaluates a new intervention to boost medication adherence in heart failure patients. At baseline, the average score on the Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS) was 4.0. After 6 months, the intervention group's average MARS score rose to 7.0. A control group receiving standard care showed no change, remaining at 4.0. Given that the maximum possible MARS score is 10.0, what percentage of the potential adherence improvement was achieved by the intervention group?</question>

<question>A study examines the effect of a tailored education program on proper inhaler use among asthma patients. Initially, patients exhibited an average Critical Inhaler Technique (CIT) score of 3. The education program increased the average CIT score to 7. A control group's CIT score stayed at 3. The CIT score ranges from 0 to 10. If the study included 75 patients in the intervention group, calculate the total increase in CIT 'points' attributable to the intervention across these patients.</question>

<question>Researchers are investigating the impact of a support group on medication adherence in patients with type 2 diabetes. Initially, 35% of patients were considered adherent based on a validated adherence questionnaire. Following a 12-month support group intervention, the percentage of adherent patients increased to 65%. Assuming a study population of 200 patients, determine the increase in the number of adherent patients resulting from the support group intervention.</question>

<question>A clinical study assesses the efficacy of a novel nebulizer device on pulmonary drug delivery in cystic fibrosis patients. Before the intervention, only 25% of the administered drug reached the lungs. After intervention, including device training and individualized dose adjustments, lung deposition increased to 55%. If the initial dose of the drug administered via the nebulizer is 5 mg, calculate the increase in the amount of drug (in mg) reaching the lungs due to the intervention.</question>

<question>An osteoporosis clinical trial assessed adherence using both the MMAS-8 scale and medication event monitoring system (MEMS) caps. Patients with an MMAS-8 score of 6 or higher were considered adherent. Initially, MEMS data indicated 50% adherence in a group of 80 patients. Following a motivational interviewing intervention combined with weekly text message reminders, the percentage of patients adherent by MEMS increased to 85%. How many additional patients became adherent as a result of the intervention, based on MEMS data?</question>
