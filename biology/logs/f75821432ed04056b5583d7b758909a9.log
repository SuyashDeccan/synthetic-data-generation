Here are some undergraduate biology questions based on your specifications:

1.  <question>A physical therapist is evaluating a patient recovering from a stroke. Baseline gait analysis using Kinovea software shows an average arm swing amplitude of $25^\circ$ during walking. After 4 weeks of Nordic Walking (NW) training, the arm swing amplitude increases by 30%. Assuming arm swing amplitude is directly proportional to stride length, and the initial stride length was 0.8 m, calculate the new stride length after the NW training, to the nearest hundredth of a meter. </question>

2.  <question>A researcher is studying the effects of Nordic Walking (NW) on balance in elderly individuals. Using the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), a participant scores 20 out of 30 before NW training. After 8 weeks of NW, their FGA score improves by 25%. If the FGA score is directly proportional to the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test time, and the initial TUG time was 12 seconds, what is the new TUG test time after NW training, to the nearest tenth of a second?</question>

3.  <question>A patient with Parkinson's disease exhibits a gait speed of $0.6\,\mathrm{m/s}$ and a stride length of $0.5\,\mathrm{m}$. Following a rehabilitation program incorporating arm swing exercises, their gait speed increases by 20% and stride length increases by 15%. Calculate the percentage increase in the cadence (steps per minute) after the rehabilitation program to the nearest whole number. (Hint: Cadence = Gait speed / Stride length * 60)</question>

4.  <question>During a study on gait rehabilitation, a subject's arm swing frequency is observed to increase from 0.8 Hz to 1.2 Hz following an intervention. If the subject's initial stride length was 0.75 m, and assuming that the stride length increases proportionally with the square root of the arm swing frequency, calculate the new stride length after the intervention, to the nearest hundredth of a meter.</question>

5.  <question>A clinician is using Nordic Walking as a rehabilitation strategy for a patient with a neurological disorder. Initially, the patient has a comfortable walking speed of $0.5\,\mathrm{m/s}$. After 6 weeks of NW, their walking speed increases to $0.7\,\mathrm{m/s}$. If the patient's step length increases from 0.6 m, calculate the corresponding change in steps per minute, to the nearest whole number. </question>

Here's a critique of the provided questions, focusing on the specified guidelines and offering actionable feedback:

### Critique of Question 1

*   **Overall Verdict:** Good scenario, but weak on multi-step reasoning.
*   **Guideline 1 (Biology Scenario):** **PASS**. The scenario involving stroke recovery, gait analysis, and Nordic Walking is realistic and integrates biological concepts (gait parameters).
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** **WEAK PASS / BORDERLINE FAIL**. While technically two steps (calculate new amplitude, then apply proportionality), for "directly proportional" with percentage increase, a student can simply apply the 30% increase directly to the initial stride length ($0.8\,\mathrm{m} \times 1.30$). This makes it a very simple, single-calculation problem, not strongly requiring two distinct biological principles or complex steps.
*   **Guideline 5 (Unique):** **PASS**. The specific scenario is novel.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** **PASS**.
*   **Guideline 7 & 9 (Rigorous Phrasing, Units):** **PASS**. Clear and consistent.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To enhance multi-step reasoning, consider a scenario where the relationship isn't a simple direct percentage increase, or introduce an intermediate calculation. For example, "if the energy expenditure is proportional to the square of arm swing amplitude, and arm swing amplitude is proportional to stride length...".

### Critique of Question 2

*   **Overall Verdict:** Fundamentally flawed due to an incorrect biological premise.
*   **Guideline 1 (Biology Scenario):** **PASS** (on setup), but **FAIL** (on conceptual understanding). The scenario itself is realistic (NW, elderly, balance, FGA, TUG).
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** **FAIL**. The core premise "FGA score is directly proportional to the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test time" is biologically incorrect. A higher FGA score indicates better balance, while a *lower* (faster) TUG time indicates better mobility. Thus, these measures are *inversely* related in terms of positive patient outcomes. This flaw means a biologically informed student would be confused or unable to answer correctly without ignoring biological reality.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** **FAIL**. The biological inaccuracy creates ambiguity; a student following the literal mathematical instruction would get a biologically illogical result.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous Phrasing):** **FAIL**. The phrasing, while concise, contains a critical biological inaccuracy, making it misleading.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Correct the biological relationship. Change "directly proportional" to "inversely proportional" for FGA score and TUG time. Alternatively, use two measures that are indeed directly proportional, or introduce an indirect relationship.

### Critique of Question 3

*   **Overall Verdict:** Excellent. Meets all specified guidelines.
*   **Guideline 1 (Biology Scenario):** **PASS**. Realistic context of Parkinson's disease and gait rehabilitation.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** **STRONG PASS**. Requires several distinct calculations: initial gait speed and stride length changes, calculation of initial cadence, calculation of new cadence, and finally, the percentage increase in cadence. This clearly involves multiple steps and principles.
*   **Guideline 5 (Unique):** **PASS**. The combination of gait parameters and percentage changes makes it a unique problem.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** **PASS**.
*   **Guideline 7 & 9 (Rigorous Phrasing, Units):** **PASS**. The question is clear, professional, and units are consistent. The hint is helpful and accurate.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** No significant improvements needed. This is a model question.

### Critique of Question 4

*   **Overall Verdict:** Very good. Unique relationship requiring careful application of proportionality.
*   **Guideline 1 (Biology Scenario):** **PASS**. Relevant to gait rehabilitation and biomechanics.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** **PASS**. It requires calculating the ratio of frequencies, taking the square root, and then applying this factor to the initial stride length. This is a good multi-step application of a defined proportionality.
*   **Guideline 5 (Unique):** **PASS**. The "square root of the arm swing frequency" proportionality makes this problem less standard and more conceptually rich.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** **PASS**.
*   **Guideline 7 & 9 (Rigorous Phrasing, Units):** **PASS**. Clear, concise, and consistent units.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** No significant improvements needed.

### Critique of Question 5

*   **Overall Verdict:** Unsolvable due to missing information.
*   **Guideline 1 (Biology Scenario):** **PASS** (on setup). Relevant to rehabilitation.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** **FAIL**. The question is unsolvable because the new step length is not provided. To calculate the "corresponding change in steps per minute," both the initial and final step lengths are required, or a relationship that allows the calculation of the final step length.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** **FAIL**. Cannot be solved.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous Phrasing):** **FAIL**. The phrasing "If the patient's step length increases from 0.6 m" sets an initial condition but fails to provide the crucial post-intervention step length.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Provide the new step length (e.g., "increases to 0.7 m") or provide a percentage/factor by which it changes (e.g., "increases by 10%").

Here's a critique of the provided biology assessment questions, evaluated against your guidelines:

**General Feedback:**
Overall, these questions demonstrate a good grasp of creating plausible biological scenarios and requiring numerical, multi-step calculations. They are generally concise and aim for single, clear solutions. However, a common area for improvement across several questions is the depth of "biological principles" required. Often, these principles are presented as direct mathematical proportionality rules (e.g., X is proportional to the square of Y), rather than requiring the student to apply more complex or integrated biological concepts, models, or formulas derived from biological understanding. Questions 3 and 5 are the strongest in this regard, as they utilize fundamental biomechanical relationships (like cadence calculation) as core principles.

**Critique of Individual Questions:**

1.  <question>A physical therapist is evaluating a patient recovering from a stroke. Baseline gait analysis using Kinovea software shows an average arm swing amplitude of $25^\circ$ during walking, with an energy expenditure of 150 Joules/step. After 4 weeks of Nordic Walking (NW) training, the arm swing amplitude increases by 30%. If energy expenditure is directly proportional to the *square* of the arm swing amplitude, and arm swing amplitude is directly proportional to stride length, calculate the new stride length after the NW training, to the nearest hundredth of a meter. The initial stride length was 0.8 m.</question>

    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. Real-world scenario with relevant clinical terms (stroke, Kinovea, Nordic Walking).
    *   **Guideline 2 (Expect numerical answer):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, it involves calculating new arm swing amplitude, then applying a proportionality to find new stride length.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Yes, it's a calculation.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Yes, the specific combination of parameters and relationships is novel.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Generally good, but contains extraneous information.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units consistent):** Yes, units are consistent and specified.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):** Yes, single target quantity.

    **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   **Major Issue - Extraneous Information (Violates Guideline 7 & potentially 3):** The information about "energy expenditure of 150 Joules/step" and "energy expenditure is directly proportional to the *square* of the arm swing amplitude" is completely irrelevant to calculating the new stride length given the direct proportionality between arm swing amplitude and stride length. This unnecessarily complicates the problem, potentially confusing students, and violates the principle of concise phrasing. **Remove this information.**
    *   **Improve Biological Depth (Guideline 3):** While the relationships are stated, the "biological principle" is essentially a given mathematical proportionality. Consider if a more complex biological principle or an additional step requiring deeper conceptual understanding could be integrated, rather than just direct mathematical translation of a stated rule.

2.  <question>A researcher is studying the effects of Nordic Walking (NW) on balance in elderly individuals. Using the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), a participant scores 20 out of 30 before NW training. After 8 weeks of NW, their FGA score improves by 25%. If the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test time is *inversely* proportional to the FGA score, and the initial TUG time was 12 seconds, what is the new TUG test time after NW training, to the nearest tenth of a second?</question>

    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. Uses real assessments (FGA, TUG) and a relevant intervention (NW) for a specific population.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Expect numerical answer):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, calculate new FGA, then apply inverse proportionality.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Very good.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units consistent):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):** Yes.

    **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   **Improve Biological Depth (Guideline 3):** Similar to Q1, the "biological principle" is a given mathematical relationship (inverse proportionality). While realistic, it doesn't require a deeper biological conceptual understanding beyond translating the relationship mathematically. To strengthen this, one could potentially allude to *why* this relationship exists (e.g., improved neural processing speed impacting both tests), or connect it to another biological metric. However, for the current structure, it's acceptable.

3.  <question>A patient with Parkinson's disease exhibits a gait speed of $0.6\,\mathrm{m/s}$ and a stride length of $0.5\,\mathrm{m}$. Following a rehabilitation program incorporating arm swing exercises, their gait speed increases by 20% and stride length increases by 15%. Calculate the percentage increase in the cadence (steps per minute) after the rehabilitation program to the nearest whole number. (Hint: Cadence = Gait speed / Stride length * 60)</question>

    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. Relevant patient population (Parkinson's), intervention, and gait parameters.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Expect numerical answer):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Excellent. Requires calculation of new speed and stride length, then applying a fundamental biomechanical formula (cadence) twice, and finally calculating a percentage change. This strongly fulfills multi-step reasoning with a core "biological/biomechanical principle."
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Excellent. The hint is appropriate for an assessment setting.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units consistent):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):** Yes.

    **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   This question is exceptionally well-designed and meets all guidelines effectively. No significant changes needed.

4.  <question>During a study on gait rehabilitation, a subject's arm swing frequency is observed to increase from 0.8 Hz to 1.2 Hz following an intervention. If the subject's initial stride length was 0.75 m, and assuming that the stride length increases proportionally with the square root of the arm swing frequency, calculate the new stride length after the intervention, to the nearest hundredth of a meter.</question>

    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Good. Generic gait rehabilitation scenario.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Expect numerical answer):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, involves calculating a ratio and applying the square root proportionality.

    *   **Guideline 9 (Units consistent):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):** Yes.

    **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   **Improve Biological Depth (Guideline 3):** Similar to Q1 and Q2, the core "biological principle" is a given mathematical proportionality. While plausible, this specific "square root" relationship between arm swing frequency and stride length is likely a hypothetical construct for the problem rather than a universally accepted biological law. To improve, one could embed this within a broader biological context that requires more than direct mathematical application of a stated rule, or integrate another biological principle into the calculation.

5.  <question>A clinician is using Nordic Walking as a rehabilitation strategy for a patient with a neurological disorder. Initially, the patient has a comfortable walking speed of $0.5\,\mathrm{m/s}$. After 6 weeks of NW, their walking speed increases to $0.7\,\mathrm{m/s}$. If the patient's step length increases from 0.6 m to 0.7 m, calculate the corresponding change in steps per minute, to the nearest whole number.</question>

    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. Relevant clinical context (NW, neurological disorder) and parameters.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Expect numerical answer):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Excellent. Requires calculating initial and final steps per minute using the fundamental kinematic relationship (cadence = speed / step length), then finding the change. This strongly fulfills the guideline.

    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Excellent.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units consistent):** Yes.
