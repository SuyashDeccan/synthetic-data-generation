Here are some novel, undergraduate-level biology questions based on your specified criteria:

<question>A patient with a mandibular fracture undergoes open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) followed by maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) using arch bars. Post-operatively, the patient reports a pain score of $6.5$ on a $0-10$ visual analog scale (VAS). Removal of the MMF is planned for 6 weeks post-surgery. If it is observed that the average daily discomfort score decreases linearly from the initial score to $2.0$ after the fixation removal, calculate the *total* discomfort experienced by the patient during the fixation period, expressed in VAS-days (i.e., the integral of the discomfort score over time). </question>

<question>In a clinical trial comparing MMF using arch bars versus MMF using bone screws for mandibular fracture management, 50 patients are randomized to each group. At 2 weeks post-fixation, 15 patients in the arch bar group and 5 patients in the bone screw group exhibit moderate gingival inflammation (defined as a score of 2 on a 0-3 inflammation scale). Calculate the *relative risk* of developing moderate gingival inflammation in patients treated with arch bars compared to bone screws.</question>

<question>A patient presents with a displaced mandibular angle fracture. The surgeon decides to use closed reduction followed by MMF with elastics. The elastics exert a force of $1.5\,\mathrm{N}$ per side. Assuming the mandible acts as a lever system with a mechanical advantage of $0.7$, and that complete reduction requires a force of $3.0\,\mathrm{N}$ applied at the fracture site, determine the *minimum number of elastics* needed *per side* to achieve adequate fracture reduction. </question>

<question>A study investigates the efficacy of MMF in stabilizing mandibular fractures. A cohort of 80 patients with similar fractures is treated with MMF for 4 weeks. After MMF removal, 5 patients experience re-displacement of the fracture. If the *failure rate* (re-displacement) of MMF is assumed to follow a binomial distribution, calculate the estimated failure rate (%) of MMF in this patient population, expressing your answer as a percentage to two decimal places. </question>

<question>Two groups of patients with mandibular fractures are compared: one treated with MMF alone and another treated with MMF in conjunction with low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS). The average time to radiographic union in the MMF-alone group is 8 weeks, while in the MMF + LIPUS group it is 6 weeks. Calculate the *percentage reduction* in healing time achieved by adding LIPUS to MMF treatment. </question>

Assuming the mandible acts as a lever system with a mechanical advantage of $0.7$, and that complete reduction requires a force of $3.0\,\mathrm{N}$ applied at the fracture site, determine the *minimum number of elastics* needed *per side* to achieve adequate fracture reduction. </question>

**Critique:**
*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** **Strong.** Integrates biomechanics (lever systems, mechanical advantage) into a direct clinical/anatomical context.
*   **2. Expect answers of single word answer, numerical answer:** **Strong.** Expects a numerical answer.

<question>A study investigates the efficacy of MMF in stabilizing mandibular fractures. A cohort of 80 patients with similar fractures is treated with MMF for 4 weeks. After MMF removal, 5 patients experience re-displacement of the fracture. If the *failure rate* (re-displacement) of MMF is assumed to follow a binomial distribution, calculate the estimated failure rate (%) of MMF in this patient population, expressing your answer as a percentage to two decimal places. </question>

**Critique:**
*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** **Strong.** Represents a clinical study and outcome.
*   **2. Expect answers of single word answer, numerical answer:** **Strong.** Expects a numerical percentage.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** **Weak.** The question asks for the "estimated failure rate," which in this context is simply the observed proportion ($5/80$) converted to a percentage. This is a single, very basic arithmetic step. The mention of "binomial distribution" is a distractor as it's not used to *estimate* the failure rate from observed data (the observed proportion is the maximum likelihood estimator for $p$ in a binomial distribution). To genuinely force multi-step reasoning related to the binomial distribution, the question would need to ask for something like the probability of observing a certain number of failures, or a confidence interval for the failure rate.
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** **Strong.** Asks for a calculation.
*   **5. Be Unique:** **Moderate.** The scenario is unique, but the core calculation is extremely basic. The binomial distribution mention adds a layer that might mislead or be irrelevant to the requested calculation.
*   **6. Single Solution:** **Strong.** Yields a single, unambiguous numerical result.
*   **7. Rigorous, concise phrasing:** **Strong.** Clear.
*   **9. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional biology notation:** **Strong.** Percentage is an appropriate unit. Numerical values are correctly formatted.
*   **10. Questions must not be multipart:** **Strong.** Focuses on a single target quantity: estimated failure rate.
*   **11. Solution Formatting (LaTeX in question):** **Strong.** All numerical values are correctly enclosed in `$...$`.

**Overall Feedback:** This question needs improvement to truly meet the "Force Multi-Step Reasoning" criterion and to avoid potentially misleading information.
**Actionable Feedback:** To improve, either:
1.  **Remove the "binomial distribution" clause** if the intent is solely to test basic proportion calculation.
2.  **Rephrase the question to genuinely require knowledge of the binomial distribution** for calculation (e.g., "Assuming the true failure rate is $X\%$, calculate the probability of observing *exactly* 5 failures in a cohort of 80 patients," or "Calculate the $95\%$ confidence interval for the failure rate, assuming a binomial distribution and using the normal approximation"). This would elevate it to a more complex statistical reasoning problem.

The average time to radiographic union in the MMF-alone group is 8 weeks, while in the MMF + LIPUS group it is 6 weeks. Calculate the *percentage reduction* in healing time achieved by adding LIPUS to MMF treatment. </question>

**Critique:**
*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** **Strong.** Represents a clinical comparison of treatment efficacy on a biological process (bone healing).
*   **2. Expect answers of single word answer, numerical answer:** **Strong.** Expects a numerical percentage.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** **Strong.** Requires calculating the absolute difference and then converting that difference to a percentage of the original value. This is a common and useful quantitative skill in biology.
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** **Strong.** Asks for a calculation.
*   **5. Be Unique:** **Strong.** The specific clinical context makes it unique from a standard textbook "percentage change" problem.
*   **6. Single Solution:** **Strong.** Yields a single, unambiguous numerical result.
*   **7. Rigorous, concise phrasing:** **Strong.** Clear and professional.
*   **9. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional biology notation:** **Strong.** Time in weeks, result in percentage, which is appropriate. Numerical values are correctly formatted.
*   **10. Questions must not be multipart:** **Strong.** Focuses on a single target quantity: percentage reduction.
*   **11. Solution Formatting (LaTeX in question):** **Strong.** All numerical values are correctly enclosed in `$...$`.

Here are the refined questions, with a focus on strengthening the biological reasoning component in Question 1, based on the provided feedback:

<question>A patient with a mandibular fracture undergoes open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) followed by maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) using arch bars. Post-operatively, the patient reports a pain score of $6.5$ on a $0-10$ visual analog scale (VAS). MMF removal is planned for 6 weeks post-surgery. The average daily discomfort score decreases linearly, reflecting a combination of bone healing and soft tissue adaptation. Discomfort improves to $2.0$ *only after* MMF removal due to increased oral function and decreased muscle fatigue. Assuming this linear decrease starts immediately post-surgery and continues until MMF removal, calculate the *total* discomfort experienced by the patient during the fixation period, expressed in VAS-days (i.e., the integral of the discomfort score over time).</question>

<question>In a clinical trial comparing MMF using arch bars versus MMF using bone screws for mandibular fracture management, $50$ patients are randomized to each group. At $2$ weeks post-fixation, $15$ patients in the arch bar group and $5$ patients in the bone screw group exhibit moderate gingival inflammation (defined as a score of $2$ on a $0-3$ inflammation scale). Calculate the *relative risk* of developing moderate gingival inflammation in patients treated with arch bars compared to bone screws.</question>
