Here are some novel, undergraduate-level biology questions based on the provided topics, key concepts, and guidelines:

<question>
A researcher is analyzing endometrial biopsies from a cohort of patients. 20% of samples from patients with simple hyperplasia without atypia show complete loss of PAX2 expression. In patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma, 75% of samples show complete loss of PAX2 expression. If the total number of patients with simple hyperplasia without atypia is 120 and the total number of patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma is 80, what is the difference in the number of patients showing *complete* PAX2 loss between the two groups?
</question>

<question>
An immunohistochemical analysis of PAX2 expression in endometrial tissue sections is performed. PAX2 staining intensity is graded on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0 represents complete loss and 3 represents strong, diffuse staining. In a cohort of 50 patients, the average PAX2 staining intensity in the proliferative phase endometrium is 2.5, and in endometrioid adenocarcinoma tissue from the same cohort, the average staining intensity is 0.8. Assuming a linear correlation between PAX2 staining intensity and the percentage of normal PAX2 expression, what is the estimated percent decrease in PAX2 expression from proliferative phase to endometrioid adenocarcinoma, rounded to the nearest whole number percent?
</question>

<question>
A study investigates the diagnostic accuracy of PAX2 immunohistochemistry in distinguishing between benign endometrium and endometrioid adenocarcinoma. In a cohort of patients, PAX2 expression is completely lost (score of 0) in 60 out of 100 endometrioid adenocarcinoma samples. In the same cohort, 10 out of 100 benign endometrial samples also show complete loss of PAX2 expression due to technical artifacts. What is the false positive rate of complete PAX2 loss for diagnosing endometrioid adenocarcinoma in this cohort? Express your answer as a percentage.

<question>
A researcher is quantifying PAX2 protein levels in endometrial cells using Western blotting. In normal endometrial tissue, the PAX2 protein concentration is found to be $1.6\\,\\mathrm{ng/\\mu L}$. In endometrioid adenocarcinoma tissue, the PAX2 protein concentration is $0.4\\,\\mathrm{ng/\\mu L}$. Calculate the fold change decrease in PAX2 protein concentration from normal to cancerous tissue.

Here is a critique of each question, providing concise and actionable feedback for improvement:

**Question 1 Critique:**

<question>
A researcher is analyzing endometrial biopsies from a cohort of patients. 20% of samples from patients with simple hyperplasia without atypia show complete loss of PAX2 expression. In patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma, 75% of samples show complete loss of PAX2 expression. If the total number of patients with simple hyperplasia without atypia is 120 and the total number of patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma is 80, what is the difference in the number of patients showing *complete* PAX2 loss between the two groups?
</question>

*   **Meets Guidelines:** 1 (Biology Scenario), 2 (Numerical Answer), 4 (Avoid How-based), 6 (Single Solution), 7 (Rigorous Phrasing), 9 (Units/Notation - implicit "number of patients"), 10 (Not Multipart).
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** While technically multi-step (calculate two numbers, then find the difference), the reasoning is purely arithmetic and basic percentage calculation. It does not integrate multiple *biological principles* or require complex conceptual translation.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** This is a very common quantitative problem structure, merely contextualized with biological terms. It lacks novelty for an undergraduate biology assessment.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To enhance this question, consider integrating a deeper biological concept. For example, ask about the diagnostic *implication* of this difference (e.g., how useful PAX2 loss is as a biomarker for differentiation, requiring interpretation of data beyond simple calculation) or involve a step of normalizing data or comparing rates across different baseline prevalences, which might necessitate a more biological interpretation. As is, it's more of a quantitative literacy check.

**Question 2 Critique:**

<question>
An immunohistochemical analysis of PAX2 expression in endometrial tissue sections is performed. PAX2 staining intensity is graded on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0 represents complete loss and 3 represents strong, diffuse staining. In a cohort of 50 patients, the average PAX2 staining intensity in the proliferative phase endometrium is 2.5, and in endometrioid adenocarcinoma tissue from the same cohort, the average staining intensity is 0.8. Assuming a linear correlation between PAX2 staining intensity and the percentage of normal PAX2 expression, what is the estimated percent decrease in PAX2 expression from proliferative phase to endometrioid adenocarcinoma, rounded to the nearest whole number percent?
</question>

*   **Meets Guidelines:** 1 (Biology Scenario - Excellent), 2 (Numerical Answer), 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning - Good), 4 (Avoid How-based), 5 (Be Unique - Good), 6 (Single Solution), 7 (Rigorous Phrasing), 9 (Units/Notation), 10 (Not Multipart).
*   **Weaknesses:** None significant.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** This is a strong question. It effectively combines a realistic biological assay (IHC scoring), data interpretation (linear correlation assumption), and multi-step quantitative reasoning (converting scale to percentage, then calculating percent decrease). It aligns well with the undergraduate level and provides a good assessment of quantitative skills in a biological context.

**Question 3 Critique:**

<question>
A study investigates the diagnostic accuracy of PAX2 immunohistochemistry in distinguishing between benign endometrium and endometrioid adenocarcinoma. In a cohort of patients, PAX2 expression is completely lost (score of 0) in 60 out of 100 endometrioid adenocarcinoma samples. In the same cohort, 10 out of 100 benign endometrial samples also show complete loss of PAX2 expression due to technical artifacts. What is the false positive rate of complete PAX2 loss for diagnosing endometrioid adenocarcinoma in this cohort? Express your answer as a percentage.
</question>

*   **Meets Guidelines:** 1 (Biology Scenario - Excellent), 2 (Numerical Answer), 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning - Good), 4 (Avoid How-based), 5 (Be Unique - Good), 6 (Single Solution), 7 (Rigorous Phrasing), 9 (Units/Notation), 10 (Not Multipart).
*   **Weaknesses:** None significant.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** This is an excellent question. It directly tests a crucial concept in translational biology and diagnostics: the false positive rate. It requires students to understand the components of diagnostic accuracy within a realistic context and apply a specific formula/definition. The inclusion of "technical artifacts" as a reason for loss of expression in benign samples adds a layer of realism without overcomplicating the core calculation.

**Question 4 Critique:**

<question>
A researcher is quantifying PAX2 protein levels in endometrial cells using Western blotting. In normal endometrial tissue, the PAX2 protein concentration is found to be $1.6\\,\\mathrm{ng/\\mu L}$. In endometrioid adenocarcinoma tissue, the PAX2 protein concentration is $0.4\\,\\mathrm{ng/\\mu L}$. Calculate the fold change decrease in PAX2 protein concentration from normal to cancerous tissue.
</question>

*   **Meets Guidelines:** 1 (Biology Scenario), 2 (Numerical Answer), 4 (Avoid How-based), 6 (Single Solution), 7 (Rigorous Phrasing), 9 (Units/Notation - correct LaTeX for units), 10 (Not Multipart), 11 (LaTeX for units in question).
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Calculating "fold change" is a single division operation. While it requires knowing the definition, it doesn't involve multiple distinct calculation steps or integration of multiple biological principles beyond the initial context setting. It's computationally very simple.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Calculating fold change is a very standard and common problem in molecular biology, making it less unique than desired for a novel question set.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** To improve, increase the complexity of the calculation or the biological interpretation required. For example, integrate a standard curve calculation, normalization to a loading control (requiring multiple values to be processed), or ask for a calculation that combines concentration with another biological factor (e.g., total protein in a specific tissue mass, requiring unit conversion). This would elevate it beyond a single-step arithmetic problem.

**Question 5 Critique:**

<question>
Endometrial biopsy samples are collected from 50 patients undergoing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and 50 patients with no HRT. Among the HRT group, 10% demonstrate loss of PAX2 expression. Among the non-HRT group, 30% demonstrate loss of PAX2 expression. What is the absolute difference in the number of patients showing loss of PAX2 expression between the two groups?
</question>

*   **Meets Guidelines:** 1 (Biology Scenario), 2 (Numerical Answer), 4 (Avoid How-based), 6 (Single Solution), 7 (Rigorous Phrasing), 9 (Units/Notation - implicit "number of patients"), 10 (Not Multipart).
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Identical to Question 1, this is purely arithmetic. It lacks the integration of deeper biological principles or complex conceptual reasoning beyond basic percentage calculations.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** This question is structurally and cognitively almost identical to Question 1. Having two such similar questions in one set reduces the overall assessment breadth and novelty.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** This question should either be replaced or significantly modified to provide distinct value from Question 1. If kept, it needs to incorporate a more complex biological interpretation or calculation. For instance, ask about relative risk or odds ratio, or integrate dosage-response data, requiring a different set of quantitative skills or biological inferences.

Key improvements and explanations:

*   **Question 1 (PPV Calculation):** This question now asks for the *positive predictive value* (PPV), a key concept in diagnostic testing. It requires understanding true positives, false positives, and the PPV formula. It's directly relevant to the use of PAX2 in diagnostics.

*   **Question 2 (Estrogen and Cell Viability):** This question combines estrogen signaling, PAX2 expression, cell viability, and fold change calculations. The key is understanding that the fold change in mRNA levels must be adjusted for the change in cell viability to get a *net* effect per viable cell. This requires more complex reasoning than a simple fold change calculation.

*   **Question 3 (Bayes' Theorem):** This question introduces Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of a diagnosis given PAX2 loss.  It's a more sophisticated application of probability and directly addresses a clinically relevant scenario. It requires students to apply a more complex equation and consider prevalence rates.

*   **Question 4 (ChIP-qPCR and Transcription Factor Binding):** This question incorporates a more complex molecular biology technique (ChIP-qPCR) and the concept of binding affinity (Kd).  It requires students to understand how TF concentration and Kd influence promoter occupancy and then calculate a percentage decrease.  This is a step beyond simple concentration calculations.

*   **Question 5 (Synergistic Effect):** This question introduces the concept of drug synergy and requires students to calculate a synergistic coefficient.  It's a more sophisticated concept than simply adding effects and requires them to understand how to quantify synergy.

Changes Made:

*   **Incorporated Feedback on Multi-Step Reasoning:** Each question now requires multiple distinct steps of reasoning and calculation, often involving integration of different biological concepts.
*   **Addressed Uniqueness:** The questions are designed to be more novel and less formulaic than the original set.  They involve more complex scenarios and calculations.
*   **Increased Biological Context:** The questions are all embedded in realistic and biologically relevant contexts, making them more engaging and meaningful.
*   **Removed Redundancy:**  Questions 1 and 5 were the most similar in the original list.  Both of those have been heavily modified to ask very different things.
*   **Maintained Adherence to Guidelines:**  The questions still adhere to all the original guidelines (numerical answer, avoid how-based, single solution, rigorous phrasing, units/notation, not multipart, LaTeX for units).
=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of the provided questions, focusing on their adherence to the specified guidelines and offering actionable feedback.

---

**Critique of Question 1: PPV Calculation**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Excellent Biological Scenario:** Highly realistic diagnostic lab context, directly applicable to medical diagnostics.
    *   **Numerical & Multi-Step:** Requires identifying true positives/false positives and then applying the PPV formula, fulfilling the multi-step requirement.
    *   **Clear & Concise:** Well-phrased, unambiguous, and asks for a single, specific numerical answer.
    *   **Unique:** Specific biological context (PAX2 loss in endometrioid adenocarcinoma) makes it distinct.
*   **Areas for Minor Improvement:**
    *   **LaTeX for Numbers/Units (Minor):** While not strictly necessary for simple counts ("100 samples"), for full adherence to guideline 11, complex units or variables within the question text (if they were present) should use LaTeX, e.g., `$5\, \mathrm{false\, positives}$`. However, for a question of this type, the current plain text is perfectly clear.

*   **Overall:** An exceptionally well-designed question that effectively assesses diagnostic calculation skills in a relevant biological context.

---

**Critique of Question 2: Estrogen and Cell Viability**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Excellent Biological Scenario:** Models a realistic cell culture experiment investigating gene expression and viability.
    *   **Forces Multi-Step Reasoning:** Crucially requires integrating the mRNA fold change with the cell viability reduction to calculate a *net* effect, demonstrating deeper understanding beyond simple ratio calculations. This is a strong point.
    *   **Unique:** The combination of mRNA expression and viability adjustment makes this problem novel and conceptually rich.
    *   **Clear & Concise:** Rigorously phrased with a single, unambiguous numerical target.
*   **Areas for Minor Improvement:**
    *   **LaTeX for Numbers/Units (Minor):** Similar to Question 1, the numerical values (`1 nM`, `10 nM`, `1.5-fold`, `2.5-fold`, `20%`) are simple enough that plain text is highly readable. For strict adherence to guideline 11, concentrations could be `$1\, \mathrm{nM}$`, etc.

*   **Overall:** A very strong question that demands careful logical reasoning and integration of distinct biological data points.

---

**Critique of Question 3: Bayes' Theorem**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Excellent Biological Scenario:** Highly relevant clinical application of probability in pathology differentiation, very realistic.
    *   **Forces Multi-Step Reasoning:** Directly applies Bayes' Theorem, which inherently involves multiple steps (calculating prior probabilities, likelihoods, and marginal probabilities). The hint is helpful but doesn't simplify the core calculation.
    *   **Unique:** The specific context of PAX2 in endometrial polyps makes it a unique application of a common statistical principle.
    *   **Clear & Concise:** Well-defined parameters and a single, clear target quantity.
*   **Areas for Minor Improvement:**
    *   **LaTeX for Numbers/Units (Minor):** Probabilities (`80%`, `60%`, `15%`) are unitless percentages, so plain text is suitable and clear.

*   **Overall:** An outstanding question that assesses a crucial statistical tool (Bayes' Theorem) within a meaningful clinical biology context.

---

**Critique of Question 4: ChIP-qPCR and Transcription Factor Binding (Kd)**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Excellent Biological Scenario:** Models a specific molecular biology experiment (ChIP-qPCR) and incorporates fundamental biochemical concepts like binding affinity (Kd) and occupancy.
    *   **Forces Multi-Step Reasoning:** Requires calculating occupancy for two different conditions and then determining the percentage decrease, demonstrating a multi-step calculation.
    *   **Unique:** The application of binding kinetics to differential gene regulation in cancer cells is a strong, novel problem.
    *   **Clear & Concise:** Rigorously phrased and asks for a single numerical answer.
*   **Areas for Improvement (Actionable Feedback):**
    *   **LaTeX for Variables and Units (Important for Guideline 11):**
        *   `Kd` should ideally be formatted as `$K_d$` to represent it as a variable/constant in mathematical context.
        *   Concentrations like `5 nM` and `20 nM` should be formatted using LaTeX for units, e.g., `$5\, \mathrm{nM}$` and `$20\, \mathrm{nM}$`.
        *   The formula for occupancy should also be presented in LaTeX for clarity and consistency, e.g., `Assuming that the occupancy of the PAX2 promoter by TF-X is directly proportional to $\frac{\text{[TF-X]}}{K_d + \text{[TF-X]}}$...`

*   **Overall:** A strong conceptual question. Adhering more strictly to LaTeX formatting for variables and units will elevate it to full compliance with the guidelines.

---

**Critique of Question 5: Synergistic Effect**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Excellent Biological Scenario:** Models a realistic drug combination study in cancer cells, investigating pharmacological synergy.
    *   **Forces Multi-Step Reasoning:** Requires calculating the expected additive effect first, then dividing the observed effect by it, a clear two-step process.
    *   **Unique:** Quantifying synergy is a relevant and distinct concept in pharmacology.
    *   **Clear & Concise:** Rigorously phrased and asks for a single, specific numerical answer.
*   **Areas for Minor Improvement:**
    *   **LaTeX for Numbers/Units (Minor):** Percentages (`30%`, `20%`, `60%`) are straightforward; plain text is sufficient for clarity.

*   **Overall:** A well-constructed question that introduces and assesses the concept of drug synergy effectively.

**Summary of Overall Feedback:**

The set of questions is a significant improvement, demonstrating strong adherence to almost all specified guidelines. Each question is well-contextualized within biology, demands multi-step reasoning, and has a clear single numerical solution. The phrasing is rigorous and concise.

The primary area for minor improvement across the set, particularly highlighted in Question 4, is to ensure strict adherence to the LaTeX formatting guidelines for variables and units within the *question text itself* (Guideline 11: "Replace `\\(...\\)` with `$...$`... `$\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$`"). While simple numbers and percentages are clear in plain text, using LaTeX for all numerical values with units (e.g., `5\, \mathrm{nM}`) and for mathematical symbols/variables (e.g., `$K_d$`) would bring the questions into full compliance with the most stringent interpretation of the formatting guidelines.
