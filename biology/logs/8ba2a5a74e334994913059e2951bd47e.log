Here are some novel, multi-step reasoning biology questions suitable for undergraduate level, following all specified guidelines:

<question>A researcher is investigating the prevalence of *Escherichia coli* strains exhibiting gas-forming capabilities in patients with Emphysematous Pyelonephritis (EPN). A sample of 200 patients diagnosed with EPN was analyzed. It was determined that 75% of the EPN cases were classified as Class 2. Further analysis revealed that 80% of the Class 2 EPN cases were associated with gas-forming *E. coli*. How many of the 200 patients diagnosed with EPN were found to have Class 2 EPN associated with gas-forming *E. coli*?</question>

<question>A hospital is evaluating the impact of minimally invasive management strategies on mortality rates in EPN patients. A retrospective study compared 150 patients who underwent open surgical nephrectomy with 250 patients who received minimally invasive interventions. The mortality rate in the surgical group was 32%, while the minimally invasive group exhibited a mortality rate of 18%. Calculate the difference in the number of deaths between the two groups.</question>

<question>A clinical trial is examining the effectiveness of a novel renal-preserving treatment for EPN in diabetic patients. The trial enrolled 120 patients with diabetes mellitus and EPN. After treatment, 65% of the patients showed complete resolution of the EPN without requiring nephrectomy, while the remaining patients required nephrectomy. How many patients in the trial required nephrectomy?</question>

<question>A researcher is developing a diagnostic imaging protocol to improve the accuracy of EPN diagnosis. Using a new imaging technique, they correctly identified 92 out of 100 confirmed EPN cases. What is the sensitivity of this new imaging technique, expressed as a percentage?</question>

<question>A study is conducted to investigate the relationship between pre-existing comorbidities and EPN severity. Out of 300 EPN patients, 180 had diabetes mellitus. Among those with diabetes, 120 were classified as having severe (Class 3 or 4) EPN. If the proportion of severe EPN cases in diabetic patients is representative of the overall population, how many EPN patients out of the total 300 would be expected to have severe EPN, given the rate in diabetic patients?</question>

As a biology assessment expert, I've reviewed your novel, multi-step reasoning biology questions for undergraduate level. While the questions are well-phrased and numerical, they primarily test quantitative reasoning rather than requiring the integration of multiple distinct biological principles as specified by the guidelines. The "multi-step reasoning" is largely arithmetic.

Here's a critique of each question with actionable feedback:

<question>A researcher is investigating the prevalence of *Escherichia coli* strains exhibiting gas-forming capabilities in patients with Emphysematous Pyelonephritis (EPN). A sample of 200 patients diagnosed with EPN was analyzed. It was determined that 75% of the EPN cases were classified as Class 2. Further analysis revealed that 80% of the Class 2 EPN cases were associated with gas-forming *E. coli*. How many of the 200 patients diagnosed with EPN were found to have Class 2 EPN associated with gas-forming *E. coli*?</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Met. Realistic medical context.
*   **Guideline 2 (Numerical Answer):** Met.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Partially met. It is multi-step arithmetically (200 * 0.75, then result * 0.80), but does not involve two or more distinct *biological principles* beyond basic prevalence calculation.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Not fully met. The calculation structure (percentage of a percentage) is a very common quantitative problem, not conceptually novel for biology.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units):** Met, "patients" is appropriate.

**Actionable Feedback:**
To enhance "multi-step biological reasoning" and "uniqueness," consider adding a subsequent biological step. For example, after identifying the number of patients with gas-forming *E. coli*, ask for the expected number of patients requiring a specific intervention (e.g., immediate percutaneous drainage) if only a certain fraction of those *E. coli*-associated cases reach a critical threshold for that intervention due to their gas production mechanism. This would link prevalence to clinical management or pathophysiological consequence.

<question>A hospital is evaluating the impact of minimally invasive management strategies on mortality rates in EPN patients. A retrospective study compared 150 patients who underwent open surgical nephrectomy with 250 patients who received minimally invasive interventions. The mortality rate in the surgical group was 32%, while the minimally invasive group exhibited a mortality rate of 18%. Calculate the difference in the number of deaths between the two groups.</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Met. Realistic clinical study context.
*   **Guideline 2 (Numerical Answer):** Met.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Partially met. It's arithmetically multi-step (calculate deaths in each group, then subtract), but doesn't integrate multiple distinct biological principles beyond basic mortality rate application.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Not fully met. Calculating deaths based on rates and finding the difference is a very standard quantitative comparison.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units):** Met, "deaths" is appropriate.

**Actionable Feedback:**
To deepen the biological reasoning, consider linking mortality to a biological outcome or a patient characteristic. For instance, if a specific comorbidity (e.g., severe sepsis) contributed to X% of deaths in the surgical group but only Y% in the minimally invasive group, how many deaths related to that comorbidity were *avoided* with the new strategy? This would introduce a consideration of patient characteristics/complications alongside treatment efficacy. Alternatively, pose a question about the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) to prevent one death, which involves more conceptual steps in epidemiological interpretation.

<question>A clinical trial is examining the effectiveness of a novel renal-preserving treatment for EPN in diabetic patients. The trial enrolled 120 patients with diabetes mellitus and EPN. After treatment, 65% of the patients showed complete resolution of the EPN without requiring nephrectomy, while the remaining patients required nephrectomy. How many patients in the trial required nephrectomy?</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Met. Realistic clinical trial context.
*   **Guideline 2 (Numerical Answer):** Met.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Not adequately met. This is a very basic two-step arithmetic problem (total - percentage resolved). It does not involve two or more distinct biological principles.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Not met. This is a very common "percentage remaining" calculation, not conceptually unique.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units):** Met, "patients" is appropriate.

**Actionable Feedback:**
This question needs significant improvement to meet the "multi-step biological reasoning" and "uniqueness" criteria.
**Example improvement:**
"A clinical trial enrolled 120 diabetic patients with EPN. After treatment, 65% showed complete resolution without nephrectomy. Among the patients requiring nephrectomy, 40% developed subsequent chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring dialysis within two years. If 15% of the patients who achieved complete resolution without nephrectomy also developed CKD requiring dialysis due to pre-existing conditions, what is the *total* number of patients from the trial who required dialysis within two years?"
This revised question requires calculating two separate groups, applying different rates to each, and then summing them for a total biological outcome. It integrates treatment success, complication rates, and the impact of pre-existing conditions.

<question>A researcher is developing a diagnostic imaging protocol to improve the accuracy of EPN diagnosis. Using a new imaging technique, they correctly identified 92 out of 100 confirmed EPN cases. What is the sensitivity of this new imaging technique, expressed as a percentage?</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Met. Realistic diagnostic context.
*   **Guideline 2 (Numerical Answer):** Met.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Not met. This is a single-step calculation and a direct application of the definition of sensitivity. It does not involve multiple biological principles or complex reasoning steps.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Not met. This is a very standard textbook problem for defining/calculating diagnostic sensitivity.

**Actionable Feedback:**
To achieve "multi-step reasoning" and "uniqueness," transform this into a diagnostic prediction problem.
**Example improvement:**
"A new imaging technique for EPN diagnosis has a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 85%. In a population where the prevalence of EPN is 5%, what is the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of this technique, expressed as a percentage? Calculate the PPV using Bayes' theorem or a 2x2 table method."
This question requires calculating true positives, false positives, and then applying them to the PPV formula, thus involving multiple steps and the understanding of several interdependent diagnostic principles (sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, PPV).

<question>A study is conducted to investigate the relationship between pre-existing comorbidities and EPN severity. Out of 300 EPN patients, 180 had diabetes mellitus. Among those with diabetes, 120 were classified as having severe (Class 3 or 4) EPN. If the proportion of severe EPN cases in diabetic patients is representative of the overall population, how many EPN patients out of the total 300 would be expected to have severe EPN, given the rate in diabetic patients?</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Met. Realistic epidemiological study context.
*   **Guideline 2 (Numerical Answer):** Met.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Partially met. It's arithmetically multi-step (calculate a rate from a subset, then apply it to the total), involving a conceptual step about representativeness. However, it still primarily tests quantitative reasoning rather than integrating diverse biological principles.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Better than previous questions, but the "representativeness" assumption simplifies it.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units):** Met, "patients" is appropriate.

**Actionable Feedback:**
To enhance "multi-step biological reasoning," introduce a differential effect or a follow-up consequence.
**Example improvement:**
"Out of 300 EPN patients, 180 had diabetes mellitus. Among those with diabetes, 120 were classified as having severe EPN. For non-diabetic EPN patients, the incidence of severe EPN is only 20%. If a new treatment is 75% effective at down-staging severe EPN to non-severe status in diabetic patients, but only 50% effective in non-diabetic patients, how many total EPN patients would still be classified as severe after this treatment in the entire cohort of 300?"
This question requires calculating the number of severe cases in both diabetic and non-diabetic groups separately, then applying differential treatment efficacies, and finally summing the remaining severe cases. This integrates comorbidity, severity classification, and differential treatment response based on patient characteristics, involving more complex biological interactions.

Here's a critique of each question against the provided guidelines:

### Question 1

**Critique:**
This question is well-constructed and adheres to all guidelines. It presents a clear biological scenario, requires multi-step calculations, and asks for a single numerical answer. The phrasing is concise and unambiguous.

**Feedback:**
*   **Guideline 1-12:** All guidelines are met effectively. No specific improvements needed for the question itself.

### Question 2

**Critique:**
An excellent question that sets up a comparative scenario, demanding careful multi-step reasoning to determine an 'avoided' outcome. It aligns well with all specified guidelines.

**Feedback:**
*   **Guideline 1-12:** All guidelines are met effectively. No specific improvements needed for the question itself.

### Question 3

**Critique:**
This question is strong, requiring the calculation of outcomes for two distinct patient groups and then summing them. It accurately models a clinical trial scenario and meets all criteria.

**Feedback:**
*   **Guideline 1-12:** All guidelines are met effectively. No specific improvements needed for the question itself.

### Question 4

**Critique:**
This question effectively assesses understanding of diagnostic statistics (PPV, sensitivity, specificity, prevalence), which is crucial in biology/medicine. It explicitly guides the method (Bayes' or 2x2 table) without giving away the answer.

**Feedback:**
*   **Guideline 7 (Use rigorous, concise phrasing):** While good, the explicit instruction "Calculate the PPV using Bayes' theorem or a 2x2 table method" slightly deviates from being purely a 'question' and acts as an instruction. For ultimate conciseness, this could be omitted if the target audience is expected to know how to calculate PPV. However, for a specific assessment purpose, it can also be a helpful clarification. This is a minor point.
*   **Guideline 1-6, 8-12:** All other guidelines are met effectively.

### Question 5

**Critique:**
This is another robust question that requires segmenting a patient cohort and applying different treatment efficacies based on patient characteristics. It models a complex clinical scenario well and demands multi-step reasoning.

**Feedback:**
*   **Guideline 1-12:** All guidelines are met effectively. No specific improvements needed for the question itself.

**Overall Summary:**

These are exceptionally well-designed quantitative biology questions. They consistently meet the criteria of modeling realistic scenarios, forcing multi-step reasoning, having single solutions, and using rigorous phrasing. The format is clear and conducive to structured solutions as per the LaTeX guidelines (though the questions themselves don't inherently require LaTeX for their internal values). They would be effective tools for assessing advanced learners.
