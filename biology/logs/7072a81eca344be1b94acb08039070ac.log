Here are five undergraduate-level biology questions based on your specifications:

<question>A researcher is studying the effects of a novel antibiotic on a bacterial culture. They start with an initial bacterial density of $5 \\times 10^5$ cells/mL. After 4 hours of incubation with the antibiotic, the bacterial density drops to $2 \\times 10^4$ cells/mL.

<question>A researcher is studying the effects of a novel antibiotic on a bacterial culture. They start with an initial bacterial density of $5 \times 10^5$ cells/mL. After 4 hours of incubation with the antibiotic, the bacterial density drops to $2 \times 10^4$ cells/mL. Assuming exponential decay of the bacterial population, what is the decay rate constant ($k$) of the bacteria population in $\mathrm{h^{-1}}$? </question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Achieved. A realistic scenario of antibiotic effect on bacteria.
*   **Guideline 2 (Expect numerical answer):** Achieved. Asks for a single numerical value.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Achieved. Requires recalling the exponential decay formula, substituting values, and solving for $k$.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Achieved. It's a problem to solve.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Needs improvement.** This is a very standard application of the exponential decay formula, commonly found in introductory biology or calculus-based physics/biology problems. It lacks a unique conceptual twist or novel scenario.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Achieved. Yields a single correct numerical answer.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Achieved. Clear and professional.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units must be consistent; symbols follow notation):** Achieved. Units are consistent, and symbols are conventional.
*   **Guideline 10 (Questions must not be multipart):** Achieved. Focuses on a single target quantity.
*   **LaTeX Syntax:** **Needs minor correction.** `\\times` should be `\times` and `\\mathrm{h^{-1}}` should be `\mathrm{h^{-1}}`.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Fix LaTeX:** Change `$5 \\times 10^5$` to `$5 \times 10^5$`, `$2 \\times 10^4$` to `$2 \times 10^4$`, and `$\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$` to `$\mathrm{h^{-1}}$`.
2.  **Enhance Uniqueness:** To make it more unique, consider embedding this calculation within a larger biological context or asking for a less direct consequence. For example, "How much longer would it take for the population to drop to $1 \times 10^3$ cells/mL given the calculated decay rate?" or "If a different antibiotic achieved the same density in 2 hours, what is its relative efficacy ($k_2/k_1$) compared to the first antibiotic?".

<question>A population of insects is found to have two distinct color morphs: red and blue. The allele for red color (R) is dominant over the allele for blue color (r). In a sample of 500 insects, 45 are blue. Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, calculate the number of insects that are heterozygous ($Rr$).</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Achieved. A classic population genetics setup.
*   **Guideline 2 (Expect numerical answer):** Achieved. Asks for a single numerical value.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Achieved. Requires calculating $q^2$, then $q$, then $p$, then $2pq$, and finally multiplying by the total population size.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Achieved. It's a problem to solve.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Needs improvement.** This is a textbook-standard Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium problem. It's almost identical to examples found in any genetics textbook.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Achieved. Yields a single correct numerical answer.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Achieved. Clear and professional.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units must be consistent; symbols follow notation):** Achieved. Symbols and implied units are conventional.
*   **Guideline 10 (Questions must not be multipart):** Achieved. Focuses on a single target quantity.
*   **LaTeX Syntax:** Achieved. No LaTeX issues.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Enhance Uniqueness:** To make it more unique, integrate the Hardy-Weinberg calculation into a more complex scenario. For example, "After a natural disaster, a new sample shows a different frequency of blue insects. Has the population remained in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium? If not, what is the expected number of heterozygotes if it *were* in equilibrium based on the new blue frequency?" or "If the population *also* has a lethal recessive allele linked to color, how would that affect the expected frequencies over generations?".

<question>In a cell culture experiment, researchers are investigating the uptake of glucose by cells. They measure the initial glucose concentration in the medium as $10 \, \mathrm{mM}$. After 2 hours, the glucose concentration decreases to $6 \, \mathrm{mM}$. If the cells consume glucose at a constant rate, what is the per cell glucose consumption rate, given that there are $1 \times 10^6$ cells/mL in the culture? Express your answer in units of $\mathrm{pmol\,cell^{-1}\,h^{-1}}$.</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Achieved. A realistic cell culture experiment scenario.
*   **Guideline 2 (Expect numerical answer):** Achieved. Asks for a single numerical value.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Achieved. Requires calculating the change in concentration, dividing by time for a rate, converting mM to pmol, and then normalizing by cell density and implicitly by volume.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Achieved. It's a problem to solve.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Achieved. While rate calculations are common, combining concentration change, per-cell normalization, and specific unit conversion (`pmol`) makes this problem slightly more unique and integrated than typical textbook examples.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Achieved. Yields a single correct numerical answer, assuming standard interpretation of "cells/mL" implying calculations for a 1mL volume.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Achieved. Clear and professional.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units must be consistent; symbols follow notation):** Achieved. All units and symbols are consistent and conventional.
*   **Guideline 10 (Questions must not be multipart):** Achieved. Focuses on a single target quantity.
*   **LaTeX Syntax:** **Needs minor correction.** `$10 \\,\\mathrm{mM}$` should be `$10 \, \mathrm{mM}$`, `$6 \\,\\mathrm{mM}$` should be `$6 \, \mathrm{mM}$`, `$1 \\times 10^6$` should be `$1 \times 10^6$`, and `$\\mathrm{pmol\\,cell^{-1}\\,h^{-1}}$` should be `$\mathrm{pmol\,cell^{-1}\,h^{-1}}$`.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Fix LaTeX:** Change `\\,` to `\,` and `\\times` to `\times` and `\\` before `\mathrm` to nothing as indicated in the critique.
2.  **Clarify Volume (Optional but Recommended):** While "cells/mL in the culture" strongly implies a 1 mL basis for calculations, explicitly stating "in a 1 mL culture volume" would remove any potential ambiguity for some students.

<question>Two linked genes, A and B, are located on the same chromosome. The recombination frequency between these genes is 8%. An individual with the genotype $Ab/aB$ is testcrossed with an individual with the genotype $ab/ab$. Out of 1000 offspring, how many are expected to have the genotype $ab/ab$? </question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Achieved. A standard genetics scenario involving linked genes and a testcross.
*   **Guideline 2 (Expect numerical answer):** Achieved. Asks for a single numerical value.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Achieved. Requires understanding recombination frequency, identifying parental/recombinant gametes from the heterozygous parent, and then calculating the number of expected offspring.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Achieved. It's a problem to solve.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Needs improvement.** This is a very common and direct application of recombination frequency in a testcross, a staple problem in genetics textbooks. It lacks originality.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Achieved. Yields a single correct numerical answer.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Achieved. Clear and professional.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units must be consistent; symbols follow notation):** Achieved. All symbols are conventional.
*   **Guideline 10 (Questions must not be multipart):** Achieved. Focuses on a single target quantity.
*   **LaTeX Syntax:** Achieved. No LaTeX issues.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Enhance Uniqueness:** To make it more unique, consider a scenario with multiple linked genes, a different type of cross (e.g., dihybrid cross, where parental/recombinant phenotypes are not as straightforward), or asking for a quantity that requires an extra interpretive step (e.g., "What is the probability of a specific phenotype not directly given by the genotype count?").

<question>A plant cell has a water potential ($\Psi_w$) of -0.6 MPa and a solute potential ($\Psi_s$) of -0.8 MPa. It is placed in a solution with a water potential of -0.4 MPa. What is the pressure potential ($\Psi_p$) of the cell at equilibrium, in MPa? </question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Achieved. A relevant scenario in plant physiology.
*   **Guideline 2 (Expect numerical answer):** Achieved. Asks for a single numerical value.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Achieved. Requires understanding that $\Psi_w = \Psi_s + \Psi_p$ and that at equilibrium, the cell's water potential matches the external solution's water potential.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Achieved. It's a problem to solve.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Needs improvement.** While it asks for the pressure potential at equilibrium, which is a common aspect, the underlying biological assumption required for a single solution makes it problematic.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** **Needs significant improvement.** This question has a critical biological ambiguity. When water moves into a cell (as it will here, since $\Psi_w_{cell} < \Psi_w_{solution}$), the cell's volume changes, which *dilutes* its internal solutes, thus *changing* its solute potential ($\Psi_s$). The question provides an initial $\Psi_s$ but doesn't provide enough information (e.g., initial volume, cell elasticity, or an explicit assumption) to calculate the new $\Psi_s$ at equilibrium. Assuming $\Psi_s$ remains constant is a simplification often made in introductory problems but is biologically inaccurate without justification, leading to potential ambiguity for a rigorous student.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** **Needs improvement.** The ambiguity regarding $\Psi_s$ at equilibrium makes the phrasing less rigorous for a problem expecting a single precise answer.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units must be consistent; symbols follow notation):** Achieved. All units and symbols are consistent and conventional.
*   **Guideline 10 (Questions must not be multipart):** Achieved. Focuses on a single target quantity.
*   **LaTeX Syntax:** **Needs minor correction.** `$\\Psi_w$` should be `$\Psi_w$`, `$\\Psi_s$` should be `$\Psi_s$`, `$\\Psi_p$` should be `$\Psi_p$`, and `$\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$` should be `$\, \mathrm{MPa}$`.

**Actionable Feedback:**
1.  **Fix LaTeX:** Change `\\Psi` to `\Psi` and `\\,` to `\,` as indicated in the critique.
2.  **Resolve Ambiguity for $\Psi_s$:**
    *   **Option A (Best for clarity):** Explicitly state an assumption: "Assuming the cell volume does not change significantly at equilibrium (e.g., due to a rigid cell wall), so its solute potential ($\Psi_s$) remains constant..." This validates the common simplified approach.
    *   **Option B (More complex, but realistic):** Provide additional information (e.g., initial cell volume, initial solute concentration, volume of external solution, or wall extensibility) that would allow students to calculate the change in $\Psi_s$ as water enters. This would make it a much harder problem.
    *   **Option C (Simpler question):** Ask for the water potential of the cell at equilibrium, which directly equals the external solution's water potential and avoids the $\Psi_s$ issue.

Here's a critique of the provided biology questions:

**Question 1: Bacterial decay**
`<question>A researcher is studying the effects of a novel antibiotic on a bacterial culture. They start with an initial bacterial density of $5 \times 10^5$ cells/mL. After 4 hours of incubation with the antibiotic, the bacterial density drops to $2 \times 10^4$ cells/mL. Assuming exponential decay of the bacterial population, how much longer would it take for the population to drop to $1 \times 10^3$ cells/mL, given the decay rate constant ($k$) in $\mathrm{h^{-1}}$?</question>`

*   **Critique:** The phrasing "given the decay rate constant ($k$) in $\mathrm{h^{-1}}$" is slightly ambiguous. It implies $k$ is provided, but it must be calculated first from the given data.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Rephrase to clarify that $k$ must be derived from the initial data. For example: "Assuming exponential decay, what is the decay rate constant ($k$) in $\mathrm{h^{-1}}$, and how much longer would it take for the population to drop to $1 \times 10^3$ cells/mL?" or remove "given" if the intent was just to specify the unit for $k$.

**Question 2: Hardy-Weinberg**
`<question>A population of insects is found to have two distinct color morphs: red and blue. The allele for red color (R) is dominant over the allele for blue color (r). In a sample of 500 insects, 45 are blue. A subsequent natural disaster significantly alters the environment. A new sample reveals that the frequency of blue insects has increased to 0.15. Assuming the population *were* in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium after the disaster (based on the new blue frequency), what would be the expected number of heterozygous ($Rr$) insects?</question>`

*   **Critique:** The question asks for the "expected number" of heterozygous insects but does not provide the total size of the "new sample." Without this, only the *frequency* of heterozygotes can be calculated, not the absolute number. The initial sample size (500) is irrelevant if the calculation is based on the "new blue frequency" unless explicitly stated that the new sample is also of the same size.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Specify the total population size of the "new sample" (e.g., "A new sample of 500 insects reveals...") or rephrase the question to ask for the *frequency* of heterozygous insects instead of the number.

**Question 3: Glucose consumption**
`<question>In a cell culture experiment, researchers are investigating the uptake of glucose by cells. They measure the initial glucose concentration in the medium as $10 \, \mathrm{mM}$. After 2 hours, the glucose concentration decreases to $6 \, \mathrm{mM}$. If the cells consume glucose at a constant rate, what is the per cell glucose consumption rate in a 1 mL culture volume, given that there are $1 \times 10^6$ cells/mL in the culture? Express your answer in units of $\mathrm{pmol\,cell^{-1}\,h^{-1}}$.</question>`

*   **Critique:** This question is well-structured and effective. It requires multi-step calculations, including unit conversions, and is clearly phrased.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** No significant feedback; this question meets all guidelines.

**Question 4: Linked genes**
`<question>Two linked genes, A and B, are located on the same chromosome. The recombination frequency between these genes is 8%. An individual with the genotype $Ab/aB$ is testcrossed with an individual with the genotype $ab/ab$. Out of 1000 offspring, what is the expected number of offspring that will display the recessive phenotype for both genes, assuming complete penetrance?</question>`

*   **Critique:** This question is excellent. It effectively assesses understanding of linked genes, recombination, and testcrosses with a non-standard parental configuration (trans). It requires multiple logical steps.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** No significant feedback; this question meets all guidelines.

**Question 5: Water potential**
`<question>A plant cell has a water potential ($\Psi_w$) of -0.6 MPa and a solute potential ($\Psi_s$) of -0.8 MPa. It is placed in a solution with a water potential of -0.4 MPa. Assuming the cell volume does not change significantly at equilibrium (e.g., due to a rigid cell wall), so its solute potential ($\Psi_s$) remains constant, what is the pressure potential ($\Psi_p$) of the cell at equilibrium, in MPa?</question>`

*   **Critique:** This question is very well-formulated. It clearly defines the scenario, provides necessary information, and guides the student towards the correct equilibrium state, while explicitly stating assumptions (constant cell volume/solute potential).
*   **Actionable Feedback:** No significant feedback; this question meets all guidelines.
