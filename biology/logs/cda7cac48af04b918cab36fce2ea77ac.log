Here are five novel undergraduate-level biology questions based on the provided topics and guidelines:

1.  <question>A research team is investigating the role of PAX2 in endometrial cancer progression. They analyze immunohistochemical staining intensity of PAX2 in a series of endometrial tissue samples representing normal endometrium, endometrial hyperplasia, and endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The staining intensity is graded on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = no staining, 3 = strong staining). They observe an average PAX2 staining intensity of 2.8 in normal endometrium, 1.5 in endometrial hyperplasia, and 0.3 in endometrioid adenocarcinoma. If a new patient sample of unknown origin exhibits a PAX2 staining intensity of 0.9, and assuming a linear decrease in PAX2 expression as tissue transitions from hyperplasia to adenocarcinoma, what is the most likely proportional contribution (%) of hyperplasia relative to adenocarcinoma to this sample's staining intensity, considering only these two tissue types?</question>

2.  <question>Researchers are examining PAX2 expression in endometrial biopsies. In a cohort of 100 patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma, they find that 20% exhibit complete loss of PAX2 expression (staining intensity = 0), 50% show weak staining (intensity = 1), 25% show moderate staining (intensity = 2) and 5% show strong staining (intensity = 3). If the researchers define "significant PAX2 loss" as staining intensity ≤ 1, what is the odds ratio of significant PAX2 loss compared to moderate/strong PAX2 expression (intensity > 1) in this cohort?</question>

3.  <question>A pathology lab processes 50 endometrial tissue samples, some suspected of carcinoma. They use immunohistochemistry for PAX2 to aid in diagnosis. Based on past data, the lab knows that normal endometrium has a PAX2 staining intensity of 3, hyperplastic endometrium has a staining intensity of 1.5, and cancerous endometrium has a staining intensity of 0.5. The cost of performing a single PAX2 stain is \$50. To minimize costs, the lab decides to perform the test selectively. They reason that if the average staining intensity across all 50 samples is less than 2, they will re-evaluate their cohort to see if they need to collect more samples. If, after staining all 50 samples, the sum of PAX2 staining intensities is 75, what is the average PAX2 staining intensity for all 50 samples, and should the researchers re-evaluate their cohort ("Yes" or "No")? </question>

4.  <question>A study investigates PAX2 expression in endometrioid adenocarcinoma, categorizing samples as either "PAX2-positive" (staining intensity > 0) or "PAX2-negative" (staining intensity = 0). The researchers find that 75 out of 100 endometrioid adenocarcinoma samples are PAX2-positive. Further analysis reveals that the mean PAX2 staining intensity in the PAX2-positive samples is 1.8. What is the overall average PAX2 staining intensity across all 100 endometrioid adenocarcinoma samples (including both PAX2-positive and PAX2-negative samples)?</question>

5.  <question>Scientists are assessing the effectiveness of a novel drug designed to restore PAX2 expression in endometrial cancer cells in vitro. They culture 1000 endometrial cancer cells, where initially PAX2 expression is absent in all cells. After treatment with the drug, they perform immunohistochemistry for PAX2. The staining intensity is measured quantitatively and is found to vary. They observe 300 cells with staining intensity of 1, 200 cells with staining intensity of 2, and 100 cells with staining intensity of 3, and the remaining cells still have a value of zero. Calculate the average PAX2 staining intensity across all 1000 cells after drug treatment.</question>

Here's a critique of each question against your provided guidelines, followed by concise, actionable feedback:

**Question 1:**
<question>A research team is investigating the role of PAX2 in endometrial cancer progression. They analyze immunohistochemical staining intensity of PAX2 in a series of endometrial tissue samples representing normal endometrium, endometrial hyperplasia, and endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The staining intensity is graded on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = no staining, 3 = strong staining). They observe an average PAX2 staining intensity of 2.8 in normal endometrium, 1.5 in endometrial hyperplasia, and 0.3 in endometrioid adenocarcinoma. If a new patient sample of unknown origin exhibits a PAX2 staining intensity of 0.9, and assuming a linear decrease in PAX2 expression as tissue transitions from hyperplasia to adenocarcinoma, what is the most likely proportional contribution (%) of hyperplasia relative to adenocarcinoma to this sample's staining intensity, considering only these two tissue types?</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. Real-world scenario, clear biological context.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Single Word/Numerical Answer):** Yes, numerical answer.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, requires calculating a position on a linear scale.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Yes, problem-solving.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Yes, novel scenario.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** **Weakness.** The phrasing "proportional contribution (%) of hyperplasia relative to adenocarcinoma" is ambiguous. If the sample is a 50/50 mix, is the answer 50% (percentage of hyperplasia in the mix) or 100% (ratio of 50% contribution to 50% contribution)? This could lead to multiple interpretations.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** Mostly rigorous, but the ambiguity noted above detracts from precision.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units/Notation):** "%" is specified. Staining intensity is a scale, which is appropriate for biology.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Not Multipart):** Yes, single target quantity.

*   **Actionable Feedback:** Rephrase the ambiguous part. For example, "what percentage of the sample's composition (in terms of contribution to intensity) is hyperplasia?" or "what is the percentage composition of hyperplasia within this sample, assuming it is a linear mixture of hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma?"

**Question 2:**
<question>Researchers are examining PAX2 expression in endometrial biopsies. In a cohort of 100 patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma, they find that 20% exhibit complete loss of PAX2 expression (staining intensity = 0), 50% show weak staining (intensity = 1), 25% show moderate staining (intensity = 2) and 5% show strong staining (intensity = 3). If the researchers define "significant PAX2 loss" as staining intensity $\leq$ 1, what is the odds ratio of significant PAX2 loss compared to moderate/strong PAX2 expression (intensity $>$ 1) in this cohort?</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Good. Realistic biological context.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Single Word/Numerical Answer):** Yes, numerical answer.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, requires identifying groups, calculating proportions/odds, and then the ratio.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Yes, problem-solving.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Yes, novel scenario.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes, assuming a specific (though unconventional) interpretation of odds ratio.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** The phrasing is clear, but the *application* of odds ratio is unconventional. An odds ratio typically compares the odds of an event *between two different groups* (e.g., diseased vs. healthy). Asking for the odds ratio of two mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories *within the same cohort* deviates from standard usage in epidemiology/biostatistics. While mathematically calculable as (P(A)/P(B))^2, it might confuse students about the concept's typical biological/medical application.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units/Notation):** No units needed for odds ratio.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Not Multipart):** Yes, single target quantity.

*   **Actionable Feedback:** Reframe the question to use the odds ratio in a more standard context that undergraduates would expect. This typically involves comparing two different groups (e.g., "What is the odds ratio of significant PAX2 loss in this adenocarcinoma cohort compared to a cohort of normal endometrium patients, given their respective expression distributions?"). If the intent is to test the specific calculation derived from these within-cohort categories, consider asking for a different, less confusing statistical measure, or explicitly define how the odds ratio is to be calculated in this specific, unusual scenario.

**Question 3:**
<question>A pathology lab processes 50 endometrial tissue samples, some suspected of carcinoma. They use immunohistochemistry for PAX2 to aid in diagnosis. Based on past data, the lab knows that normal endometrium has a PAX2 staining intensity of 3, hyperplastic endometrium has a staining intensity of 1.5, and cancerous endometrium has a staining intensity of 0.5. The cost of performing a single PAX2 stain is \$50. To minimize costs, the lab decides to perform the test selectively. They reason that if the average staining intensity across all 50 samples is less than 2, they will re-evaluate their cohort to see if they need to collect more samples. If, after staining all 50 samples, the sum of PAX2 staining intensities is 75, what is the average PAX2 staining intensity for all 50 samples, and should the researchers re-evaluate their cohort ("Yes" or "No")?</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Good, sets up a plausible lab scenario.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Single Word/Numerical Answer):** Yes, numerical answer and single word ("Yes"/"No").
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, calculate average, then compare for decision.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Yes, problem-solving.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Yes, novel scenario.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Yes, unambiguous.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** Good phrasing.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units/Notation):** No SI units, but intensity scale is fine. Dollar cost is irrelevant to the question asked.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Not Multipart):** **Weakness.** The question asks for two distinct answers: "what is the average..." AND "should the researchers re-evaluate..." This violates the "single target quantity" rule.
    *   **Additional Point (Biological Relevance of Information):** The specific staining intensities (3, 1.5, 0.5) and the cost (\$50) are provided but are entirely irrelevant to the question asked (calculating an average and making a decision based on a threshold). This makes the biological context feel superficial rather than integrated into the reasoning.

*   **Actionable Feedback:**
    *   **To address multipart:** Restructure to ask for only one output. For example: "If the sum of PAX2 staining intensities for 50 samples is 75, and the lab decides to re-evaluate if the average is less than 2, should the researchers re-evaluate their cohort ('Yes' or 'No')?" (This makes "Yes/No" the single answer).
    *   **To enhance biological integration:** Consider revising the question so that the specific intensity values for normal, hyperplastic, and cancerous tissues are essential for the problem's solution or interpretation (e.g., inferring sample composition, or comparing observed average to an expected average based on typical proportions).

**Question 4:**
<question>A study investigates PAX2 expression in endometrioid adenocarcinoma, categorizing samples as either "PAX2-positive" (staining intensity $>$ 0) or "PAX2-negative" (staining intensity = 0). The researchers find that 75 out of 100 endometrioid adenocarcinoma samples are PAX2-positive. Further analysis reveals that the mean PAX2 staining intensity in the PAX2-positive samples is 1.8. What is the overall average PAX2 staining intensity across all 100 endometrioid adenocarcinoma samples (including both PAX2-positive and PAX2-negative samples)?</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. Clear, relevant biological setup.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Single Word/Numerical Answer):** Yes, numerical answer.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Excellent. Requires identifying counts for each group, understanding "PAX2-negative" implies intensity 0, calculating a sum from partial data, and then an overall average.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** Yes, problem-solving.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Yes, novel and conceptually rich.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Excellent, unambiguous.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, Concise Phrasing):** Excellent, clear and professional.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units/Notation):** "Staining intensity" is a scale, which is fine.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Not Multipart):** Excellent, single target quantity.

*   **Actionable Feedback:** This is an **excellent question** that perfectly meets all stated guidelines. No changes needed.

The staining intensity is measured quantitatively and is found to vary.

    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. Realistic in vitro experiment, clear objective.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Single Word/Numerical Answer):** Yes, numerical answer.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Excellent. Requires calculating weighted sum of intensities, identifying cells with zero intensity, and then calculating overall average.

    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Yes, novel scenario.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Excellent, unambiguous.

Okay, here's the refined list of undergraduate-level biology questions, incorporating the feedback provided. I've focused on addressing the specific weaknesses identified in the original questions.

1.  <question>A research team is investigating the role of PAX2 in endometrial cancer progression. They analyze immunohistochemical staining intensity of PAX2 in a series of endometrial tissue samples.  They observe an average PAX2 staining intensity of 1.5 in endometrial hyperplasia, and 0.3 in endometrioid adenocarcinoma.

2.  <question>Researchers are examining PAX2 expression in endometrial biopsies to investigate its potential diagnostic value.  In a cohort of 100 patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma, they find that the average PAX2 staining intensity is 1.0.  In a separate cohort of 50 patients with normal endometrium, the average PAX2 staining intensity is 2.5. Assuming PAX2 loss is associated with disease, what is the odds ratio of having endometrioid adenocarcinoma given an average PAX2 staining intensity ≤ 1.0 compared to having normal endometrium given an average PAX2 staining intensity > 1.0?</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** **Strong.** Presents a realistic scenario in cancer research and diagnostics.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Expect single word/numerical answer):** **Strong.** Expects a single numerical percentage.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Moderate.** Requires setting up and solving a linear equation, which is a multi-step mathematical process. However, the "biological principle" tested is primarily the interpretation of averages and the application of a mathematical model, rather than a deep biological concept.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** **Strong.** It's a problem to solve, not a definition.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Strong.** The specific scenario appears novel.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** **Strong.** Yields a unique numerical answer.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** **Strong.** Clear and professional phrasing.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units/Notation):** **Strong.** Staining intensity is unitless, and the answer is a percentage, which is appropriate.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):** **Strong.** Focuses on a single target quantity.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** This is a good question for testing quantitative literacy within a biological context. To make the biological reasoning even more central, consider if the 'linear combination' assumption could be derived from a biological insight, or if the calculation leads to a biological interpretation that needs to be stated (though this might violate the "single target quantity" rule if it's an additional step). As is, it's a solid quantitative problem.

**Question 2:**
<question>Researchers are examining PAX2 expression in endometrial biopsies to investigate its potential diagnostic value. In a cohort of 100 patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma, they find that the average PAX2 staining intensity is 1.0. In a separate cohort of 50 patients with normal endometrium, the average PAX2 staining intensity is 2.5. Assuming PAX2 loss is associated with disease, what is the odds ratio of having endometrioid adenocarcinoma given an average PAX2 staining intensity ≤ 1.0 compared to having normal endometrium given an average PAX2 staining intensity > 1.0?</question>

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** **Strong.** Relevant scenario for diagnostic biomarker research.
    *   **Guideline 2 (Expect single word/numerical answer):** **Strong.** Expects a numerical odds ratio.
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Intended, but Flawed.** The question *intends* to require multi-step reasoning for calculating an odds ratio.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How based questions):** **Strong.** It's a problem to solve.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Strong.** Unique scenario for an odds ratio calculation.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** **Weak (Fatal Flaw).** The question *cannot be answered* with the information provided. Calculating an odds ratio requires the *number of individuals (counts)* in each category (e.g., how many of the 100 adenocarcinoma patients had intensity ≤ 1.0, and how many of the 50 normal patients had intensity > 1.0). Providing only the *average* intensity for the entire cohort does not allow for determining these counts.
    *   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** **Weak.** While individually concise, the phrasing combined with the missing data makes it unanswerable.
    *   **Guideline 9 (Units/Notation):** **Strong.** Odds ratio is unitless, which is appropriate.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):** **Strong.** Focuses on a single target quantity.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** This question is fundamentally flawed because the necessary data for calculating an odds ratio (counts of individuals within specified intensity ranges for each disease group) is missing. You need to provide specific counts or proportions for the number of patients in each cohort who exhibit staining intensity ≤ 1.0 and > 1.0. For example: "In the 100 adenocarcinoma patients, 85 had intensity ≤ 1.0. In the 50 normal patients, 5 had intensity ≤ 1.0."

**Summary:**

Questions 3, 4, and 5 are highly effective and meet all criteria well. They provide excellent examples of how to integrate quantitative reasoning into realistic biological scenarios.

Question 1 is good, but its core challenge is more mathematical proportion than complex biological principle.

Question 2 has a critical flaw in its data provision, making it unanswerable. This must be corrected to meet the "Single Solution" guideline.
=== Turn 2: Author refines questions ===
Here is the revised list of biology questions, incorporating the feedback. The fatal flaw in Question 2 has been addressed by providing sufficient data to calculate the odds ratio.

1.  <question>A research team is investigating the role of PAX2 in endometrial cancer progression. They analyze immunohistochemical staining intensity of PAX2 in a series of endometrial tissue samples. They observe an average PAX2 staining intensity of 1.5 in endometrial hyperplasia, and 0.3 in endometrioid adenocarcinoma. A new patient sample of unknown origin exhibits a PAX2 staining intensity of 0.9. Assuming the sample's intensity is a linear combination of hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma, what percentage of the sample's composition, in terms of proportional contribution to the observed staining intensity, is derived from hyperplasia?</question>

2.  <question>Researchers are examining PAX2 expression in endometrial biopsies to investigate its potential diagnostic value. In a cohort of 100 patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma, 80 patients have an average PAX2 staining intensity ≤ 1.0. In a separate cohort of 50 patients with normal endometrium, 10 patients have an average PAX2 staining intensity ≤ 1.0. Assuming PAX2 loss is associated with disease, what is the odds ratio of having endometrioid adenocarcinoma given an average PAX2 staining intensity ≤ 1.0 compared to having normal endometrium given an average PAX2 staining intensity > 1.0?</question>

3.  <question>A pathology lab processes 50 endometrial tissue samples suspected of carcinoma. They use immunohistochemistry for PAX2 to aid in diagnosis. Based on past data, the lab knows that normal endometrium has a PAX2 staining intensity of 3, hyperplastic endometrium has a staining intensity of 1.5, and cancerous endometrium has a staining intensity of 0.5. The lab decides to re-evaluate their cohort if the average staining intensity across all 50 samples is less than 2. If, after staining all 50 samples, the sum of PAX2 staining intensities is 75, should the researchers re-evaluate their cohort ("Yes" or "No")?</question>

4.  <question>A study investigates PAX2 expression in endometrioid adenocarcinoma, categorizing samples as either "PAX2-positive" (staining intensity > 0) or "PAX2-negative" (staining intensity = 0). The researchers find that 75 out of 100 endometrioid adenocarcinoma samples are PAX2-positive. Further analysis reveals that the mean PAX2 staining intensity in the PAX2-positive samples is 1.8. What is the overall average PAX2 staining intensity across all 100 endometrioid adenocarcinoma samples (including both PAX2-positive and PAX2-negative samples)?</question>

5.  <question>Scientists are assessing the effectiveness of a novel drug designed to restore PAX2 expression in endometrial cancer cells in vitro. They culture 1000 endometrial cancer cells, where initially PAX2 expression is absent in all cells. After treatment with the drug, they perform immunohistochemistry for PAX2. The staining intensity is measured quantitatively and is found to vary. They observe 300 cells with staining intensity of 1, 200 cells with staining intensity of 2, and 100 cells with staining intensity of 3, and the remaining cells still have a value of zero. Calculate the average PAX2 staining intensity across all 1000 cells after drug treatment.</question>
