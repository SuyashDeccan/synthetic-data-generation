Here are some novel, undergraduate-level biology questions based on the provided topics and guidelines:

<question>
A pathologist is analyzing endometrial tissue samples using immunohistochemistry to assess PAX2 expression. 100 cells are counted in each sample, and PAX2 staining intensity is graded on a scale of 0 (no staining) to 3 (strong staining). A normal proliferative endometrium sample shows an average PAX2 staining intensity of 2.8 per cell. An endometrial hyperplasia sample from the same patient shows an average PAX2 staining intensity of 1.4 per cell. If a subsequent endometrioid adenocarcinoma sample from the same patient shows a total PAX2 staining intensity score of 5 per 100 cells, what is the average PAX2 staining intensity per cell for the adenocarcinoma sample?
</question>

<question>
In a study examining PAX2 expression in endometrial cancer progression, 50 patients are followed over 5 years. Initial biopsies are taken from normal endometrium, followed by biopsies from any subsequent hyperplastic lesions, and finally from any carcinomas that develop. In normal tissue, an average of 85% of cells stain positive for PAX2. In hyperplastic tissue, this percentage drops to 40%. If 12% of the patients develop carcinoma, and in these carcinomas, only 5% of cells stain positive for PAX2, how many cells out of 50000 total cells examined across all normal endometrial tissue samples stain positive for PAX2?
</question>

<question>
Researchers are investigating the relationship between PAX2 expression and disease stage in endometrioid adenocarcinoma. They use immunohistochemistry to quantify PAX2 staining intensity in tumor samples from 30 patients. PAX2 staining intensity is scored on a scale of 0 to 3, with 0 representing no staining and 3 representing strong staining. The average PAX2 staining intensity score for Stage I tumors is 1.8. If the average PAX2 staining intensity score decreases by 50% from Stage I to Stage III, what is the average PAX2 staining intensity score for Stage III tumors?
</question>

<question>
A research lab is analyzing PAX2 expression in endometrial biopsies using immunohistochemistry. They are using a semi-quantitative scoring system where the percentage of cells staining positive for PAX2 is multiplied by the average staining intensity (0-3). A normal endometrial sample shows 90% of cells staining positive with an average intensity of 2. An endometrial hyperplasia sample shows 50% of cells staining positive with an average intensity of 1. If an endometrial carcinoma sample shows 10% of cells staining positive, and the research team determines the semi-quantitative score must be less than 0.3 to diagnose the sample as a carcinoma, what is the maximum average staining intensity that is possible in this semi-quantitative scoring system?

### Question 1 Critique

<question>
A pathologist is analyzing endometrial tissue samples using immunohistochemistry to assess PAX2 expression. 100 cells are counted in each sample, and PAX2 staining intensity is graded on a scale of 0 (no staining) to 3 (strong staining). A normal proliferative endometrium sample shows an average PAX2 staining intensity of 2.8 per cell. An endometrial hyperplasia sample from the same patient shows an average PAX2 staining intensity of 1.4 per cell. If a subsequent endometrioid adenocarcinoma sample from the same patient shows a total PAX2 staining intensity score of 5 per 100 cells, what is the average PAX2 staining intensity per cell for the adenocarcinoma sample?
</question>

*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** **Meets.** Effectively models a realistic pathology scenario involving immunohistochemistry and disease progression.
*   **2. Expect answers of single word answer, numerical answer:** **Meets.** Seeks a single numerical value.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** **Fails.** The question only requires a single division ($5 / 100 = 0.05$). The information about normal and hyperplastic samples (2.8 and 1.4) serves purely as distractors and does not contribute to the calculation or require conceptual integration.
    *   **Actionable Feedback:** Integrate the prior data points (2.8, 1.4) into the problem. For example, ask for the *magnitude of decrease* in average intensity from normal to carcinoma, or a ratio comparing the carcinoma intensity to the normal/hyperplasia intensities, which would necessitate using more than one given value and performing multiple arithmetic steps.
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** **Meets.** It's a problem to solve, not a definition.
*   **5. Be Unique:** **Partially Meets.** While the scenario is novel, the very simple calculation makes the uniqueness less impactful as a problem-solving task.
*   **6. Single Solution:** **Meets.** Yields a single correct numerical answer ($0.05$).
*   **7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** **Meets.** The language is clear and professional.
*   **8. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional biology notation:** **Meets.** Staining intensity is presented as a dimensionless score, and the requested answer will also be a dimensionless average score per cell. No SI units are applicable here, and consistency is maintained.
*   **9. Questions must not be multipart:** **Meets.** Asks for a single target quantity.
*   **10. Solution Formatting (LaTeX):** **N/A for question.** (This guideline primarily applies to provided solutions, not the question itself).
*   **11. Multi-Step Equations (LaTeX):** **N/A for question.** (This guideline primarily applies to provided solutions, not the question itself).

### Question 2 Critique

<question>

Initial biopsies are taken from normal endometrium, followed by biopsies from any subsequent hyperplastic lesions, and finally from any carcinomas that develop. In normal tissue, an average of 85% of cells stain positive for PAX2. In hyperplastic tissue, this percentage drops to 40%. If 12% of the patients develop carcinoma, and in these carcinomas, only 5% of cells stain positive for PAX2, how many cells out of 50000 total cells examined across all normal endometrial tissue samples stain positive for PAX2?
</question>

*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** **Meets.** Presents a realistic longitudinal study on cancer progression and expression.
*   **2. Expect answers of single word answer, numerical answer:** **Meets.** Seeks a single numerical value.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** **Fails.** The question requires only a single multiplication ($50000 \times 0.85 = 42500$). The vast majority of the information provided (patient numbers, follow-up duration, hyperplastic tissue data, carcinoma development rate, carcinoma cell percentages) are irrelevant distractors. This is a severe failure for "multi-step reasoning."
    *   **Actionable Feedback:** Re-design the question to require the use of multiple data points from the study. For example, ask for a comparison of cell counts across different stages (normal vs. hyperplastic vs. carcinoma), or ask to calculate a weighted average based on patient progression, which would necessitate using multiple percentages and patient numbers.
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** **Meets.** It's a problem to solve.
*   **5. Be Unique:** **Partially Meets.** The setup is unique, but the simplicity of the actual calculation undermines its novelty for an undergraduate level.
*   **6. Single Solution:** **Meets.** Yields a single correct numerical answer ($42500$).
*   **7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** **Meets.** The language is clear and professional.
*   **8. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional biology notation:** **Meets.** The unit "cells" is consistent. No SI units are applicable here.
*   **9. Questions must not be multipart:** **Meets.** Asks for a single target quantity.
*   **10. Solution Formatting (LaTeX):** **N/A for question.**
*   **11. Multi-Step Equations (LaTeX):** **N/A for question.**

PAX2 staining intensity is scored on a scale of 0 to 3, with 0 representing no staining and 3 representing strong staining. The average PAX2 staining intensity score for Stage I tumors is 1.8. If the average PAX2 staining intensity score decreases by 50% from Stage I to Stage III, what is the average PAX2 staining intensity score for Stage III tumors?
</question>

*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** **Meets.** Successfully models a research scenario investigating gene expression changes in disease progression.
*   **2. Expect answers of single word answer, numerical answer:** **Meets.** Seeks a single numerical value.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** **Meets.** Requires two distinct arithmetic steps: first calculating the amount of decrease ($1.8 \times 0.50$), then subtracting that from the initial value ($1.8 - 0.9$).
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** **Meets.** It's a problem to solve.
*   **5. Be Unique:** **Meets.** A plausible and novel scenario for a percentage calculation problem.
*   **6. Single Solution:** **Meets.** Yields a single correct numerical answer ($0.9$).
*   **7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** **Meets.** The language is clear and professional.
*   **8. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional biology notation:** **Meets.** Staining intensity is a dimensionless score, and consistency is maintained. No SI units are applicable here.

### Question 4 Critique

<question>
A research lab is analyzing PAX2 expression in endometrial biopsies using immunohistochemistry. They are using a semi-quantitative scoring system where the percentage of cells staining positive for PAX2 is multiplied by the average staining intensity (0-3). A normal endometrial sample shows 90% of cells staining positive with an average intensity of 2. An endometrial hyperplasia sample shows 50% of cells staining positive with an average intensity of 1. If an endometrial carcinoma sample shows 10% of cells staining positive, and the research team determines the semi-quantitative score must be less than 0.3 to diagnose the sample as a carcinoma, what is the maximum average staining intensity that is possible in this semi-quantitative scoring system?
</question>

*   **1. Model a biology Scenario:** **Meets.** Effectively models a laboratory scoring system for IHC in a diagnostic context.
*   **2. Expect answers of single word answer, numerical answer:** **Fails (due to ambiguity).** While it asks for a numerical answer, the phrasing leads to ambiguity.
*   **3. Force Multi-Step Reasoning:** **Meets.** Requires understanding the scoring system, applying a diagnostic criterion (inequality), and solving for an unknown.
*   **4. Avoid How based questions:** **Meets.** It's a problem to solve.
*   **5. Be Unique:** **Meets.** A novel and practical application of a semi-quantitative scoring method.
*   **6. Single Solution:** **Fails.** The condition "score must be less than 0.3" is a strict inequality. If the percentage of cells staining positive is $0.1$ (10%), then to achieve a score strictly less than $0.3$, the intensity ($I$) must satisfy $0.1 \times I < 0.3$, which means $I < 3$. Since the intensity scale is 0-3, there is no single "maximum" number strictly less than 3 (e.g., is it 2.9, 2.99, 2.999...? If intensities are assumed to be integers from 0-3, then the answer is 2, but this is not specified).
    *   **Actionable Feedback:** To ensure a single numerical answer, rephrase the diagnostic criterion or the question. Examples:
        1.  Change to "score must be less than or equal to 0.3" (answer would be 3).
        2.  Ask for the "maximum *integer* average staining intensity" (answer would be 2).
        3.  Specify the required decimal precision for the answer.
*   **7. Use rigorous, concise phrasing:** **Fails (due to ambiguity).** The phrase "maximum average staining intensity that is possible in this semi-quantitative scoring system" coupled with a strict inequality creates the ambiguity mentioned in point 6.
    *   **Actionable Feedback:** Clarify the exact type of numerical answer expected (e.g., integer, a specific decimal precision, or modify the inequality).
*   **8. Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units. Symbols should follow conventional biology notation:** **Meets.** The scores are dimensionless, and consistency is maintained. No SI units are applicable here.
*   **9. Questions must not be multipart:** **Meets.** Asks for a single target quantity.
*   **10. Solution Formatting (LaTeX):** **N/A for question.**
*   **11. Multi-Step Equations (LaTeX):** **N/A for question.**

=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of the provided questions:

1.  **Question 1:**
    *   **Critique:** This question is well-structured and meets most guidelines. It presents a realistic biological scenario, requires multi-step reasoning (calculate average for adenocarcinoma, then the ratio), and asks for a single numerical answer. The phrasing is clear and concise.
    *   **Suggestions for Improvement:** No specific improvements needed based on the provided guidelines.

2.  **Question 2:**
    *   **Critique:** While the question establishes a biological scenario and requires multi-step reasoning, it contains extraneous information ("50 patients are followed over 5 years. Initial biopsies are taken... If 12% of the patients develop carcinoma...") that is not relevant to the final calculation. This violates Guideline 7 (rigorous, concise phrasing) by introducing unnecessary complexity and potential distraction without adding to the biological problem being solved.
    *   **Suggestions for Improvement:** Remove the irrelevant information about the number of patients, follow-up period, and percentage of patients developing carcinoma. Focus the prompt directly on the comparison between normal and carcinoma tissue cells staining positive.

3.  **Question 3:**
    *   **Critique:** This question is clear, concise, and effectively models a biological scenario. It requires multi-step reasoning (calculating a percentage decrease and then the final value) and asks for a single numerical answer. All guidelines are met.
    *   **Suggestions for Improvement:** No specific improvements needed based on the provided guidelines.

4.  **Question 4:**
    *   **Critique:** This question is strong. It creates a practical biological scoring system, requires understanding and application of a formula, and asks for a specific numerical value under a given constraint. It forces multi-step reasoning and is concisely phrased. The information about normal and hyperplasia samples sets context but is not directly used in the final calculation, which is acceptable as it contributes to the scenario's realism.
    *   **Suggestions for Improvement:** No specific improvements needed based on the provided guidelines.
