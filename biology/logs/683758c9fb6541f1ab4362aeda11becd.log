Here are five undergraduate-level biology questions, adhering to your specified guidelines:

1.  <question>A researcher is evaluating the efficacy of a novel rehabilitation protocol combining rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) and Nordic walking (NW) on gait parameters in Parkinson's disease patients. Baseline arm swing amplitude, measured using Kinovea software, averaged $25^\circ$. After 8 weeks of therapy, the average arm swing amplitude increased to $35^\circ$. Assuming a linear relationship between improved arm swing and reduced fall risk, and given that a $1^\circ$ increase in arm swing reduces fall risk by $0.5\%$, calculate the percentage reduction in fall risk observed in these patients following the rehabilitation protocol.</question>

2.  <question>A patient with Parkinson's Disease performs the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test at baseline and after a 12-week exercise program aimed at improving motor neuron excitability. At baseline, the TUG test took 15 seconds to complete. Post-intervention, the TUG test was completed in 12 seconds. Assuming that the primary improvement is due to increased gait speed and knowing that gait speed ($v$) is inversely proportional to completion time ($t$) in TUG tests ($v = k/t$, where $k$ is a constant), calculate the percentage increase in gait speed achieved by the patient after the exercise program.</question>

3.  <question>A study investigating gait symmetry in Parkinson's disease patients utilizes force plates to measure ground reaction forces during walking. In a control subject, the average peak vertical ground reaction force ($F_z$) during right foot strike is 1.2 times the body weight (BW), while the left foot strike yields an $F_z$ of 1.2 BW. In a PD patient, the right foot strike produces $F_z = 1.0$ BW, and the left foot strike gives $F_z = 1.1$ BW. Calculate the absolute difference in the ratio of left foot strike $F_z$ to right foot strike $F_z$ between the control subject and the PD patient. Express your answer as an absolute value.</question>

4.  <question>Researchers are assessing the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on improving gait stability in Parkinson's disease patients. Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) scores are used to quantify balance and gait. The patient's FGA score at baseline is 18. After DBS implantation and optimization, the patient's FGA score increases to 24. Assuming each point increase in the FGA score corresponds to a proportional reduction in the likelihood of a fall and knowing that a score of 30 represents perfect balance, calculate the percentage improvement in balance, measured by the reduced 'distance' to a perfect FGA score, after DBS therapy relative to the baseline.</question>

5.  <question>A study examines the correlation between motor neuron excitability and spatiotemporal gait parameters in Parkinson's disease patients. Electrophysiological measurements indicate that the motor neuron firing rate during walking increases from an average of 8 Hz to 12 Hz after a specific pharmacological intervention. If stride length is directly proportional to the motor neuron firing rate, and the initial stride length was 1.0 meter, calculate the predicted stride length (in meters) after the pharmacological intervention, assuming all other factors influencing stride length remain constant.</question>

Baseline arm swing amplitude, measured using Kinovea software, averaged $25^\circ$. After 8 weeks of therapy, the average arm swing amplitude increased to $35^\circ$. Assuming a linear relationship between improved arm swing and reduced fall risk, and given that a $1^\circ$ increase in arm swing reduces fall risk by $0.5\%$, calculate the percentage reduction in fall risk observed in these patients following the rehabilitation protocol.</question>
    *   **Critique:** Excellent.
        *   **Guidelines Adherence:** Meets all guidelines effectively. It models a realistic biological scenario, requires multi-step reasoning (calculate change in angle, then apply reduction rate), is unique, has a single numerical solution, uses clear phrasing, and handles units correctly.
        *   **Actionable Feedback:** No improvements needed.

2.  <question>A patient with Parkinson's Disease performs the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test at baseline and after a 12-week exercise program aimed at improving motor neuron excitability. At baseline, the TUG test took 15 seconds to complete. Post-intervention, the TUG test was completed in 12 seconds. Assuming that the primary improvement is due to increased gait speed and knowing that gait speed ($v$) is inversely proportional to completion time ($t$) in TUG tests ($v = k/t$, where $k$ is a constant), calculate the percentage increase in gait speed achieved by the patient after the exercise program.</question>
    *   **Critique:** Excellent.
        *   **Guidelines Adherence:** Fully adheres to all guidelines. It presents a relevant clinical scenario, forces multi-step reasoning by requiring students to apply the concept of inverse proportionality and then calculate a percentage change, is unique, and has a single clear numerical answer.
        *   **Actionable Feedback:** No improvements needed.

3.  <question>A study investigating gait symmetry in Parkinson's disease patients utilizes force plates to measure ground reaction forces during walking. In a control subject, the average peak vertical ground reaction force ($F_z$) during right foot strike is 1.2 times the body weight (BW), while the left foot strike yields an $F_z$ of 1.2 BW. In a PD patient, the right foot strike produces $F_z = 1.0$ BW, and the left foot strike gives $F_z = 1.1$ BW. Calculate the absolute difference in the ratio of left foot strike $F_z$ to right foot strike $F_z$ between the control subject and the PD patient. Express your answer as an absolute value.</question>
    *   **Critique:** Excellent.
        *   **Guidelines Adherence:** This question perfectly meets all criteria. It's a robust application of biomechanical concepts (GRF, gait symmetry) in a PD context, requiring students to calculate ratios for two different subjects and then find the absolute difference, demonstrating multi-step reasoning.
        *   **Actionable Feedback:** No improvements needed.

4.  <question>Researchers are assessing the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on improving gait stability in Parkinson's disease patients. Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) scores are used to quantify balance and gait. The patient's FGA score at baseline is 18. After DBS implantation and optimization, the patient's FGA score increases to 24. Assuming each point increase in the FGA score corresponds to a proportional reduction in the likelihood of a fall and knowing that a score of 30 represents perfect balance, calculate the percentage improvement in balance, measured by the reduced 'distance' to a perfect FGA score, after DBS therapy relative to the baseline.</question>
    *   **Critique:** Good, with minor ambiguity in phrasing.
        *   **Guidelines Adherence:** Generally strong. It models a relevant clinical scenario (DBS, FGA), requires multi-step reasoning (calculate initial 'distance', calculate final 'distance', then calculate percentage reduction of that 'distance'), and has a single intended solution.
        *   **Area for Improvement (Guideline 7 - Rigorous, concise phrasing):** The phrasing "percentage improvement in balance, measured by the reduced 'distance' to a perfect FGA score, after DBS therapy relative to the baseline" could be slightly clearer. While the intended calculation (reduction of the *gap* to perfect score) is derivable, some students might misinterpret "relative to the baseline" as referring to the baseline *score* (e.g., $(24-18)/18$).
        *   **Actionable Feedback:** To enhance clarity, consider rephrasing the request for the final calculation more explicitly, e.g., "Calculate the percentage reduction in the patient's *deficit from a perfect FGA score*, relative to their baseline deficit." or "Calculate the percentage by which the 'distance' to a perfect FGA score was reduced, from baseline to post-DBS."

5.  <question>A study examines the correlation between motor neuron excitability and spatiotemporal gait parameters in Parkinson's disease patients. Electrophysiological measurements indicate that the motor neuron firing rate during walking increases from an average of 8 Hz to 12 Hz after a specific pharmacological intervention. If stride length is directly proportional to the motor neuron firing rate, and the initial stride length was 1.0 meter, calculate the predicted stride length (in meters) after the pharmacological intervention, assuming all other factors influencing stride length remain constant.</question>
    *   **Critique:** Excellent.
        *   **Guidelines Adherence:** Meets all guidelines effectively. It integrates neurophysiology (motor neuron firing rate) with biomechanics (stride length) in a PD context, clearly tests the understanding of direct proportionality, and requires a straightforward multi-step calculation.
        *   **Actionable Feedback:** No improvements needed.

=== Turn 2: Author refines questions ===
Okay, based on the overwhelmingly positive feedback, I'm going to make only very minor, stylistic tweaks to further enhance clarity and precision, mostly in the form of slightly more precise wording. The substance of the questions remains excellent, so these are polishing changes.

1.  <question>A researcher is evaluating the efficacy of a novel rehabilitation protocol combining rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) and Nordic walking (NW) on gait parameters in Parkinson's disease patients. At baseline, arm swing amplitude, measured using Kinovea software, averaged 25°. After 8 weeks of therapy, the average arm swing amplitude increased to 35°. Assuming a linear relationship between improved arm swing and reduced fall risk, and given that each 1° increase in arm swing reduces fall risk by 0.5%, calculate the percentage reduction in fall risk observed in these patients following the rehabilitation protocol.</question>

2.  <question>A patient with Parkinson's Disease performs the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test at baseline and after a 12-week exercise program aimed at improving motor neuron excitability. The baseline TUG test time was 15 seconds. After the intervention, the TUG test time was 12 seconds. Assuming that the primary improvement is due to increased gait speed and knowing that gait speed ($v$) is inversely proportional to completion time ($t$) in TUG tests ($v = k/t$, where $k$ is a constant), calculate the percentage increase in gait speed achieved by the patient after the exercise program.</question>

In a control subject, the average peak vertical ground reaction force ($F_z$) during right foot strike is 1.2 times body weight (BW), and the left foot strike $F_z$ is also 1.2 BW. In a PD patient, the right foot strike produces $F_z = 1.0$ BW, and the left foot strike produces $F_z = 1.1$ BW.
