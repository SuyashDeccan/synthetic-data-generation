Here are some undergraduate-level biology questions following your specifications:

1.  <question>A population of migratory birds relies on a specific wetland ecosystem as a crucial stopover site during their spring migration. This wetland is characterized by a high density of *Typha latifolia* (cattails). Due to increased agricultural runoff containing nitrogen fertilizers, the cattail population has experienced exponential growth, reducing the available open water habitat necessary for the birds to rest and forage. A researcher estimates that the carrying capacity (*K*) of the wetland for the birds is inversely proportional to the biomass of cattails. Initially, with a cattail biomass index of 100 units, the carrying capacity for the bird population was 10,000 individuals. After the runoff event, the cattail biomass index has increased to 400 units. Assuming a logistic growth model for the bird population, and given that the current bird population size (*N*) is 6,000, what is the adjusted value of $(K-N)/K$ after the cattail expansion? Express your answer to two decimal places.</question>

2.  <question>A researcher is studying the metabolic rate of a newly discovered species of deep-sea bacterium. These bacteria obtain energy through chemosynthesis, oxidizing hydrogen sulfide ($H_2S$) released from hydrothermal vents. The researcher isolates a population of these bacteria in a closed system containing a known concentration of $H_2S$. Initially, the concentration of $H_2S$ is $50\, \mu M$. After 24 hours, the concentration of $H_2S$ is measured to be $30\, \mu M$. The volume of the closed system is 1 liter, and the bacterial population size is $1 \times 10^9$ cells. Assuming that the oxidation of one molecule of $H_2S$ yields enough energy to produce 3 ATP molecules and the ATP is produced in $1:1$ ratio from consumed $H_2S$. Calculate the average ATP production rate per bacterial cell in units of attomoles per second (amol/s). Avogadro's number is $6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1}$.</question>

3.  <question>In a study of plant-herbivore interactions, researchers are investigating the effects of a specific secondary metabolite (a volatile organic compound - VOC) produced by *Nicotiana attenuata* (wild tobacco). This VOC attracts a predatory insect that feeds on herbivores attacking the plant. The emission rate of the VOC is dependent on the intensity of herbivore damage, following the function $E(d) = 0.5d^2$, where $E$ is the emission rate in nanograms per hour (ng/h) and $d$ is the damage level (leaf area consumed) in square centimeters ($cm^2$). The predatory insect responds to the VOC with a search efficiency ($s$) of $0.01\, cm^2/ng$ (meaning it searches $0.01\, cm^2$ of leaf area per nanogram of VOC emitted). If a plant experiences $10\, cm^2$ of herbivore damage, what area (in $cm^2$) does the predatory insect effectively search per hour in response to the plant's VOC emission?</question>

4.  <question>A researcher is studying the population dynamics of a rare orchid species in a fragmented forest. The orchid reproduces sexually, and its seeds are dispersed by a specialized fungus that forms mycorrhizal associations with the orchid roots. The seed germination rate is directly proportional to the density of the fungus in the soil. In a particular forest patch, the initial fungal density is measured to be $50$ spores per gram of soil. The germination rate under these conditions is $0.02$ seedlings per seed. Due to habitat degradation, the fungal density declines at a rate of $10\%$ per year. Assuming that the germination rate is directly and linearly proportional to fungal density, what will be the germination rate (seedlings per seed) after $3$ years, rounded to four decimal places? </question>

5.  <question>A researcher is investigating the effect of temperature on the enzyme kinetics of a novel protease isolated from a thermophilic bacterium. The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of a specific peptide bond. At $50^\circ C$, the enzyme exhibits a Michaelis constant ($K_M$) of $2 \times 10^{-6} M$ and a maximum velocity ($V_{max}$) of $5 \times 10^{-7} M/s$. When the temperature is increased to $60^\circ C$, the $K_M$ increases to $4 \times 10^{-6} M$, and the $V_{max}$ increases to $1 \times 10^{-6} M/s$. By what factor has the catalytic efficiency ($V_{max}/K_M$) increased when the temperature is raised from $50^\circ C$ to $60^\circ C$? Express your answer as a dimensionless number to one decimal place. </question>

    *   **Overall Assessment:** Good question, but contains a significant ambiguity in stoichiometry that needs correction.
    *   **Guideline Compliance:**
        *   1. Biology Scenario: **Yes**. Relevant biochemistry/microbiology scenario.
        *   2. Answer Format: **Yes**. Numerical answer with specific units.
        *   3. Multi-Step Reasoning: **Yes**. Requires concentration change, moles of substrate, moles of product, rate per cell, and unit conversion.

The "1:1 ratio" phrase implies 1 H2S molecule consumed directly corresponds to 1 ATP molecule *produced*, which conflicts with "3 ATP molecules." This makes the intended stoichiometry unclear.

    *   **Specific Recommendations for Improvement:**
        *   **Clarify Stoichiometry:** Remove the ambiguous phrase. If the intent is that 1 molecule of $H_2S$ consumed results in 3 ATP molecules being generated, simply state: "Assuming that the oxidation of one molecule of $H_2S$ yields enough energy to produce 3 ATP molecules." The "1:1 ratio" phrase is confusing and should be omitted.

This VOC attracts a predatory insect that feeds on herbivores attacking the plant.

4.  <question>A researcher is studying the population dynamics of a rare orchid species in a fragmented forest. The orchid reproduces sexually, and its seeds are dispersed by a specialized fungus that forms mycorrhizal associations with the orchid roots. The seed germination rate is directly proportional to the density of the fungus in the soil. In a particular forest patch, the initial fungal density is measured to be $50$ spores per gram of soil. The germination rate under these conditions is $0.02$ seedlings per seed. Due to habitat degradation, the fungal density declines at a rate of $10\%$ per year.

    *   **Overall Assessment:** Strong question. Good biological scenario and multi-step calculation. Minor phrasing refinement possible.
    *   **Guideline Compliance:**
        *   1. Biology Scenario: **Yes**. Good ecological scenario involving symbiosis and population factors.
        *   2. Answer Format: **Yes**. Numerical answer.
        *   3. Multi-Step Reasoning: **Yes**. Requires calculating proportionality constant, future fungal density (compound decline), and then the new germination rate.

        *   5. Uniqueness: **Yes**. Specific, novel scenario.
        *   6. Single Solution: **Yes**. Assumes standard compound annual decline.
        *   7. Phrasing: **Good**. "Directly and linearly proportional" is slightly redundant; "directly proportional" suffices as it implies linearity. The "declines at a rate of 10% per year" typically implies compound annual decline, which is standard for undergrad biology, but could theoretically be misinterpreted as simple linear decline of 10% of the initial value each year by some.
        *   8. Units/Notation: **Good**. Units are consistent, and the final answer is a dimensionless ratio as expected. Notation is standard.
        *   9. Not Multipart: **Yes**. Single target quantity.
    *   **Specific Recommendations for Improvement:**
        *   **Conciseness:** Change "directly and linearly proportional" to simply "directly proportional".
        *   **Clarity (Optional):** To completely eliminate any ambiguity, you could add "compounded annually" or "exponentially declines" to "declines at a rate of 10% per year", though the current phrasing is generally accepted for this level.

    *   **Expect answers of single word answer, numerical answer (2):** Yes, expects a numerical answer.
    *   **Force Multi-Step Reasoning (3):** Yes. It requires calculating the new carrying capacity (*K*) based on inverse proportionality, and then substituting this value, along with the given population size (*N*), into the expression $(K-N)/K$. This involves at least two distinct mathematical steps grounded in biological principles.
    *   **Avoid How based questions (4):** Yes, it asks for a calculation, not an explanation.
    *   **Be Unique (5):** Yes, the specific combination of inverse proportionality of *K* to a habitat variable, within a logistic growth context, is unique and non-standard.
    *   **Single Solution (6):** Yes, there is one correct numerical answer.
    *   **Use rigorous, concise phrasing (7):** Yes, the language is precise and professional.

    *   **Questions must not be multipart (10):** Yes, it asks for a single quantity.
    *   **Minor Point:** Biologically, if *N* (6,000) is greater than the newly calculated *K* (2,500), the term $(K-N)/K$ will be negative, which accurately reflects that the population is above carrying capacity and would be expected to decline in a logistic model. This is a valid and insightful biological outcome.

When the temperature is increased to $60^\circ C$, the $K_M$ increases to $4 \times 10^{-6} M$, and the $V_{max}$ increases to $1 \times 10^{-6} M/s$. By what factor has the catalytic efficiency ($V_{max}/K_M$) increased when the temperature is raised from $50^\circ C$ to $60^\circ C$? Express your answer as a dimensionless number to one decimal place.</question>

    **Critique:**
    *   **Model a biology Scenario (1):** Excellent. The scenario is highly relevant to biochemistry and enzymology, with the context of a thermophilic bacterium adding an interesting biological detail.
    *   **Expect answers of single word answer, numerical answer (2):** Yes, expects a numerical answer.
    *   **Force Multi-Step Reasoning (3):** Yes. It requires three clear steps:
        1.  Calculate the initial catalytic efficiency ($V_{max}/K_M$) at $50^\circ C$.
        2.  Calculate the final catalytic efficiency ($V_{max}/K_M$) at $60^\circ C$.
        3.  Calculate the factor of increase by dividing the final efficiency by the initial efficiency.
    *   **Avoid How based questions (4):** Yes, it asks for a calculation.
    *   **Be Unique (5):** While the concept of catalytic efficiency is standard, presenting a comparative problem with specific parameters from a thermophilic organism under different temperature conditions makes it unique and applied.
    *   **Single Solution (6):** Yes, there is one correct numerical answer.
    *   **Use rigorous, concise phrasing (7):** Yes, the language is precise and professional.
    *   **Units must be consistent; all numerical answers must include correct SI units (9):** Yes, units for $K_M$ and $V_{max}$ are consistent, and the request for a dimensionless factor for the final answer is appropriate.
    *   **Questions must not be multipart (10):** Yes, it asks for a single quantity.

Okay, based on the previous critique which identified no areas for improvement, I will return the same list of questions. They were already deemed to be of high quality and aligned with the specified guidelines.

1.  <question>A population of migratory birds relies on a specific wetland ecosystem as a crucial stopover site during their spring migration. This wetland is characterized by a high density of *Typha latifolia* (cattails). Due to increased agricultural runoff containing nitrogen fertilizers, the cattail population has experienced exponential growth, reducing the available open water habitat necessary for the birds to rest and forage. A researcher estimates that the carrying capacity (*K*) of the wetland for the birds is inversely proportional to the biomass of cattails. Initially, with a cattail biomass index of 100 units, the carrying capacity for the bird population was 10,000 individuals. After the runoff event, the cattail biomass index has increased to 400 units. Assuming a logistic growth model for the bird population, and given that the current bird population size (*N*) is 6,000, what is the adjusted value of $(K-N)/K$ after the cattail expansion? Express your answer to two decimal places.</question>

2.  <question>A researcher is studying the metabolic rate of a newly discovered species of deep-sea bacterium. These bacteria obtain energy through chemosynthesis, oxidizing hydrogen sulfide ($H_2S$) released from hydrothermal vents. The researcher isolates a population of these bacteria in a closed system containing a known concentration of $H_2S$. Initially, the concentration of $H_2S$ is $50\, \mu M$. After 24 hours, the concentration of $H_2S$ is measured to be $30\, \mu M$. The volume of the closed system is 1 liter, and the bacterial population size is $1 \times 10^9$ cells. Assuming that the oxidation of one molecule of $H_2S$ yields enough energy to produce 3 ATP molecules, calculate the average ATP production rate per bacterial cell in units of attomoles per second (amol/s). Avogadro's number is $6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1}$.</question>

3.  <question>In a study of plant-herbivore interactions, researchers are investigating the effects of a specific secondary metabolite (a volatile organic compound - VOC) produced by *Nicotiana attenuata* (wild tobacco). This VOC attracts a predatory insect that feeds on herbivores attacking the plant. The emission rate of the VOC is dependent on the intensity of herbivore damage, following the function $E(d) = 0.5d^2$, where $E$ is the emission rate in nanograms per hour (ng/h) and $d$ is the damage level (leaf area consumed) in square centimeters ($cm^2$). The predatory insect responds to the VOC with a search efficiency ($s$) of $0.01\, cm^2/ng$ (meaning it searches $0.01\, cm^2$ of leaf area per nanogram of VOC emitted). If a plant experiences $10\, cm^2$ of herbivore damage, what area (in $cm^2$) does the predatory insect effectively search per hour in response to the plant's VOC emission?</question>

4.  <question>A researcher is studying the population dynamics of a rare orchid species in a fragmented forest. The orchid reproduces sexually, and its seeds are dispersed by a specialized fungus that forms mycorrhizal associations with the orchid roots. The seed germination rate is directly proportional to the density of the fungus in the soil. In a particular forest patch, the initial fungal density is measured to be $50$ spores per gram of soil. The germination rate under these conditions is $0.02$ seedlings per seed. Due to habitat degradation, the fungal density declines at a rate of $10\%$ per year, compounded annually. Assuming that the germination rate is directly proportional to fungal density, what will be the germination rate (seedlings per seed) after $3$ years, rounded to four decimal places?</question>

5.  <question>A researcher is investigating the effect of temperature on the enzyme kinetics of a novel protease isolated from a thermophilic bacterium. The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of a specific peptide bond. At $50^\circ C$, the enzyme exhibits a Michaelis constant ($K_M$) of $2 \times 10^{-6} M$ and a maximum velocity ($V_{max}$) of $5 \times 10^{-7} M/s$. When the temperature is increased to $60^\circ C$, the $K_M$ increases to $4 \times 10^{-6} M$, and the $V_{max}$ increases to $1 \times 10^{-6} M/s$. By what factor has the catalytic efficiency ($V_{max}/K_M$) increased when the temperature is raised from $50^\circ C$ to $60^\circ C$? Express your answer as a dimensionless number to one decimal place.</question>
