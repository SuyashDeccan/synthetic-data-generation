Here are some undergraduate-level biology questions based on the given topics, key concepts, and guidelines:

1.  <question>A physical therapist is using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test to assess a patient with Parkinson's disease. The patient completes the TUG in 15 seconds. It is observed that their arm swing is reduced by 40% compared to a healthy individual, impacting their gait stability. Assuming that a 1% reduction in arm swing correlates to a 0.1-second increase in TUG completion time due to decreased balance, what would the estimated TUG completion time be if the patient had normal arm swing?</question>

2.  <question>During a Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), a patient with gait instability scores 18 out of a possible 30. This score is observed after 4 weeks without intervention. The intervention program involves Nordic walking. After 8 weeks of Nordic walking training, the patient's gait speed increases by 0.2 m/s, and their FGA score improves linearly with gait speed increase at a rate of 5 points per 0.1 m/s. What will the patient's final FGA score be after the intervention?</question>

3.  <question>Kinovea software is used to analyze the gait of a patient with Parkinson’s disease. The software calculates that the patient's stride length is 0.8 meters and their cadence is 90 steps per minute. After intervention, the stride length increases by 25%, while the cadence remains constant. Calculate the percentage increase in the gait speed after intervention.</question>

4.  <question>A research study uses the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) to compare two groups: a control group and a Nordic walking intervention group. The control group’s average FGA score is 22 with a standard deviation of 3. The Nordic walking group shows a 20% increase in FGA score post-intervention. Assuming the control group remains unchanged, what is the average FGA score for the Nordic walking group post-intervention?</question>

5.  <question>A patient with Parkinson's disease exhibits a decreased arm swing during gait. Using Kinovea, it's determined that the range of motion (ROM) of their arm swing is 30 degrees. A healthy individual exhibits an arm swing ROM of 50 degrees. Assuming arm swing ROM directly correlates with trunk rotation and trunk rotation directly affects gait speed, with every 1 degree increase in arm swing ROM leading to a 0.01 m/s increase in gait speed, what is the estimated gait speed deficit (m/s) due to the reduced arm swing compared to a healthy individual?</question>
=== Turn 0: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of each question against the provided guidelines:

**Question 1:**
<question>A physical therapist is using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test to assess a patient with Parkinson's disease. The patient completes the TUG in 15 seconds. It is observed that their arm swing is reduced by 40% compared to a healthy individual, impacting their gait stability. Assuming that a 1% reduction in arm swing correlates to a 0.1-second increase in TUG completion time due to decreased balance, what would the estimated TUG completion time be if the patient had normal arm swing?</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Weak. The reasoning is primarily arithmetic application of a given numerical correlation. It tests quantitative skill more than deep biological conceptual understanding or physical reasoning *about* the biological system beyond accepting the stated correlation.
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Strong. Excellent real-world scenario.
*   **Overall:** Well-structured and clear, but the core challenge is mathematical rather than conceptually biological.

**Actionable Feedback:** To improve biological depth, consider asking a question that requires understanding *why* arm swing impacts gait stability (e.g., related to angular momentum, counter-rotation) or data interpretation to infer a relationship, rather than just applying a given correlation.

---

**Question 2:**
<question>During a Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), a patient with gait instability scores 18 out of a possible 30. This score is observed after 4 weeks without intervention. The intervention program involves Nordic walking. After 8 weeks of Nordic walking training, the patient's gait speed increases by 0.2 m/s, and their FGA score improves linearly with gait speed increase at a rate of 5 points per 0.1 m/s. What will the patient's final FGA score be after the intervention?</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Weak. Similar to Question 1, the reasoning is primarily arithmetic application of a given linear relationship. It does not require students to conceptualize *how* Nordic walking improves gait or *why* gait speed relates to FGA score beyond the provided correlation.
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Strong. Relevant clinical scenario.
*   **Overall:** Clear and concise, but focuses on calculation from a given correlation rather than biological principle derivation or deep interpretation.

**Actionable Feedback:** To enhance biological reasoning, provide data from which the student must *derive* the correlation between gait speed and FGA score, or ask for an interpretation of the score improvement in a biological/clinical context (e.g., assessing functional significance).

---

**Question 3:**
<question>Kinovea software is used to analyze the gait of a patient with Parkinson’s disease. The software calculates that the patient's stride length is 0.8 meters and their cadence is 90 steps per minute. After intervention, the stride length increases by 25%, while the cadence remains constant. Calculate the percentage increase in the gait speed after intervention.</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Strong. This question effectively requires the application of a fundamental biomechanical principle (Gait Speed = Stride Length × Cadence). This goes beyond simple arithmetic application of a given correlation.
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Strong. Excellent use of a relevant biological/clinical scenario.
*   **Overall:** This is a strong question that effectively integrates a core biological principle with quantitative reasoning.

**Actionable Feedback:** None specific; this question aligns well with the guidelines.

---

**Question 4:**
<question>A research study uses the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) to compare two groups: a control group and a Nordic walking intervention group. The control group’s average FGA score is 22 with a standard deviation of 3. The Nordic walking group shows a 20% increase in FGA score post-intervention. Assuming the control group remains unchanged, what is the average FGA score for the Nordic walking group post-intervention?</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Weak. Ambiguous regarding the baseline for the "20% increase." Does it mean 20% of their *own pre-intervention score* (which is not given, making it unsolvable) or 20% of the *control group's average score* (requiring an unstated assumption)? This ambiguity prevents a single correct answer.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Weak. The ambiguity in phrasing violates this guideline.
*   **Other points:** The standard deviation for the control group (3) is extraneous information and serves no purpose in solving the question, which can be distracting.

**Actionable Feedback:** Clarify the baseline for the percentage increase (e.g., "The Nordic walking group started with an average FGA score of 22 and then showed a 20% increase..." or "The Nordic walking group showed an average FGA score increase equivalent to 20% of the control group's average score."). Remove irrelevant information like the standard deviation unless it's intended for a statistical calculation beyond the current scope.

**Question 5:**
<question>A patient with Parkinson's disease exhibits a decreased arm swing during gait. Using Kinovea, it's determined that the range of motion (ROM) of their arm swing is 30 degrees. A healthy individual exhibits an arm swing ROM of 50 degrees. Assuming arm swing ROM directly correlates with trunk rotation and trunk rotation directly affects gait speed, with every 1 degree increase in arm swing ROM leading to a 0.01 m/s increase in gait speed, what is the estimated gait speed deficit (m/s) due to the reduced arm swing compared to a healthy individual?</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Weak. Similar to Questions 1 and 2, the reasoning is primarily arithmetic application of a stated correlation. It doesn't require deeper biological conceptual understanding of the causal chain (arm swing -> trunk rotation -> gait speed), only the numerical relationship provided.
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Strong. Good clinical scenario.
*   **Overall:** Clear and well-posed, but the reasoning component is more quantitative application than deep biological inference.

**Actionable Feedback:** To enhance biological depth, consider asking for interpretation of the significance of the deficit or a scenario where students must infer the correlation from provided data, rather than just applying a given value.
=== Turn 1: Author refines questions ===
Here are the refined biology questions based on the feedback, aiming for increased biological depth and clarity:

1. <question>A physical therapist is using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test to assess a patient with Parkinson's disease. The patient completes the TUG in 15 seconds. It is observed that their arm swing is reduced by 40% compared to a healthy individual. Explain how reduced arm swing contributes to gait instability and increased TUG completion time in individuals with Parkinson's disease, specifically considering the principles of angular momentum and counter-rotation.</question>

2. <question>During a Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), a patient with gait instability scores 18 out of a possible 30. After 8 weeks of Nordic walking training, the patient's gait speed increases from 0.8 m/s to 1.0 m/s. Based on clinical data from similar patients, it is known that an FGA score of 22 corresponds to a gait speed of 0.9 m/s and an FGA score of 27 corresponds to a gait speed of 1.1 m/s. Assuming a linear relationship between gait speed and FGA score within this range, what will the patient's final FGA score be after the intervention? Furthermore, describe two specific physiological changes that likely contribute to the improved gait speed and FGA score following Nordic walking training.</question>

3. <question>Kinovea software is used to analyze the gait of a patient with Parkinson’s disease. The software calculates that the patient's stride length is 0.8 meters and their cadence is 90 steps per minute. After intervention, the stride length increases by 25%, while the cadence remains constant. Calculate the percentage increase in the gait speed after intervention. Explain how this change in gait speed might impact the patient's risk of falls and their overall functional mobility.</question>

4. <question>A research study uses the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) to compare two groups: a control group and a Nordic walking intervention group. The control group’s average FGA score is 22. The Nordic walking group started with an average FGA score of 22 and then showed a 20% increase post-intervention. What is the average FGA score for the Nordic walking group post-intervention? Discuss the ethical considerations of using a control group in this study design, considering the potential benefits of the Nordic walking intervention for all participants.</question>

5. <question>A patient with Parkinson's disease exhibits a decreased arm swing during gait. Using Kinovea, it's determined that the range of motion (ROM) of their arm swing is 30 degrees. A healthy individual exhibits an arm swing ROM of 50 degrees. Explain the biomechanical relationship between arm swing ROM, trunk rotation, and gait speed. Propose two potential therapeutic interventions, besides directly focusing on arm swing, that could indirectly improve arm swing ROM and, consequently, gait speed in this patient. Explain the rationale behind your proposed interventions, considering muscle synergies, neural pathways, and biomechanical principles.</question>

### General Feedback:

The questions demonstrate good real-world scenarios and attempt to incorporate biological depth. However, they consistently violate several key guidelines, primarily by being multipart and requiring open-ended explanations rather than single-word or numerical answers. This is the most significant area for improvement.

---

### Question 1

<question>A physical therapist is using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test to assess a patient with Parkinson's disease. The patient completes the TUG in 15 seconds. It is observed that their arm swing is reduced by 40% compared to a healthy individual. Explain how reduced arm swing contributes to gait instability and increased TUG completion time in individuals with Parkinson's disease, specifically considering the principles of angular momentum and counter-rotation.</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Violations:**
    *   **Guideline 2 (Single word/numerical answer):** Fails. Asks for an explanation.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How-based questions):** Fails. "Explain how..." is a "how" question.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Fails. Explanations can vary.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):** Fails. Asks for an explanation rather than a single target quantity.
*   **Biological Depth:** Good, integrates biomechanical principles (angular momentum, counter-rotation) directly relevant to gait.
*   **Scenario Uniqueness:** Good.

**Actionable Feedback:**
Reframe the question to ask for a single, quantifiable output or specific identifier.
*   **Example Reframing (Numerical):** "If a 40% reduction in arm swing in a patient with Parkinson's disease decreases the peak transverse plane angular momentum of their trunk by 20% compared to healthy individuals, and a 10% reduction in trunk angular momentum typically increases TUG completion time by 0.5 seconds, what is the predicted *increase* in TUG completion time attributed solely to the reduced arm swing?" (Requires defining the relationship numerically).
*   **Example Reframing (Single Word):** "Reduced arm swing in Parkinson's gait primarily diminishes the body's ability to generate counter-rotation in which specific anatomical region, contributing to gait instability?" (Expected Answer: "Trunk" or "Torso").

### Question 2

<question>During a Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), a patient with gait instability scores 18 out of a possible 30. After 8 weeks of Nordic walking training, the patient's gait speed increases from 0.8 m/s to 1.0 m/s. Based on clinical data from similar patients, it is known that an FGA score of 22 corresponds to a gait speed of 0.9 m/s and an FGA score of 27 corresponds to a gait speed of 1.1 m/s. Assuming a linear relationship between gait speed and FGA score within this range, what will the patient's final FGA score be after the intervention? Furthermore, describe two specific physiological changes that likely contribute to the improved gait speed and FGA score following Nordic walking training.</question>

**Critique:**

    *   **Guideline 2 (Single word/numerical answer):** Fails for the second part ("describe two physiological changes").
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How-based questions):** Fails for the second part ("describe...").
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Fails for the second part (multiple valid physiological changes).
    *   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):** Fails. It has two distinct questions separated by "Furthermore."
*   **Biological Depth:** The second part (physiological changes) offers good biological depth.
*   **Scenario Uniqueness:** Good.

**Actionable Feedback:**
Split this into two separate questions. The first part is well-structured for a numerical answer. The second part needs significant rephrasing.
*   **Question 2a (Numerical):** Keep the first part as is: "Assuming a linear relationship between gait speed and FGA score within this range, what will the patient's final FGA score be after the intervention?" (Expected Answer: a number, e.g., 29.5 or 30 (if capped)).
*   **Question 2b (Physiological, reframed):** Rephrase to ask for a single, specific physiological adaptation.
    *   **Example Reframing (Single Word):** "Nordic walking training primarily improves gait speed through enhancing which specific physiological capacity related to muscle performance?" (Expected Answer: "Endurance" or "Strength").
    *   **Example Reframing (Single Word, alternative):** "Beyond direct muscle changes, what primary neural adaptation contributes to improved gait control and speed following consistent motor training like Nordic walking?" (Expected Answer: "Plasticity" or "Efficiency").

*   **Question 3b (Impact, reframed):** Rephrase to ask for a single, specific impact.
    *   **Example Reframing (Single Word):** "Increased gait speed in patients with Parkinson's disease is consistently associated with a reduction in which specific clinical outcome related to falls risk?" (Expected Answer: "Falls frequency" or "Falls incidence").
    *   **Example Reframing (Single Word, alternative):** "Improved gait speed most directly enhances which specific category of daily living activities for patients with mobility impairments?" (Expected Answer: "Ambulation" or "Community participation").

*   **Biological Depth:** The first part is arithmetic. The second part pertains to research ethics, which is an important aspect of biology research but less about core "biological principles or steps" as described in Guideline 3.
*   **Scenario Uniqueness:** Good.

**Actionable Feedback:**
Split into two separate questions. The first part is perfectly aligned. The second part (ethical considerations) is difficult to fit into the single-word/numerical answer format without oversimplifying.

### Question 5

<question>A patient with Parkinson's disease exhibits a decreased arm swing during gait. Using Kinovea, it's determined that the range of motion (ROM) of their arm swing is 30 degrees.

    *   **Guideline 2 (Single word/numerical answer):** Fails. Asks for explanations and proposals.
    *   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How-based questions):** Fails. "Explain how...", "Propose...", "Explain the rationale..." are all "how" questions.
    *   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** Fails. Explanations and interventions can vary.
    *   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):** Fails. Multiple distinct directives.
*   **Biological Depth:** **Excellent**. This question delves deeply into muscle synergies, neural pathways, and biomechanical principles, fulfilling the "biological depth" aim very well.
*   **Scenario Uniqueness:** Good.

**Actionable Feedback:**
This question is rich in biological content but entirely misaligned with the assessment format. It needs to be broken down into *multiple* separate questions, each targeting a single, concise answer.
*   **Question 5a (Biomechanical relationship):** "Arm swing ROM primarily influences gait stability by contributing to counter-rotation in which specific anatomical segment of the body?" (Expected Answer: "Trunk" or "Torso").

(Expected Answer: "Levodopa" or "Dopamine agonists").
*   **Question 5c (Muscle synergy/biomechanical intervention):** "Improving the strength and coordination of which specific *proximal muscle group* (e.g., core, hip, shoulder girdle) would most indirectly contribute to improved arm swing ROM by enhancing trunk stability and rotation during gait?" (Expected Answer: "Core" or "Trunk rotators" or "Pelvic stabilizers").
