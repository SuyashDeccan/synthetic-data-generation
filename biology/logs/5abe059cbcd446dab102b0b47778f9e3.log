Here are some novel undergraduate-level biology questions based on your specifications:

<question>
A researcher is studying a population of flour beetles, *Tribolium castaneum*, undergoing selection for increased body size. The initial average body weight of the population is $2.5 \, \mathrm{mg}$. After one generation of selection using a parent-offspring design, the average body weight of the offspring from the selected parents is $2.8 \, \mathrm{mg}$. The average body weight of the offspring from the unselected control group is $2.6 \, \mathrm{mg}$. Calculate the realized heritability ($h^2$) for body weight in this population.

<question>
In a population of parasitoid wasps, *Nasonia vitripennis*, a single-locus sex determination system is present. Males are typically haploid, developing from unfertilized eggs. However, diploid males can arise due to homozygosity at the sex-determining locus. A researcher collected 1000 wasps from a natural population and genotyped them. They found 980 females, 10 haploid males, and 10 diploid males. Assuming the population is in equilibrium for the sex-determining locus, estimate the frequency of the sex-determining allele ($q$) in this population.

<question>
A colony of honeybees, *Apis mellifera*, is founded by a single queen. The queen is heterozygous for a recessive lethal allele ($l$). Drones are haploid and produced via parthenogenesis, receiving only the queen's alleles. Assuming random mating and no other selective pressures, and that 5% of the eggs laid by the queen are fertilized, what proportion of diploid workers in the second generation will be homozygous for the lethal allele ($ll$)?

<question>
A population of tephritid fruit flies is being bred in captivity. The effective population size ($N_e$) is estimated to be 50 individuals. Over 20 generations, the initial heterozygosity ($H_0$) is observed to decline. After 20 generations, the observed heterozygosity ($H_{20}$) is 0.60. Calculate the initial heterozygosity ($H_0$) of the population, assuming heterozygosity declines according to the standard formula $H_t = H_0(1 - \frac{1}{2N_e})^t$.
</question>

<question>
A researcher is establishing a long-term breeding program for silkworms, *Bombyx mori*. They start with 10 unrelated families, each consisting of 20 individuals (10 males and 10 females). To minimize inbreeding, they decide to use a rotational mating scheme where males from family A mate with females from family B, males from family B mate with females from family C, and so on. What is the approximate inbreeding coefficient ($F$) after three generations, assuming that each family contributes equally to the next generation and that the initial inbreeding coefficient is zero? You may calculate this as $F_t = F_{t-1} + \frac{1}{8N_f}$ Where $N_f$ is the number of families?
