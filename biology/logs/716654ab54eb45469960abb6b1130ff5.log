Here are some undergraduate-level biology questions based on the provided topics, key concepts, and guidelines:

<question>
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are being designed to deliver mRNA therapeutics. During production, the LNPs exhibit a barrel-like internal structure formed by stacked lipid platelets. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) reveals a repeating distance ($d$) between these platelets of $5.0 \times 10^{-9}\,\mathrm{m}$. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measures the total height ($h$) of a single LNP to be $5.0 \times 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{m}$. Assuming the platelets are perfectly stacked and the observed height represents a complete stack, calculate the number of lipid platelets ($n$) within this LNP.

<question>
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are being designed to deliver mRNA therapeutics. During production, the LNPs exhibit a barrel-like internal structure formed by stacked lipid platelets. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) reveals a repeating distance ($d$) between these platelets of $5.0 \times 10^{-9}\,\mathrm{m}$.

Assuming the platelets are perfectly stacked and the observed height represents a complete stack, calculate the number of lipid platelets ($n$) within this LNP.
</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. Uses a relevant biological context (LNPs, mRNA therapeutics) and techniques (SAXS, AFM).
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Weak.** This question is a direct, single-step division ($n = h/d$). It does not require "two or more biological principles or steps" beyond basic arithmetic.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Weak.** While the context is specific, the underlying calculation is a very common type of ratio problem.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Good.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units & Symbols):** Good. Units are consistent, and symbols are conventional.
*   **LaTeX Formatting:** Correctly uses `$...$` for inline math.

**Actionable Feedback for Improvement:**
To meet Guideline 3, integrate another physical or biological principle. For example:
1.  Provide the LNP volume or diameter and ask for the *total volume occupied by the platelets*, requiring a calculation of overall LNP volume first, then linking it to the volume per platelet deduced from $d$ and a platelet area.
2.  Alternatively, given the *mass* of lipid in the LNP and the *mass per platelet*, calculate the number of platelets, which would involve density calculations.

**Example of Improvement:**
"Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) designed for mRNA delivery exhibit a barrel-like internal structure with stacked lipid platelets. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) reveals a repeating distance ($d$) between these platelets of $5.0 \times 10^{-9}\,\mathrm{m}$. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measures the total height ($h$) of a single LNP to be $5.0 \times 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{m}$. Assuming the platelets are perfectly stacked and cylindrical with a radius ($r$) of $2.0 \times 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{m}$, and the density ($\rho$) of the lipid material forming the platelets is $1000\,\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, calculate the total mass ($m$) of lipid present in these stacked platelets within a single LNP." (This would require calculating volume per platelet, then total volume, then total mass. This is multi-step.)

<question>
A novel surfactant is designed to stabilize lipid nanoparticle formation. The thermodynamic parameters governing surfactant micelle formation are given as follows: $\Delta G = -20\,\mathrm{kJ/mol}$ and $\Delta H = -60\,\mathrm{kJ/mol}$. Calculate the entropic contribution ($\Delta S$) to micelle formation in $\mathrm{J/(mol \cdot K)}$ at a temperature of $298\,\mathrm{K}$.
</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Good. Directly relates to LNP stabilization and micelle formation, which are relevant biophysical concepts.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Good. Requires rearrangement of the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation ($\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S$) and unit conversion (kJ to J), fulfilling the multi-step requirement.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Good. While it uses a standard equation, the application to surfactant micelle formation in the context of LNPs makes it specific and non-standard.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Good.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units & Symbols):** Good. Explicitly requests units in $\mathrm{J/(mol \cdot K)}$, requiring a unit conversion step, which is excellent for enforcing precision.
*   **LaTeX Formatting:** Correctly uses `$...$` for inline math.

**Actionable Feedback for Improvement:**
*   This question is well-designed and meets most guidelines effectively. No significant improvements are needed.

Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements of an LNP suspension yield an average hydrodynamic diameter ($D_h$) of $100\,\mathrm{nm}$. Further analysis suggests that the LNPs deviate from a simple core-shell model and exhibit a complex multilayer structure. If the apparent density ($\rho_{app}$) of the LNP is $1050\,\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, calculate the mass ($m$) of a single LNP, assuming a spherical shape, in kilograms.
</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. Uses DLS, LNP characterization, and mentions structural complexity.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Excellent. Requires multiple steps:
    1.  Convert diameter to radius.
    2.  Convert nanometers to meters.
    3.  Calculate the volume of a sphere.
    4.  Calculate mass from volume and density.
    This clearly meets the "two or more biological principles or steps" (though here it's more physics/math steps in a biological context).
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Good. Applies fundamental physics concepts (volume, density, mass) to a specific biological entity (LNP) and characterization technique (DLS).
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Good.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units & Symbols):** Excellent. Requires careful unit conversions ($\mathrm{nm}$ to $\mathrm{m}$ for volume calculation, final answer in $\mathrm{kg}$).
*   **LaTeX Formatting:** Correctly uses `$...$` for inline math.

**Actionable Feedback for Improvement:**
*   This question is very well-designed and meets all guidelines effectively. No significant improvements are needed.

<question>
A population of lipid nanoparticles is synthesized, and their size distribution is analyzed. The distribution is approximately Gaussian, with a mean diameter ($\mu$) of $80\,\mathrm{nm}$ and a standard deviation ($\sigma$) of $10\,\mathrm{nm}$. What percentage ($P$) of the LNPs have diameters between $70\,\mathrm{nm}$ and $90\,\mathrm{nm}$, assuming that 68% of values lie within one standard deviation of the mean for a normal distribution?
</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Good. Relevant to quality control and characterization of biological nanoparticles.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Fails.** The question explicitly provides the key statistical information ("assuming that 68% of values lie within one standard deviation of the mean for a normal distribution"). This turns the question into a direct lookup/application of given data rather than requiring the student to recall or derive statistical properties or perform multiple calculations. It essentially asks: "Given X is true, what is X?".
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Weak.** This is a very standard and basic statistics problem, made even simpler by the provided hint.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Good.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units & Symbols):** Good.
*   **LaTeX Formatting:** Correctly uses `$...$` for inline math.

**Actionable Feedback for Improvement:**
To meet Guideline 3 and 5, remove the explicit hint about the 68% rule. This forces the student to recall this common statistical property for a normal distribution. Alternatively, make the range require more complex statistical reasoning (e.g., beyond 1 standard deviation, or combining two ranges, but this might overcomplicate for a multi-step biology question).

**Example of Improvement:**
"A population of lipid nanoparticles is synthesized, and their size distribution is analyzed. The distribution is approximately Gaussian, with a mean diameter ($\mu$) of $80\,\mathrm{nm}$ and a standard deviation ($\sigma$) of $10\,\mathrm{nm}$. What percentage ($P$) of the LNPs have diameters between $70\,\mathrm{nm}$ and $90\,\mathrm{nm}$?" (Removing the last clause).

AFM imaging of lipid nanoparticles reveals a surface area ($A$) of $2.0 \times 10^{-15}\,\mathrm{m^2}$ for a single LNP. If the lipid molecules forming the surface monolayer have an average cross-sectional area ($a$) of $5.0 \times 10^{-19}\,\mathrm{m^2}$, calculate the number ($N$) of lipid molecules present in the surface monolayer of the LNP.
</question>

**Critique:**
*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Good. Uses AFM, LNPs, and relates to molecular composition.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Weak.** This is a direct, single-step division ($N = A/a$). It does not require "two or more biological principles or steps" beyond basic arithmetic.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Weak.** While the context is specific, the underlying calculation is a very common type of ratio problem.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** Good.
*   **Guideline 9 (Units & Symbols):** Good. Units are consistent, and symbols are conventional.
*   **LaTeX Formatting:** Correctly uses `$...$` for inline math.

**Actionable Feedback for Improvement:**
To meet Guideline 3, require an intermediate calculation for the surface area.

**Example of Improvement:**
"AFM imaging of lipid nanoparticles reveals they are approximately spherical with a diameter ($D$) of $100\,\mathrm{nm}$. If the lipid molecules forming the surface monolayer have an average cross-sectional area ($a$) of $5.0 \times 10^{-19}\,\mathrm{m^2}$, calculate the number ($N$) of lipid molecules present in the surface monolayer of a single LNP." (This would require calculating the surface area of a sphere first, then dividing by the cross-sectional area. This is multi-step.)

### **Question 1 Critique**

```xml
<question>
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) designed for mRNA delivery exhibit a barrel-like internal structure with stacked lipid platelets. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) reveals a repeating distance ($d$) between these platelets of $5.0 \times 10^{-9}\,\mathrm{m}$. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measures the total height ($h$) of a single LNP to be $5.0 \times 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{m}$.

</question>
```

**Critique:** This is an excellent question.
*   **Strengths:** It models a relevant biological scenario (LNPs for mRNA delivery), integrates concepts from different techniques (SAXS, AFM), forces multi-step reasoning (calculate number of platelets, then volume, then mass), avoids "how" questions, is unique in its specific application, has a single correct solution, uses rigorous phrasing, and correctly applies SI units and LaTeX formatting.
*   **Improvements:** No significant improvements needed. It perfectly aligns with the guidelines.

### **Question 2 Critique**

```xml
<question>
A novel surfactant is designed to stabilize lipid nanoparticle formation. The thermodynamic parameters governing surfactant micelle formation are given as follows: $\Delta G = -20\,\mathrm{kJ/mol}$ and $\Delta H = -60\,\mathrm{kJ/mol}$. Calculate the entropic contribution ($\Delta S$) to micelle formation in $\mathrm{J/(mol \cdot K)}$ at a temperature of $298\,\mathrm{K}$.
</question>
```

**Critique:** This question falls short on several guidelines.
*   **Strengths:** It introduces a relevant biological context (surfactants, LNPs), expects a numerical answer, and uses correct units and LaTeX formatting.
*   **Improvements:**
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** This question primarily tests the recall and rearrangement of a single formula ($\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S$). It lacks the conceptual depth of requiring multiple distinct biological or physical principles beyond a basic thermodynamic relationship.
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** Calculating $\Delta S$ from given $\Delta G$ and $\Delta H$ is a very standard textbook problem in chemistry/physical chemistry. It does not feel novel.
    *   **Actionable Feedback:** To improve, integrate this calculation into a broader scenario that requires more steps and biological interpretation. For instance, provide equilibrium constants at different temperatures and ask for $\Delta S$, or link the thermodynamic parameters to the critical micelle concentration (CMC) under specific conditions, requiring a multi-step calculation involving both thermodynamics and solution chemistry.

### **Question 3 Critique**

```xml
<question>
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements of an LNP suspension yield an average hydrodynamic diameter ($D_h$) of $100\,\mathrm{nm}$. Further analysis suggests that the LNPs deviate from a simple core-shell model and exhibit a complex multilayer structure. If the apparent density ($\rho_{app}$) of the LNP is $1050\,\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, calculate the mass ($m$) of a single LNP, assuming a spherical shape, in kilograms.
</question>
```

**Critique:** This is a decent question, but has a minor issue with extraneous information.
*   **Strengths:** It models a relevant biological scenario (DLS, LNPs), expects a numerical answer, forces multi-step reasoning (diameter to radius, volume calculation, then mass calculation), avoids "how" questions, has a single correct solution, uses rigorous phrasing, and correctly applies SI units and LaTeX formatting.
*   **Improvements:**
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique) / Rigor:** The statement "Further analysis suggests that the LNPs deviate from a simple core-shell model and exhibit a complex multilayer structure" is interesting contextual information but is immediately contradicted by the instruction "assuming a spherical shape." This makes the preceding statement a red herring that doesn't contribute to the problem's complexity or uniqueness in its current form.
    *   **Actionable Feedback:** Either remove the distracting information about the "complex multilayer structure" or, ideally, incorporate it into the problem. For example, provide parameters for different layers and ask for the *average* density, or ask for the mass of a specific component within a complex multilayer structure, thereby enhancing the multi-step reasoning and uniqueness.

### **Question 4 Critique**

```xml
<question>
A population of lipid nanoparticles is synthesized, and their size distribution is analyzed. The distribution is approximately Gaussian, with a mean diameter ($\mu$) of $80\,\mathrm{nm}$ and a standard deviation ($\sigma$) of $10\,\mathrm{nm}$. What percentage ($P$) of the LNPs have diameters between $70\,\mathrm{nm}$ and $90\,\mathrm{nm}$?
</question>
```

**Critique:** This question is weak against the guidelines for advanced biology learners.
*   **Strengths:** It models a relevant biological scenario (LNP size distribution), expects a numerical answer (percentage), has a single correct solution, uses rigorous phrasing, and correctly applies SI units and LaTeX formatting.
*   **Improvements:**
    *   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** This question directly tests the recall of the 68-95-99.7 rule (empirical rule) for normal distributions. It requires only one conceptual step (recognizing $\mu \pm \sigma$) and no actual calculation beyond recalling a memorized percentage. It doesn't force "two or more biological principles or steps."
    *   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** This is an extremely common and basic statistics problem found in introductory textbooks. It lacks novelty.
    *   **Actionable Feedback:** To significantly improve, make the question require calculation beyond simple recall. For example, ask for the percentage of LNPs outside one standard deviation (e.g., $P < 65\,\mathrm{nm}$ or $P > 95\,\mathrm{nm}$), or within a range that is not a direct multiple of the standard deviation (e.g., between $75\,\mathrm{nm}$ and $85\,\mathrm{nm}$). This would necessitate calculating Z-scores and using a Z-table or statistical software, thus forcing true multi-step numerical reasoning.

### **Question 5 Critique**

<question>
AFM imaging of lipid nanoparticles reveals they are approximately spherical with a diameter ($D$) of $100\,\mathrm{nm}$. If the lipid molecules forming the surface monolayer have an average cross-sectional area ($a$) of $5.0 \times 10^{-19}\,\mathrm{m^2}$, calculate the number ($N$) of lipid molecules present in the surface monolayer of a single LNP.
</question>
```

**Critique:** This is an excellent question.
*   **Strengths:** It models a relevant biological scenario (AFM, LNP surface), expects a numerical answer, forces multi-step reasoning (diameter to surface area, then number of molecules), avoids "how" questions, is unique in its specific application, has a single correct solution, uses rigorous phrasing, and correctly applies SI units and LaTeX formatting.
*   **Improvements:** No significant improvements needed. It perfectly aligns with the guidelines.

<question>
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are designed for targeted mRNA delivery to cancer cells. The LNPs exhibit a core-shell structure with a hydrophobic core and a PEGylated lipid shell. The hydrophobic core, containing the mRNA, has a radius ($r_c$) of $30\,\mathrm{nm}$ and is composed of a lipid mixture with an average density ($\rho_c$) of $850\,\mathrm{kg/m^3}$. The PEGylated lipid shell has a thickness ($t$) of $5\,\mathrm{nm}$ and a density ($\rho_s$) of $1000\,\mathrm{kg/m^3}$.  If 1% of the total mass of the LNP is mRNA, calculate the mass ($m_{mRNA}$) of mRNA encapsulated within a single LNP in kilograms.
</question>

<question>
A researcher is studying the impact of temperature on surfactant micelle formation during LNP synthesis. At $290\,\mathrm{K}$, the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of a surfactant is $1.5 \times 10^{-6}\,\mathrm{M}$, and at $300\,\mathrm{K}$, the CMC is $1.0 \times 10^{-6}\,\mathrm{M}$. Assuming the change in enthalpy ($\Delta H$) of micellization is constant over this temperature range, estimate the change in entropy ($\Delta S$) of micellization in $\mathrm{J/(mol \cdot K)}$. Note: You may need to use the relationship between CMC and Gibbs Free Energy ($\Delta G = RT\ln(\text{CMC})$) where $R = 8.314\,\mathrm{J/(mol \cdot K)}$.
</question>

<question>
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements of an LNP suspension, initially assumed to be monodisperse, yield an average hydrodynamic diameter ($D_h$) of $90\,\mathrm{nm}$. Upon closer examination using cryo-EM, it's discovered that 15% of the particles are aggregated, forming dimers. Assuming the dimers are perfectly spherical with a diameter equal to the sum of the diameters of the two individual LNPs, and that both monomers and dimers have an apparent density ($\rho_{app}$) of $1050\,\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, calculate the average mass ($m_{avg}$) of a "particle" (either a single LNP or a dimer) in the suspension, in kilograms.  Base your answer on the number-weighted average of the masses of the two particle types.
</question>

<question>
Lipid nanoparticles are synthesized with a target mean diameter of $80\,\mathrm{nm}$.  The size distribution is approximately Gaussian, with a standard deviation of $10\,\mathrm{nm}$.  Using the Z-table (or statistical software), determine the percentage ($P$) of LNPs with diameters smaller than $75\,\mathrm{nm}$.
</question>

<question>
AFM imaging of lipid nanoparticles reveals a non-uniform distribution of a targeting ligand on the LNP surface. The LNPs are approximately spherical with a diameter ($D$) of $100\,\mathrm{nm}$. The targeting ligand occupies a fraction ($f$) of the total surface area. The average cross-sectional area ($a$) of a single lipid molecule (excluding the targeting ligand) is $5.0 \times 10^{-19}\,\mathrm{m^2}$, and the average cross-sectional area of a single targeting ligand molecule ($a_l$) is $7.5 \times 10^{-19}\,\mathrm{m^2}$. If the ratio of lipid molecules to targeting ligand molecules is observed to be 4:1, calculate the fraction ($f$) of the total LNP surface occupied by the targeting ligand.
