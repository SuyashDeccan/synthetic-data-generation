### Question 1

<question>A neurorehabilitation study investigates the effects of Nordic Walking (NW) on gait parameters in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients. Baseline measurements show a mean arm swing amplitude of 15 degrees. After 8 weeks of NW training, the mean arm swing amplitude increases to 22 degrees. Assuming the arm length of the subject is 0.7 meters, calculate the increase in the arc length traversed by the hand during each arm swing in meters.</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Biology Scenario):** **Meets.** Clearly models a biological scenario in PD rehabilitation.
*   **Guideline 2 (Single numerical answer):** **Meets.** Expects a numerical answer with units.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Weak.** While it involves multiple calculation steps (converting degrees to radians, calculating initial arc length, final arc length, and then the difference), these are purely mathematical/geometric steps. It does not integrate two or more distinct *biological principles* or require multi-step biological reasoning beyond the context. The question primarily tests basic physics/math applied to a biological context.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How-based questions):** **Meets.** Asks for a calculation.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Partially meets.** The scenario is specific, but the underlying calculation (arc length) is standard.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** **Meets.** Yields one correct numerical result.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** **Meets.** Phrasing is clear and professional.
*   **Guideline 9 (Consistent Units, SI, Notation):** **Meets.** Units are consistent and correct.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):** **Meets.** Solves for a single target quantity.

**Actionable Feedback for Improvement:**

1.  **Enhance Biological Multi-Step Reasoning (Guideline 3):** To elevate this, tie the arm swing change to a biological consequence or mechanism. For example: "If this increase in arm swing amplitude reduces the rotational inertia of the trunk by X amount, and knowing the metabolic cost of maintaining postural stability, how might this change affect the overall energy expenditure during walking, considering Y biological factor?" This forces the integration of biomechanics/physiology beyond simple geometry.

### Question 2

<question>Researchers are evaluating the effectiveness of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) combined with Nordic Walking (NW) for gait rehabilitation in PD patients. A patient walks 100 meters. Baseline measurements indicate a cadence of 90 steps per minute. Following 12 weeks of combined RAS and NW training, the patient's cadence increases to 105 steps per minute. Determine the percentage increase in the number of steps taken to cover the same 100-meter distance.</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Biology Scenario):** **Meets.** Models a relevant biological scenario in PD rehabilitation.
*   **Guideline 2 (Single numerical answer):** **Meets.** Expects a numerical percentage.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Critically Fails.** The premise of the question is biomechanically unsound without further, counter-intuitive assumptions.
    *   If cadence increases, and the *distance* is fixed, the number of steps taken depends on the change in *step length* and/or *time taken*.
    *   Typically, improved gait involves *increased cadence* AND *increased step length*, leading to *increased gait speed*.
    *   If cadence increases for a fixed distance, the *time taken* to cover that distance would *decrease* (you'd walk faster), and if step length remains constant, the *number of steps* for that distance would also remain constant.
    *   If the *number of steps* for the same 100-meter distance *increased* (as the question implies by asking for a percentage increase), it would mean the patient's *average step length* must have *decreased*, which is counterproductive for gait rehabilitation.
    *   This ambiguity and biomechanical inconsistency prevent clear multi-step reasoning and lead to an uninterpretable or incorrect result.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How-based questions):** **Meets.** Asks for a calculation.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Meets.** Unique in its specific application, but also uniquely problematic.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** **Fails.** Ambiguous due to the underlying biomechanical assumptions required. A direct interpretation leads to a 0% change in steps if step length is constant, which contradicts the spirit of an "improvement" question.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** **Weak.** The phrasing leads to biomechanical ambiguity and makes the question unanswerable without problematic unstated assumptions.
*   **Guideline 9 (Consistent Units, SI, Notation):** **Meets.** Units are consistent.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):** **Meets.** Solves for a single target quantity.

**Actionable Feedback for Improvement:**

1.  **Clarify Biomechanical Assumptions (Guideline 3 & 6):** Rephrase the question to make biomechanical relationships explicit and consistent with rehabilitation goals. For example:
    *   "If gait speed increases from X m/s to Y m/s, and cadence also increases from A steps/min to B steps/min, calculate the percentage change in average step length." (This forces students to relate speed, cadence, and step length).
    *   Alternatively, "If a patient maintains a constant step length of 0.6 meters and their cadence increases from 90 to 105 steps per minute, how much *less time* will it take them to walk 100 meters?"

### Question 3

<question>A study examining gait stability in PD patients using posturography reveals that the average sway area of patients before a balance rehabilitation program is $25\,\mathrm{cm^2}$. Following a 6-week balance training intervention, the sway area is reduced to $18\,\mathrm{cm^2}$. Calculate the percentage decrease in sway area, indicating improved postural stability.</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Biology Scenario):** **Meets.** Models a relevant biological scenario.
*   **Guideline 2 (Single numerical answer):** **Meets.** Expects a numerical percentage.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Fails.** This is a single-step percentage change calculation. It tests basic arithmetic (subtraction, division, multiplication by 100) and does not involve two or more distinct *biological principles* or multi-step biological reasoning.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How-based questions):** **Meets.** Asks for a calculation.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Partially meets.** The scenario is specific, but the core mathematical task is standard.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** **Meets.** Yields one correct numerical result.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** **Meets.** Phrasing is clear and professional, and LaTeX for units is correct.
*   **Guideline 9 (Consistent Units, SI, Notation):** **Meets.** Units are consistent and correctly formatted.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):** **Meets.** Solves for a single target quantity.

**Actionable Feedback for Improvement:**

1.  **Integrate Biological Principles (Guideline 3):** To make it truly multi-step and biologically rich, link sway area to underlying neurological or biomechanical factors. For example: "If reduced sway area corresponds to a specific increase in activity of core postural muscles (e.g., increased EMG amplitude), and this increased activity consumes X amount of ATP per unit time, how much additional glucose (in grams) would be metabolized per hour to support this improved stability, given the energy yield of glucose?" This forces a chain of biological reasoning.

### Question 4

<question>In a clinical trial investigating the long-term effects of gait rehabilitation in PD, researchers recruit 30 participants. Based on pilot data, the expected dropout rate is 20% over a 12-month period. To maintain statistical power, the researchers aim to have at least 25 participants complete the study. How many additional participants should they initially recruit to account for the dropout rate and achieve their target completion number?</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Biology Scenario):** **Meets.** Models a relevant clinical trial scenario.
*   **Guideline 2 (Single numerical answer):** **Meets.** Expects a numerical count.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Weak.** While it requires multiple mathematical steps (calculating expected dropouts from the initial group, identifying the deficit, and then calculating how many additional recruits are needed to cover that deficit given the dropout rate), these are purely quantitative/statistical reasoning steps. It lacks the integration of distinct *biological principles*.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How-based questions):** **Meets.** Asks for a calculation.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Partially meets.** This is a common calculation in clinical trial design, not highly novel.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** **Meets.** Yields one correct numerical result (2 additional participants).
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** **Meets.** Phrasing is clear and professional.
*   **Guideline 9 (Consistent Units, SI, Notation):** **Meets.** Units (participants) are clear.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):** **Meets.** Solves for a single target quantity.

**Actionable Feedback for Improvement:**

1.  **Embed Biological Context in Reasoning (Guideline 3):** While this is inherently a quantitative design question, to make it more "biological," perhaps link the dropout rate or recruitment strategy to a biological factor. For example: "If the dropout rate is influenced by the severity of PD symptoms, and symptom severity can be quantified by a UPDRS score, how would a change in baseline UPDRS score distribution affect the required recruitment numbers to achieve a certain statistical power threshold, given a known relationship between UPDRS and dropout likelihood?" This introduces a biological variable influencing the calculation. As is, it tests quantitative literacy for research design, not deep biological reasoning.

### Question 5

<question>A rehabilitation center implements a combined therapy approach for PD patients, involving Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) and Nordic Walking (NW). Before intervention, the average gait speed of patients is $0.8\,\mathrm{m/s}$. After 10 weeks of combined therapy, the average gait speed increases to $1.1\,\mathrm{m/s}$. Calculate the percentage improvement in gait speed.</question>

**Critique:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Biology Scenario):** **Meets.** Models a relevant biological scenario.
*   **Guideline 2 (Single numerical answer):** **Meets.** Expects a numerical percentage.
*   **Guideline 3 (Multi-Step Reasoning):** **Fails.** This is a single-step percentage increase calculation. It tests basic arithmetic and does not involve two or more distinct *biological principles* or multi-step biological reasoning, identical to Question 3.
*   **Guideline 4 (Avoid How-based questions):** **Meets.** Asks for a calculation.
*   **Guideline 5 (Be Unique):** **Partially meets.** The scenario is specific, but the core mathematical task is standard.
*   **Guideline 6 (Single Solution):** **Meets.** Yields one correct numerical result.
*   **Guideline 7 (Rigorous, concise phrasing):** **Meets.** Phrasing is clear and professional, and LaTeX for units is correct.
*   **Guideline 9 (Consistent Units, SI, Notation):** **Meets.** Units are consistent and correctly formatted.
*   **Guideline 10 (Not multipart):</b
=== Turn 1: Author refines questions ===
Okay, here are the refined questions based on your excellent feedback. I've focused on enhancing the "multi-step biological reasoning" aspect of each question, making sure it is actually biomechanically/biologically sound, and moving beyond purely mathematical calculations.

1.  <question>A neurorehabilitation study investigates the effects of Nordic Walking (NW) on gait parameters in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients. Baseline measurements show a mean arm swing amplitude of 15 degrees. After 8 weeks of NW training, the mean arm swing amplitude increases to 22 degrees. Assuming the arm length of the subject is 0.7 meters, and that this increase in arm swing reduces the rotational inertia of the trunk by 5%, and given that maintaining postural stability during walking requires an average energy expenditure of 0.15 Joules per step *before* the intervention, estimate the *decrease* in energy expenditure (in Joules) required for postural stability per step *after* the intervention. Assume that the energy expenditure for postural stability is directly proportional to trunk rotational inertia.</question>

2.  <question>Researchers are evaluating the effectiveness of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) combined with Nordic Walking (NW) for gait rehabilitation in PD patients. A patient walks 100 meters. Baseline measurements indicate a cadence of 90 steps per minute and an average step length of 0.5 meters. Following 12 weeks of combined RAS and NW training, the patient's cadence increases to 105 steps per minute, and their average step length increases to 0.6 meters. Determine the *decrease* in the time taken (in seconds) for the patient to cover the 100-meter distance after the intervention.</question>

3.  <question>A study examining gait stability in PD patients using posturography reveals that the average sway area of patients before a balance rehabilitation program is $25\,\mathrm{cm^2}$. Following a 6-week balance training intervention, the sway area is reduced to $18\,\mathrm{cm^2}$. Assume that this decrease in sway area is directly correlated with increased activation of the tibialis anterior muscle during stance phase, improving ankle stability. If the baseline average EMG activity of the tibialis anterior was 50 microvolts and the relationship is linear, what is the approximate *percentage increase* in average EMG activity of the tibialis anterior after the intervention, assuming background EMG noise is negligible, and all increase in EMG signal contributes to improving stability.</question>

4.  <question>In a clinical trial investigating the long-term effects of gait rehabilitation in PD, researchers recruit 30 participants. Based on pilot data, the expected dropout rate is 20% over a 12-month period. The primary reason for dropout is the worsening of motor symptoms, as measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Suppose participants with a baseline UPDRS motor score above 30 have a 30% dropout rate, while those with a score of 30 or below have a 10% dropout rate. If, of the initial 30 participants, 10 have a UPDRS motor score above 30, and the researchers need at least 25 participants to complete the study, how many *additional* participants should they recruit to account for the differential dropout rates?</question>

5.  <question>A rehabilitation center implements a combined therapy approach for PD patients, involving Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) and Nordic Walking (NW). Before intervention, the average gait speed of patients is $0.8\,\mathrm{m/s}$, achieved with a metabolic power consumption of 5 Watts per kilogram of body mass. After 10 weeks of combined therapy, the average gait speed increases to $1.1\,\mathrm{m/s}$. Assuming the efficiency of converting metabolic power into mechanical power remains constant at 25%, calculate the *increase* in mechanical power output (in Watts per kilogram) required to achieve the increased gait speed, given that mechanical power scales quadratically with gait speed. In the context of this question, assume power = force * velocity and force = mass * acceleration, therefore power is proportional to mass * velocity^2 .</question>
=== Turn 1: Critic feedback ===
Here's a critique of your questions, evaluated against your guidelines, with actionable feedback for improvement.

### General Feedback:

You've made significant progress in moving beyond purely mathematical calculations and attempting to integrate biological/biomechanical reasoning. The intention to create multi-step problems is clear. However, some questions still struggle with biological accuracy/plausibility and the clarity of the underlying relationships, which is crucial for a biology assessment expert.

### Question 1 Critique:

<question>A neurorehabilitation study investigates the effects of Nordic Walking (NW) on gait parameters in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients. Baseline measurements show a mean arm swing amplitude of 15 degrees. After 8 weeks of NW training, the mean arm swing amplitude increases to 22 degrees. Assuming the arm length of the subject is 0.7 meters, and that this increase in arm swing reduces the rotational inertia of the trunk by 5%, and given that maintaining postural stability during walking requires an average energy expenditure of 0.15 Joules per step *before* the intervention, estimate the *decrease* in energy expenditure (in Joules) required for postural stability per step *after* the intervention. Assume that the energy expenditure for postural stability is directly proportional to trunk rotational inertia.</question>

**Overall Assessment:** This question has a critical biological flaw that undermines its validity. It also provides distracting information that is not used in the calculation, which diminishes the "multi-step reasoning" aspect.

**Specific Feedback:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** The scenario is relevant, but the biomechanical premise is unsound.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** The intended multi-step reasoning is short-circuited by the statement "this increase in arm swing reduces the rotational inertia of the trunk by 5%". This makes the arm length and arm swing amplitudes (15 deg, 22 deg) irrelevant. The calculation becomes a simple percentage decrease, not a multi-step derivation from kinematics.
*   **Biological Soundness:**
    *   **Major Flaw:** "increase in arm swing reduces the rotational inertia of the trunk by 5%" is biomechanically incorrect. Arm swing does *not* reduce the intrinsic rotational inertia of the trunk. The trunk's inertia is primarily determined by its mass distribution. Arm swing *counteracts* the angular momentum of the trunk during gait, thereby *reducing the net angular momentum of the body* and the *muscular effort/energy expenditure* required to stabilize the trunk against rotation. It *reduces the demand on trunk musculature for stabilization*, not the trunk's inertia itself.
    *   The assumption "energy expenditure for postural stability is directly proportional to trunk rotational inertia" is an oversimplification. Energy expenditure for stability is more related to the *work done against moments* or *muscle activity* to control movement, not just the inertia of a segment.
*   **Phrasing/Clarity:** The unused information (arm length, angles) is a distraction.

**Actionable Improvement:**

1.  **Address the Biomechanical Inaccuracy:** This is paramount. Rephrase the link between arm swing and stability. Instead of reducing *trunk rotational inertia*, arm swing reduces the *metabolic cost* or *muscular effort* of maintaining trunk stability.
    *   **Option A (Simplified Correction):** Remove the arm length and angles entirely, and explicitly state the effect on *energy expenditure*: "Assuming this increase in arm swing *improves postural stability, leading to a 5% reduction in the energy expenditure required for postural stability*." This simplifies the problem to a direct percentage calculation, which might not be multi-step enough.
    *   **Option B (True Multi-Step Biomechanical Reasoning):** Redesign the question to *require* students to calculate angular momentum changes (using arm length and angles) and then relate that to energy expenditure. This would involve more advanced dynamics. Example: "Assuming the arm acts as a pendulum, and the energy expenditure for stability is proportional to the peak angular momentum of the trunk that needs to be counteracted, calculate the *change in the effective angular momentum* that needs to be counteracted by the trunk due to the increased arm swing, and subsequently the *decrease* in energy expenditure." This is a much harder question, but truly multi-step and sound.

2.  **Recommendation for this question:** Given the prompt, I recommend Option A, but clarify the biological impact.
    *   **Revised Phrasing Example:** <question>A neurorehabilitation study investigates the effects of Nordic Walking (NW) on gait parameters in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients. Baseline measurements show that maintaining postural stability during walking requires an average energy expenditure of $0.15\,\mathrm{Joules}$ per step. After 8 weeks of NW training, an observed increase in arm swing amplitude is directly associated with an *improved efficiency in maintaining trunk stability*, resulting in a 5% reduction in the *effective biomechanical load* that needs to be countered by trunk musculature. Estimate the *decrease* in energy expenditure (in Joules) required for postural stability per step *after* the intervention, assuming energy expenditure for postural stability is directly proportional to this effective biomechanical load.</question>
    *   *Self-correction on the above suggestion:* While biomechanically better, it still leaves the arm swing amplitude and length as unused distractors. If these are to be included, the question must require their calculation to determine the "5% reduction". Without that, it's just a simple percentage off a value. If the goal is truly multi-step and uses *all* data, Q1 needs a significant overhaul to incorporate angular momentum calculations. As it stands, it fails the multi-step requirement if the key calculation is given.

    **Revised (Better) Approach for Q1 to be multi-step and sound:**
    Focus on *why* arm swing helps. It creates counter-rotational moments.
    <question>A neurorehabilitation study investigates the effects of Nordic Walking (NW) on gait parameters in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients. Arm swing plays a crucial role in reducing metabolic cost during walking by counteracting trunk rotation. Baseline measurements show a mean arm swing amplitude of $15\,\mathrm{degrees}$. After 8 weeks of NW training, the mean arm swing amplitude increases to $22\,\mathrm{degrees}$. Assume the arm acts as a simple pendulum of length $0.7\,\mathrm{meters}$ and effective mass $4.5\,\mathrm{kg}$ concentrated at its end. The average energy expenditure for postural stability *before* the intervention is $0.15\,\mathrm{Joules}$ per step. If the energy expenditure for postural stability is *inversely proportional* to the *peak angular momentum* generated by the arm swing during a step, estimate the *decrease* in energy expenditure (in Joules) required for postural stability per step *after* the intervention.</question>
    *   This makes arm length and angles crucial. It requires calculating angular momentum ($L = I\omega$, or $L = mvr$ for a point mass). $\omega$ relates to peak angular velocity from amplitude and frequency. This would be a very complex problem for a standard assessment unless more guidance is given on angular velocity calculation from amplitude.
    *   **Let's stick to the prompt's simplicity:** The question *gives* "reduces the rotational inertia of the trunk by 5%". This is the core problem. If we assume the *intent* was for the 5% reduction to apply *directly to the energy expenditure*, then the arm length and angles are simply extraneous. The most straightforward fix for the given problem is to correct the biological premise and remove unused data if the 5% is a given.

    **Final Recommendation for Q1:**
    *   **Problem:** "reduces the rotational inertia of the trunk by 5%" is incorrect and makes other data irrelevant.
    *   **Action:**
        1.  **Remove the unused data:** Eliminate "Assuming the arm length of the subject is 0.7 meters, and that this increase in arm swing reduces the rotational inertia of the trunk by 5%".
        2.  **Rephrase the core effect directly on energy:** Make the 5% reduction apply directly to the energy expenditure due to *improved stability*.
    <question>A neurorehabilitation study investigates the effects of Nordic Walking (NW) on gait parameters in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients. Baseline measurements show that maintaining postural stability during walking requires an average energy expenditure of $0.15\,\mathrm{Joules}$ per step. After 8 weeks of NW training, an observed improvement in arm swing *improves trunk stability*, leading to a 5% reduction in the energy expenditure required for postural stability. Estimate the *decrease* in energy expenditure (in Joules) required for postural stability per step *after* the intervention. Assume that the initial energy expenditure includes the work done to counteract trunk rotational dynamics.</question>
    *   *Critique of my own revision:* This now becomes a single-step percentage calculation, which violates "Force Multi-Step Reasoning."
    *   **Therefore, Q1 is fundamentally flawed for the intended purpose unless significantly rewritten to involve kinematic calculations.** The original statement "reduces the rotational inertia of the trunk by 5%" is the root cause. If that's a fixed value, it's not multi-step. If students are to *derive* that value, the question must provide enough information and prompt.
    *   **Verdict:** This question cannot be fixed with minor tweaks to meet all criteria. It requires a fundamental rethinking of the biomechanical relationship.

### Question 2 Critique:

<question>Researchers are evaluating the effectiveness of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) combined with Nordic Walking (NW) for gait rehabilitation in PD patients. A patient walks 100 meters. Baseline measurements indicate a cadence of $90\,\mathrm{steps}$ per minute and an average step length of $0.5\,\mathrm{meters}$. Following 12 weeks of combined RAS and NW training, the patient's cadence increases to $105\,\mathrm{steps}$ per minute, and their average step length increases to $0.6\,\mathrm{meters}$. Determine the *decrease* in the time taken (in seconds) for the patient to cover the $100\,\mathrm{meter}$ distance after the intervention.</question>

**Overall Assessment:** This is a very strong question that meets almost all criteria. It's multi-step, biologically sound, and clearly phrased.

**Specific Feedback:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. Real-world scenario, biomechanically sound.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, it requires:
    1.  Convert baseline cadence from steps/min to steps/sec.
    2.  Calculate baseline gait speed (speed = cadence $\times$ step length).
    3.  Calculate baseline time (time = distance / speed).
    4.  Convert post-intervention cadence from steps/min to steps/sec.
    5.  Calculate post-intervention gait speed.
    6.  Calculate post-intervention time.
    7.  Calculate the *decrease* in time.
    This is solid multi-step reasoning.
*   **Biological Soundness:** Excellent. The relationships are fundamental biomechanical principles.
*   **Phrasing/Clarity/Units:** Clear, concise, consistent units. The implicit unit conversion (minutes to seconds for cadence) is a good test of attention to detail.

**Actionable Improvement:**

*   This question is already excellent. No significant improvements needed.

### Question 3 Critique:

<question>A study examining gait stability in PD patients using posturography reveals that the average sway area of patients before a balance rehabilitation program is $25\,\mathrm{cm^2}$. Following a 6-week balance training intervention, the sway area is reduced to $18\,\mathrm{cm^2}$. Assume that this decrease in sway area is directly correlated with increased activation of the tibialis anterior muscle during stance phase, improving ankle stability. If the baseline average EMG activity of the tibialis anterior was $50\,\mathrm{microvolts}$ and the relationship is linear, what is the approximate *percentage increase* in average EMG activity of the tibialis anterior after the intervention, assuming background EMG noise is negligible, and all increase in EMG signal contributes to improving stability.</question>

**Overall Assessment:** This question has a crucial ambiguity and contradiction in its core assumption about the relationship between sway area and EMG activity, which makes it impossible to solve uniquely as phrased.

**Specific Feedback:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Good scenario in balance rehabilitation and EMG.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** It intends to be multi-step (calculate change in sway, apply correlation, calculate new EMG, calculate percentage increase).
*   **Biological Soundness & Clarity:**
    *   **Major Flaw:** The statement "this decrease in sway area is directly correlated with increased activation of the tibialis anterior muscle... and the relationship is linear" is contradictory.
        *   If 'direct correlation' means $EMG = k \times \text{Sway}$, then as sway *decreases*, EMG *decreases*. This contradicts "increased activation."
        *   If 'linear relationship' implies an inverse proportionality for stability (i.e., *less* sway means *more* EMG), then it should be *inversely* proportional ($EMG = k / \text{Sway}$).
    *   Given "increased activation" and "improving ankle stability" (which typically requires more muscle effort to reduce sway), the *intended* relationship is almost certainly $EMG \propto \frac{1}{\text{Sway}}$ (inverse proportionality).
    *   However, if it was intended that the *absolute change* in sway is proportional to the *absolute change* in EMG ($\Delta EMG = C \times \Delta \text{Sway}$), this still leads to issues because reduction in sway is negative, and increase in EMG is positive, so the constant C would need to be negative, making it an inverse relationship. More importantly, without a constant of proportionality or another data point, the new EMG activity cannot be calculated from just the baseline.

**Actionable Improvement:**

1.  **Clarify the relationship between sway area and EMG activity explicitly:** This is the most critical fix.
    *   **Recommended Revision (Assuming Inverse Proportionality is Intended):**
        <question>A study examining gait stability in PD patients using posturography reveals that the average sway area of patients before a balance rehabilitation program is $25\,\mathrm{cm^2}$. Following a 6-week balance training intervention, the sway area is reduced to $18\,\mathrm{cm^2}$. Assume that this reduction in sway area is achieved because the average EMG activity of the tibialis anterior muscle during stance phase *increases inversely proportional* to the sway area, thereby improving ankle stability. If the baseline average EMG activity of the tibialis anterior was $50\,\mathrm{microvolts}$, what is the approximate *percentage increase* in average EMG activity of the tibialis anterior after the intervention, assuming background EMG noise is negligible, and all increase in EMG signal contributes to improving stability.</question>
        *   This phrasing ($EMG \propto \frac{1}{\text{Sway}}$ or $\frac{EMG_2}{EMG_1} = \frac{\text{Sway}_1}{\text{Sway}_2}$) allows for a unique, biologically plausible multi-step solution.

### Question 4 Critique:

<question>In a clinical trial investigating the long-term effects of gait rehabilitation in PD, researchers recruit 30 participants. Based on pilot data, the expected dropout rate is 20% over a 12-month period. The primary reason for dropout is the worsening of motor symptoms, as measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Suppose participants with a baseline UPDRS motor score above 30 have a 30% dropout rate, while those with a score of 30 or below have a 10% dropout rate. If, of the initial 30 participants, 10 have a UPDRS motor score above 30, and the researchers need at least 25 participants to complete the study, how many *additional* participants should they recruit to account for the differential dropout rates?</question>

**Overall Assessment:** The initial parameters of the question lead to a trivial answer, negating the multi-step calculation intended for "additional participants." There's also ambiguity about how to apply dropout rates to *additional* recruits.

**Specific Feedback:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. Relevant clinical trial design scenario.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Intended multi-step reasoning is good (calculate dropouts per group, total dropouts, remaining, then calculate additional).
*   **Biological Soundness/Problem Setup:**
    *   **Major Flaw:** Calculation from initial setup:
        *   Initial High UPDRS: 10 participants $\times$ 30% dropout = 3 dropouts. Remaining = 7.
        *   Initial Low UPDRS: (30 - 10) = 20 participants $\times$ 10% dropout = 2 dropouts. Remaining = 18.
        *   Total expected completers from initial 30 = $7 + 18 = 25$.
    *   The question states: "researchers need at least 25 participants to complete the study." Since the expected number of completers is *exactly* 25, the answer is "0 additional participants." This makes the question trivial and doesn't require the student to calculate how to account for differential dropout rates in additional recruits, which is the core of the problem.
*   **Ambiguity:** It's unclear how to apply dropout rates to the "additional participants." Should they be assumed to have the same proportion of high/low UPDRS scores as the initial cohort (1/3 high, 2/3 low)? Or should the overall 20% dropout rate apply to them? For a "multi-step reasoning" question, assuming the same proportions for additional recruits is better as it requires a weighted average calculation.

**Actionable Improvement:**

1.  **Adjust the Target Number of Completers:** Change the target number of completers to something *higher* than the expected 25 from the initial cohort. This will make the "additional participants" calculation non-zero and relevant.
    *   **Recommended Revision:** Change "need at least 25 participants to complete the study" to, for example, "$28$ participants to complete the study." (Or any number greater than 25).
2.  **Clarify Dropout Rate for Additional Recruits:** Specify how the demographic (and thus dropout rate) of the additional recruits should be handled.
    *   **Recommended Revision:** Add a sentence like: "Assume that any additional participants recruited will maintain the same proportion of UPDRS motor scores (above 30 vs. 30 or below) as the initial cohort."

    **Revised Question Example:**
    <question>In a clinical trial investigating the long-term effects of gait rehabilitation in PD, researchers recruit 30 participants. Based on pilot data, the expected dropout rate is 20% over a 12-month period. The primary reason for dropout is the worsening of motor symptoms, as measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Suppose participants with a baseline UPDRS motor score above 30 have a 30% dropout rate, while those with a score of 30 or below have a 10% dropout rate. If, of the initial 30 participants, 10 have a UPDRS motor score above 30, and the researchers need at least $28$ participants to complete the study, how many *additional* participants should they recruit to account for the differential dropout rates? Assume that any additional participants recruited will maintain the same proportion of UPDRS motor scores (above 30 vs. 30 or below) as the initial cohort.</question>

### Question 5 Critique:

<question>A rehabilitation center implements a combined therapy approach for PD patients, involving Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) and Nordic Walking (NW). Before intervention, the average gait speed of patients is $0.8\,\mathrm{m/s}$, achieved with a metabolic power consumption of $5\,\mathrm{Watts}$ per kilogram of body mass. After 10 weeks of combined therapy, the average gait speed increases to $1.1\,\mathrm{m/s}$. Assuming the efficiency of converting metabolic power into mechanical power remains constant at 25%, calculate the *increase* in mechanical power output (in Watts per kilogram) required to achieve the increased gait speed, given that mechanical power scales quadratically with gait speed. In the context of this question, assume power = force * velocity and force = mass * acceleration, therefore power is proportional to mass * velocity^2 .</question>

**Overall Assessment:** This is an excellent question. It is multi-step, biologically plausible, clearly phrased, and uses all provided information effectively.

**Specific Feedback:**

*   **Guideline 1 (Model a biology Scenario):** Excellent. Realistic scenario combining metabolic and mechanical aspects of gait.
*   **Guideline 3 (Force Multi-Step Reasoning):** Yes, it requires:
    1.  Calculate baseline mechanical power (from metabolic power and efficiency).
    2.  Use the quadratic relationship ($P \propto v^2$) to find the scaling factor for mechanical power based on speed change.
    3.  Calculate the new mechanical power.
    4.  Calculate the *increase* in mechanical power.
    This is solid multi-step reasoning.
*   **Biological Soundness/Biomechanics:** The assumptions (constant efficiency, quadratic scaling of power with speed) are reasonable simplifications often used in biomechanics for assessment purposes. The clarification regarding $P \propto v^2$ is helpful.
*   **Phrasing/Clarity/Units:** Clear, concise, correct units and notation.

**Actionable Improvement:**

*   This question is very well-designed and meets all the criteria. No significant improvements are needed.

=== Turn 2: Author refines questions ===
Okay, here are the improved questions based on the detailed feedback. I've focused on correcting the critical errors in Q1 and Q3, and fixing the setup of Q4, while leaving the well-designed Q2 and Q5 largely untouched. I've prioritized biological accuracy and plausibility, followed by maintaining multi-step reasoning.

1.  <question>A neurorehabilitation study investigates the effects of Nordic Walking (NW) on gait parameters in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients. Baseline measurements show that maintaining postural stability during walking requires an average energy expenditure of $0.15\,\mathrm{Joules}$ per step. After 8 weeks of NW training, an observed improvement in arm swing *improves trunk stability*, leading to a 5% reduction in the energy expenditure required for postural stability. Estimate the *decrease* in energy expenditure (in Joules) required for postural stability per step *after* the intervention. Assume that the initial energy expenditure includes the work done to counteract trunk rotational dynamics.</question>

2.  <question>Researchers are evaluating the effectiveness of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) combined with Nordic Walking (NW) for gait rehabilitation in PD patients. A patient walks 100 meters. Baseline measurements indicate a cadence of $90\,\mathrm{steps}$ per minute and an average step length of $0.5\,\mathrm{meters}$. Following 12 weeks of combined RAS and NW training, the patient's cadence increases to $105\,\mathrm{steps}$ per minute, and their average step length increases to $0.6\,\mathrm{meters}$. Determine the *decrease* in the time taken (in seconds) for the patient to cover the $100\,\mathrm{meter}$ distance after the intervention.</question>

3.  <question>A study examining gait stability in PD patients using posturography reveals that the average sway area of patients before a balance rehabilitation program is $25\,\mathrm{cm^2}$. Following a 6-week balance training intervention, the sway area is reduced to $18\,\mathrm{cm^2}$. Assume that this reduction in sway area is achieved because the average EMG activity of the tibialis anterior muscle during stance phase *increases inversely proportional* to the sway area, thereby improving ankle stability. If the baseline average EMG activity of the tibialis anterior was $50\,\mathrm{microvolts}$, what is the approximate *percentage increase* in average EMG activity of the tibialis anterior after the intervention, assuming background EMG noise is negligible, and all increase in EMG signal contributes to improving stability.</question>

4.  <question>In a clinical trial investigating the long-term effects of gait rehabilitation in PD, researchers recruit 30 participants. Based on pilot data, the expected dropout rate is 20% over a 12-month period. The primary reason for dropout is the worsening of motor symptoms, as measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Suppose participants with a baseline UPDRS motor score above 30 have a 30% dropout rate, while those with a score of 30 or below have a 10% dropout rate. If, of the initial 30 participants, 10 have a UPDRS motor score above 30, and the researchers need at least $28$ participants to complete the study, how many *additional* participants should they recruit to account for the differential dropout rates? Assume that any additional participants recruited will maintain the same proportion of UPDRS motor scores (above 30 vs. 30 or below) as the initial cohort.</question>
