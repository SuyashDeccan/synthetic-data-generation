BIO_06062025_1;A patient undergoing closed reduction of a mandibular fracture experiences significant discomfort. Their initial VAS score is 7. After local anesthesia (lidocaine), the score drops to 3.  Lidocaine's mechanism involves blocking sodium channels, thereby preventing nerve depolarization. Assume a linear relationship between the *rate of action potential firing* and the VAS score.  If lidocaine reduces the rate of action potential firing by the same percentage as it reduces the VAS score, and the resting membrane potential is -70 mV, calculate the *new* membrane potential required to initiate an action potential after lidocaine administration, given that the threshold potential *before* lidocaine was -55mV. (Assume a direct, proportional effect on the *difference* between resting and threshold potential).
BIO_06062025_2;A clinical trial compares two methods for managing mandibular fractures: Method A (standard) and Method B (novel). Method A has a documented success rate of 85%. Method B is hypothesized to have a higher success rate.  The trial aims for 80% power to detect a clinically significant difference of 10% (absolute) in success rates between the two methods (alpha = 0.05, two-sided).  Using a one-sided Z-test approximation for sample size calculation, where $n = 2 * [(z_{\\alpha} + z_{\\beta})^2 * p(1-p)] / d^2$, and *assuming* p is the *lower* success rate (0.85) and d is the difference (0.1), what is the *approximate minimum* number of patients needed *per group* for this trial?  (z-score for alpha=0.05 one-sided = 1.645, z-score for power 80% = 0.84)
BIO_06062025_3;A patient with a displaced mandibular fracture is being considered for ORIF. Pre-operative radiographs reveal a fracture gap of 4 mm. The surgeon uses a bone graft that reduces the gap by 1.5 mm. Assuming a bone regeneration rate of 0.5 mm per week for the remaining gap, and knowing that bone remodeling requires woven bone to be replaced by lamellar bone at a rate of 0.1 mm per week (meaning the newly regenerated bone is initially woven and needs remodeling), how many weeks will it take for the *lamellar bone front* to completely bridge the *original* fracture gap (ignoring any graft remodeling)?
BIO_06062025_4;A study evaluates the inflammatory response following MMF versus RIF for mandibular fractures, measuring CRP.  The MMF group has an average CRP level of 15 mg/L, and the RIF group has 8 mg/L at 24 hours. CRP has a half-life of approximately 19 hours.  Assuming first-order kinetics decay, calculate the CRP level in the MMF group 48 hours *after* the initial 24-hour measurement.
BIO_06062025_5;A surgeon evaluates two MMF techniques: stainless steel wires and composite resin splints. The wires provide 50 N over 0.0002 m², and the splints provide 75 N over 0.0003 m².  The fracture site's cross-sectional area is 0.0005 m². Bone's compressive strength is 170 MPa.  Calculate the difference in pressure exerted by the two techniques (as before). Then, *assuming* the *lower* pressure is the baseline, what *additional force* distributed evenly over the entire fracture site would be required to exceed 75% of the bone's compressive strength? Express the additional force in Newtons (N).

Among patients with gas-forming *E. coli*, 60% require immediate percutaneous drainage due to the extent of gas production and associated tissue damage.  How many of the 200 patients diagnosed with EPN would be expected to require immediate percutaneous drainage based on the prevalence of Class 2 EPN and gas-forming *E. coli*?
BIO_06062025_2;A hospital is evaluating the impact of minimally invasive management strategies on mortality rates in EPN patients. A retrospective study compared 150 patients who underwent open surgical nephrectomy with 250 patients who received minimally invasive interventions. The mortality rate in the surgical group was 32%, while the minimally invasive group exhibited a mortality rate of 18%.  Severe sepsis contributed to 40% of deaths in the surgical group, but only 15% of deaths in the minimally invasive group. How many deaths related to severe sepsis were *avoided* by using the minimally invasive approach in this cohort of 400 patients compared to if all patients had the open surgical nephrectomy?
BIO_06062025_3;A clinical trial enrolled 120 diabetic patients with EPN. After treatment, 65% showed complete resolution without nephrectomy. Among the patients requiring nephrectomy, 40% developed subsequent chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring dialysis within two years.

BIO_06062025_1;A researcher is conducting a prospective, single-blinded, controlled clinical study on patients undergoing mandibular microfracture (MMF) to treat temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders. 30 patients (age 25-40, equal gender distribution) are enrolled. Post-surgery, all patients receive identical pain medication and oral hygiene instructions. Patients are divided into two groups: Group A undergoes MMF with standard surgical protocols, while Group B undergoes MMF with an enhanced, minimally invasive technique hypothesized to reduce soft tissue injury. The average post-operative infection rate in Group A was 7%, and in Group B was 4.2%. The researcher hypothesizes that Group B's minimally invasive technique results in a reduction in soft tissue trauma.

Group 1 received standard pre-operative counseling. Group 2 received enhanced pre-operative counseling focused on managing expectations and relaxation techniques. The mean VAS score for Group 1 was 6.5 and the mean VAS score for Group 2 was 4.3. Assuming VAS scores are normally distributed and a single patient scores 5.4 on VAS, what is the probability that the patient belongs to Group 1? Assume equal prior probabilities of belonging to either group and a standard deviation of VAS scores of 1.8 for both groups. Give the answer as a decimal value between 0 and 1.

Intraoperative data reveals that the average duration of surgery for Technique A is 90 minutes, while for Technique B it's 75 minutes. Postoperative data collected over 12 months shows that 8 patients in the Technique A group developed a minor infection, while only 3 patients in the Technique B group did. If the likelihood of infection is directly proportional to the square root of the surgery duration, what is the ratio of the actual infection rate of Technique B to the expected infection rate given its shorter surgical duration, rounded to two decimal places?

The number of patients who followed the instructions from Group A is 22, while those who followed the instructions from Group B is 18. Assuming, for each group, a direct proportionality between their observed rate of instruction following and the inverse of their infection rate, what is the difference of infection rate (Group A - Group B) between the two groups, assuming that everyone follows all instructions?
BIO_06062025_5;Researchers performed MMF on 40 patients experiencing TMJ dysfunction. They categorized the patients into two groups of 20: one group (A) with no pre-existing conditions, and another group (B) with a history of smoking. All patients underwent the same MMF procedure and received identical postoperative care. Analysis revealed that 3 patients from group A experienced a Grade 1 soft tissue injury, while 8 patients from group B experienced a Grade 1 soft tissue injury.

After several weeks of Nordic Walking, their pain decreases, and their muscle strength improves, leading to a 30% increase in step length. Simultaneously, their cadence (steps per minute) increases from 90 steps/minute to 100 steps/minute. Given that walking speed (m/min) is the product of step length (m) and cadence (steps/min), what is the percentage increase in walking speed after the Nordic Walking intervention?

Assume k is such that R=1 at baseline.
BIO_06062025_4;Researchers are studying the effect of Nordic Walking on bone density in postmenopausal women. A participant's baseline bone mineral density (BMD) in the hip is 0.8 g/cm². After a 6-month Nordic Walking program, BMD increases by 5%.  It is known that the risk of hip fracture is exponentially related to BMD, such that Risk = exp(-5 * BMD). By what percentage does the *relative* risk of hip fracture decrease (compared to baseline) after the intervention? This requires calculating the risk before and after the intervention and then calculating the percentage *decrease* in risk.
BIO_06062025_5;A physical therapist is using Nordic Walking to improve balance in a patient with peripheral neuropathy. Before the intervention, the patient's center of pressure (COP) sway area during a single-leg stance was 10 cm². After the intervention, the COP sway area decreased by 40%.  Assume that COP sway area (S) is related to the probability of a loss of balance (P) by the equation P = 0.1 * S + 0.05.

BIO_06062025_1;A geriatric rehabilitation specialist is investigating the effects of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) during Nordic Walking (NW) exercises on improving gait in older adults.  Baseline arm swing was quantified using Kinovea motion capture software, revealing a mean angle of $\\theta = 15^{\circ}$.  After a six-week RAS+NW intervention, the arm swing angle improved, following a logarithmic progression modeled as $\\theta_{new} = \\theta_{old} + A \\cdot ln(t+1)$, where $A = 5^{\circ}$ represents the therapy's effectiveness coefficient and $t$ is the number of weeks of therapy.

Using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, a patient initially required $t_1 = 15 \\,\\mathrm{seconds}$ to complete the task without RAS. With RAS, the same patient's TUG completion time decreased to $t_2 = 12 \\,\\mathrm{seconds}$. Assuming the TUG test covers a fixed distance ($d$), calculate the percentage increase in the patient's average speed ($v$) during the TUG test when using RAS, compared to the unassisted trial.
BIO_06062025_3;Researchers are studying the impact of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) on rehabilitating gait function in stroke survivors, using the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) as a primary outcome measure.  Prior to RAS therapy, a patient scored $FGA_1 = 20$ (out of 30), indicating significant impairments in balance and coordination.  Following a 4-week RAS intervention, the patient's FGA score improved to $FGA_2 = 25$. The FGA score is modeled as a function of gait speed ($v$) and balance ($b$) according to the equation $FGA = c \\cdot v^2 \\cdot \\sqrt{b}$, where $c$ is a proportionality constant.

In a prospective, single-blinded clinical study, 20 patients receive MMF screws and 20 receive Erich's arch bars. Post-operative infection rates are recorded. 3 patients in the MMF screw group and 7 in the Erich's arch bar group develop infections.  Considering the proximity of the oral microbiome to the fracture site, and the different surface materials of MMF screws (typically titanium) and Erich's arch bars (typically stainless steel), which material is more likely to be a preferential site for biofilm formation by *Streptococcus mutans*, and propose *one* biological mechanism that explains the difference in observed infection rates based on this factor.  What percentage of all patients in the study did NOT develop an infection?
BIO_06062025_2;A surgeon is deciding between using Erich's arch bars and MMF screws for a patient with a displaced mandibular fracture. Erich's arch bars are estimated to result in a 10-day healing time with a 2% risk of osteomyelitis. MMF screws are estimated to result in a 7-day healing time with a 5% risk of osteomyelitis. Assuming osteomyelitis prolongs overall healing time by 14 days, what is the expected (average) healing time in days for MMF Screws, considering the risk of osteomyelitis?
BIO_06062025_3;A clinical trial is conducted to assess patient discomfort following mandibular fracture repair using either hybrid arch bars or MMF screws. Pain levels are assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 10. The mean VAS score for patients treated with hybrid arch bars is 3.2 ($n=30$), and the standard deviation is 1.5. The mean VAS score for patients treated with MMF screws is 4.8 ($n=30$), and the standard deviation is 2.0. Calculate the standard error of the difference between the means of the two treatment methods. Considering that the VAS scores are subjective, and pain perception can be influenced by the release of endogenous opioid peptides, how could the genetic variability in opioid receptor genes contribute to the observed standard deviations in pain scores within each treatment group?
BIO_06062025_4;Following mandibular fracture repair, a patient exhibits signs of poor oral hygiene and a genetic predisposition to slower wound healing. The surgeon estimates the baseline risk of infection is 5%. Poor oral hygiene increases this risk by a factor of 3, and the genetic predisposition increases the risk by an additional 2 percentage points. Given that impaired angiogenesis is a characteristic of slower wound healing, explain how decreased vascularization at the fracture site could lead to an elevated risk of infection, and what is the patient's new estimated risk of infection (expressed as a percentage)?
BIO_06062025_5;A surgeon is using MMF to realign a fractured mandible. The initial displacement of the fracture is 8 mm. The MMF application is estimated to reduce the displacement by 75% in the first week. Bone remodeling is occurring at a rate of 0.2 mm per day to further reduce the displacement.  Considering that osteoblasts are responsible for new bone formation during remodeling, and their activity is influenced by growth factors such as BMP-2, how would a localized deficiency in BMP-2 production affect the rate of bone remodeling?  Assuming the remodeling rate is 0.2mm/day if BMP-2 is functioning optimally, but is reduced by 25% with BMP-2 deficiency, how many days after the first week will it take for the remaining displacement to be reduced to 0 mm?
BIO_06062025_1;A researcher is performing immunohistochemistry (IHC) on a series of endometrial tissue samples. They observe that a region in a proliferative phase sample displays strong PAX2 staining, with an average staining intensity score of 3 (on a scale of 0-3, with 0 being no staining and 3 being strong staining). In a subsequent endometrioid adenocarcinoma sample from the same patient, a similar region shows a significantly reduced PAX2 staining intensity, scoring an average of 0.5. Assuming the IHC staining intensity is directly proportional to the PAX2 protein concentration, and the PAX2 protein concentration in the proliferative phase is 1.5 $\\mu$g/cell, what is the estimated PAX2 protein concentration per cell in the endometrioid adenocarcinoma sample, in $\\mu$g/cell?
BIO_06062025_2;A pathologist is analyzing PAX2 expression in a cohort of 500 endometrial cancer samples using IHC.

After 2 hours, the glucose concentration decreases to $6 \, \mathrm{mM}$. If the cells consume glucose at a constant rate, what is the per cell glucose consumption rate in a 1 mL culture volume, given that there are $1 \times 10^6$ cells/mL in the culture? Express your answer in units of $\mathrm{pmol\,cell^{-1}\,h^{-1}}$.
BIO_06062025_4;Two linked genes, A and B, are located on the same chromosome. The recombination frequency between these genes is 8%. An individual with the genotype $Ab/aB$ is testcrossed with an individual with the genotype $ab/ab$.

How many additional patients became adherent as a result of the intervention, based on MEMS data?
BIO_06062025_1;An anesthesiologist is preparing for an Awake Fiberoptic Intubation (AFOI) on a patient with a history of difficult intubation. The anesthesiologist aims to achieve a Ramsay Sedation Score (RSS) of 3 prior to the procedure. They administer dexmedetomidine, an $\alpha_2$ adrenergic agonist. Based on pharmacokinetic studies, the drug has a linear relationship between infusion rate and plasma concentration. A plasma concentration of 0.4 $\text{ng/mL}$ is known to reliably produce an RSS of 3. The patient has a volume of distribution ($V_d$) of 70 L and the drug's clearance ($CL$) is 40 L/hr. Calculate the required infusion rate in $\mu\text{g/min}$ to maintain a plasma concentration of 0.4 $\text{ng/mL}$, assuming steady state is achieved.
BIO_06062025_2;During an AFOI procedure on a patient with severe COPD, despite adequate sedation, the patient's oxygen saturation ($SpO_2$) drops from 96% to 88% due to increased airway resistance and decreased ventilation. The patient's baseline partial pressure of arterial oxygen ($PaO_2$) was 60 $\text{mmHg}$. For the *purposes of this simplified calculation*, assume a linear relationship between $PaO_2$ and $SpO_2$ where 100% $SpO_2$ corresponds to 100 $\text{mmHg}$ $PaO_2$. Calculate the approximate drop in $PaO_2$ (in $\text{mmHg}$) that corresponds to the observed $SpO_2$ decrease.
BIO_06062025_3;In a clinical trial evaluating a novel sedative for AFOI, researchers are using the Ramsay Sedation Score (RSS) as a primary outcome measure. They observe that patients receiving the novel drug have a mean RSS of 2.5 with a standard deviation of 0.8 at the time of intubation. The control group, receiving standard sedation, has a mean RSS of 3.0 with a standard deviation of 0.7. The trial involves 50 patients in each group.

BIO_06062025_4;An anesthesiologist is performing AFOI on a patient with a known hypersensitivity to propofol. The chosen alternative is dexmedetomidine, targeting an RSS of 2. Dexmedetomidine is supplied as a solution of 100 $\mu\text{g/mL}$. The patient weighs 75 kg, and a loading dose of 1 $\mu\text{g/kg}$ is administered over 10 minutes, followed by a maintenance infusion.

BIO_06062025_5;A research team is conducting a clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of two different AFOI techniques (Technique A and Technique B) in minimizing airway reflex responses. They are using a composite score that incorporates coughing, gagging, and laryngospasm, with a higher score indicating more intense reflex responses. In Technique A (n=40), the mean composite score is 3.2 with a standard error of 0.5. In Technique B (n=40), the mean composite score is 2.5 with a standard error of 0.4. Calculate the estimated difference in the means, $\Delta$, plus the combined standard error of the means, $SE_c$ i.e. report $\Delta + SE_c$.
BIO_06062025_1;A clinical trial investigates a novel inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) combination for asthma management. Patient A, with an initial FEV1 of 2.5 L, is prescribed this combination. Research indicates that the ICS reduces airway inflammation, leading to improved lung function and reduced airway obstruction, as reflected in improved FEV1. Studies also show a correlation between reduction in inflammatory cytokine levels and FEV1 improvement: a 10% reduction in IL-5 and TNF-α corresponds to approximately 0.1 L increase in FEV1. If, after 3 months of treatment, Patient A experiences a 30% reduction in IL-5 and TNF-α levels, and accounting for the LABA's direct bronchodilatory effect contributing a fixed 0.15 L increase in FEV1 independently of inflammation, what is their predicted FEV1 (in liters) after these 3 months, rounded to one decimal place?
BIO_06062025_2;A study examines the effectiveness of metformin in managing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Two groups are compared: a control group receiving standard dietary advice and an intervention group receiving metformin in addition to the same dietary advice. At baseline, both groups have an average fasting blood glucose level of 7.8 mmol/L and an average HbA1c of 7.0%. After 6 months, the control group's fasting blood glucose remains at 7.8 mmol/L, while the intervention group's fasting blood glucose decreases by 20%. Metformin's primary mechanism involves reducing hepatic glucose production and improving insulin sensitivity. Considering that each 1% reduction in HbA1c translates to an approximate 1.5 mmol/L reduction in average fasting blood glucose, what would be the *predicted* HbA1c level (in percentage) of a patient in the intervention group after 6 months, rounded to one decimal place, based *solely* on the fasting blood glucose change observed in the intervention group and the given relationship between HbA1c and fasting blood glucose? Assume a linear relationship and that the initial relationship between HbA1c and glucose holds for this patient.
BIO_06062025_3;Researchers are assessing the effectiveness of an educational program on antibiotic stewardship in a hospital setting. Before the program, 60 out of 200 patients admitted with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) received broad-spectrum antibiotics unnecessarily (i.e., when narrower-spectrum antibiotics would have been equally effective). After the program, the *number* of patients receiving unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotics decreased by 50%. If each unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotic prescription increases the risk of *C. difficile* infection by 0.05 (risk is dimensionless) per patient, how much has the overall risk of *C. difficile* infection (dimensionless) been reduced across all 200 patients because of the decrease in inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions?
BIO_06062025_4;A research team investigates the impact of exercise on reducing insulin resistance in patients with metabolic syndrome. Before the intervention (a structured exercise program), the average HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) score for the participants was 4.0 (dimensionless). After 12 weeks of the exercise program, the HOMA-IR score decreased by 25%. Given that a HOMA-IR score above 2.5 indicates insulin resistance, and that improvements in insulin sensitivity are linked to increased glucose uptake by skeletal muscle cells, calculate the percentage increase in glucose uptake (dimensionless) *in these patients* if for every 0.5 point decrease in HOMA-IR score, glucose uptake increases by 8%.
BIO_06062025_5;A study evaluates the effectiveness of a new drug designed to inhibit the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction in cancer immunotherapy. Baseline tumor size is measured in cm3. A patient's initial tumor volume is 80 cm3. The drug is expected to stimulate T cell activity, leading to tumor regression. Studies show that for every 1 unit increase in the number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) per mm2, the tumor volume decreases by 2 cm3. After 4 weeks of treatment, the patient's TIL count increases by 15 TILs/mm2. However, the tumor cells also exhibit an increased expression of PD-L1, reducing the drug's effectiveness. This PD-L1 upregulation counteracts the effect of the increased TILs, reducing the tumor volume reduction by 10%. What is the patient's predicted tumor volume (in cm3) after 4 weeks, accounting for both the increase in TILs and the counteracting effect of PD-L1 upregulation? Note: While cm3 and TILs/mm2 are not strict SI units, they are conventional units used in clinical and biological research and are acceptable for this question's context.
BIO_06062025_1;A pathologist is analyzing endometrial tissue samples using immunohistochemistry to assess PAX2 expression. 100 cells are counted in each sample, and PAX2 staining intensity is graded on a scale of 0 (no staining) to 3 (strong staining). A normal proliferative endometrium sample shows an average PAX2 staining intensity of 2.8 per cell. An endometrial hyperplasia sample from the same patient shows an average PAX2 staining intensity of 1.4 per cell. If a subsequent endometrioid adenocarcinoma sample from the same patient shows a total PAX2 staining intensity score of 5 per 100 cells, what is the ratio of the average PAX2 staining intensity in the adenocarcinoma sample to that of the hyperplasia sample?
BIO_06062025_2;In normal endometrial tissue, an average of 85% of cells stain positive for PAX2. In endometrial carcinoma tissue, only 5% of cells stain positive for PAX2.

BIO_06062025_3;Researchers are investigating the relationship between PAX2 expression and disease stage in endometrioid adenocarcinoma. They use immunohistochemistry to quantify PAX2 staining intensity in tumor samples from 30 patients. PAX2 staining intensity is scored on a scale of 0 to 3, with 0 representing no staining and 3 representing strong staining. The average PAX2 staining intensity score for Stage I tumors is 1.8. If the average PAX2 staining intensity score decreases by 50% from Stage I to Stage III, what is the average PAX2 staining intensity score for Stage III tumors?
BIO_06062025_4;A research lab is analyzing PAX2 expression in endometrial biopsies using immunohistochemistry. They are using a semi-quantitative scoring system where the percentage of cells staining positive for PAX2 is multiplied by the average staining intensity (0-3). A normal endometrial sample shows 90% of cells staining positive with an average intensity of 2. An endometrial hyperplasia sample shows 50% of cells staining positive with an average intensity of 1. If an endometrial carcinoma sample shows 10% of cells staining positive, and the research team determines the semi-quantitative score must be less than or equal to 0.3 to diagnose the sample as a carcinoma, what is the maximum average staining intensity possible in this scoring system for a diagnosis of carcinoma?
BIO_06062025_1;A physical therapist is using Kinovea software to analyze the gait of a patient with Parkinson's disease. During a 10-meter walk, the patient's right arm swing amplitude is consistently measured at $15^\circ$, while normative data for healthy individuals of the same age and height indicates an average arm swing amplitude of $30^\circ$.  Parkinson's disease is known to affect dopamine production, which impacts motor control. Assuming that reduced arm swing is directly proportional to reduced dopamine signaling in the basal ganglia, and that restoring dopamine signaling pharmacologically can improve arm swing by a maximum of 50%, what would be the *predicted* arm swing amplitude (in degrees) *after* optimal pharmacological intervention, assuming the intervention is successful in maximizing dopamine signaling and therefore arm swing?
BIO_06062025_2;A researcher is evaluating the effectiveness of Nordic walking poles on improving balance in elderly individuals. A group of participants is assessed using the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) before and after a 6-week Nordic walking program. The average FGA score at baseline is 20. After the intervention, the average FGA score increases to 22.  A clinically significant improvement in FGA score is associated with a reduction in fall risk. Assuming a linear relationship between FGA score and fall risk reduction such that each 1-point increase in FGA score reduces fall risk by 5%, but also knowing that fall risk cannot be reduced below zero, what is the percentage reduction in fall risk achieved by the intervention for this group?
BIO_06062025_3;A neurologist is monitoring a patient with Parkinson's disease using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. At the initial assessment, the patient completes the TUG in 15 seconds. After implementing a gait and balance rehabilitation program including treadmill training and balance exercises, the patient's TUG time decreases to 12 seconds. Treadmill training is known to improve mitochondrial function in muscle cells, leading to increased ATP production and improved muscle power. Assuming the decrease in TUG time is directly proportional to the percentage increase in muscle power, and that a healthy individual completes the TUG in 10 seconds, what percentage *increase* in muscle power would the patient need to achieve *relative to their post-rehabilitation power output* to reach the healthy individual's TUG time, assuming this increase is achievable?
BIO_06062025_4;A patient with a history of falls is undergoing gait analysis. It is determined that their gait speed is 0.8 m/s. The therapist prescribes a Nordic walking intervention aimed at increasing gait speed.  Increased gait speed is associated with improved activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), a brain region crucial for executive function and motor planning. If research suggests that optimal dlPFC activation requires a gait speed of at least 1.2 m/s for this patient's age group, and that the patient's dlPFC activation is linearly proportional to their gait speed relative to this optimal value, what is the *percentage* of optimal dlPFC activation achieved by the patient at their initial gait speed of 0.8 m/s? Express your answer as a percentage of the *optimal* 1.2 m/s.
BIO_06062025_5;A rehabilitation center is evaluating the effect of a new balance training program on patients with Parkinson’s disease. Patients are assessed for their arm swing during a standard walking test. Before the program, the average arm swing is recorded as $10^\circ$. After 8 weeks of training, the average arm swing increases to $16^\circ$. It is known that balance training can improve proprioception by increasing the sensitivity of muscle spindles. Assuming that the increase in arm swing is directly proportional to the improvement in proprioceptive accuracy, and that healthy individuals have an arm swing of $32^\circ$, what is the percentage *increase* in muscle spindle sensitivity (relative to their *post*-intervention sensitivity) that the patients would need to achieve to reach the arm swing amplitude of healthy individuals, *assuming this further increase is proportional to further improvement in muscle spindle sensitivity*?
BIO_06062025_1;A rural hospital, dependent on a local spring for its water supply, faces a cryptosporidium outbreak following heavy rainfall and agricultural runoff. Before the contamination, the spring supported a stable population of Daphnia magna, a filter-feeding crustacean, with a carrying capacity, $K = 8.0 \times 10^4$ individuals/L. After the outbreak, the spring's ability to support Daphnia is reduced due to increased turbidity and decreased food quality, resulting in a lower carrying capacity of $K = 3.0 \times 10^4$ individuals/L.  The cryptosporidium also directly affects the Daphnia, reducing their per capita birth rate.  If the Daphnia population's intrinsic rate of increase, $r$, was initially $0.8$ day$^{-1}$, and this is now reduced to $0.3$ day$^{-1}$ due to the parasite, and the initial Daphnia population density, $N_0$, immediately after the rainfall is $2.0 \times 10^4$ individuals/L, calculate the Daphnia population density (individuals/L) predicted by the logistic growth model three days later, assuming continuous growth. Report your answer to the nearest whole number.
BIO_06062025_2;A hospital is treating patients exposed to a novel nerve agent. The primary treatment involves administering atropine, a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine receptors. The effective dose of atropine required to achieve 50% receptor occupancy is 2 mg (represented as the $EC_{50}$). A patient presents with severe symptoms requiring 80% receptor occupancy for therapeutic effect. Assuming a standard competitive binding model, calculate the atropine dose (in mg) needed to achieve the required 80% receptor occupancy. Report your answer to one decimal place.
BIO_06062025_3;During a mass casualty event, a hospital must prioritize patients needing blood transfusions. The hospital has 10 units of Type O negative (O-) blood available. Based on current patient data, the predicted blood usage rate is as follows: 3 units will be used per hour due to immediate trauma cases and an additional usage rate of 0.5 unit will be used per hour for patients with ongoing internal bleeding. If the event is predicted to last for 6 hours, and after 6 hours additional O- blood arrives at the hospital, will the hospital run out of O- blood before additional blood is available? Respond either yes or no.
BIO_06062025_4;A hospital needs to prepare a buffer solution for maintaining the pH of cell cultures. They require 1.5 L of a 0.2 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.2. They have access to stock solutions of 1 M $KH_2PO_4$ (monobasic) and 1 M $K_2HPO_4$ (dibasic). The $pK_a$ of the relevant phosphate equilibrium is 7.2. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, calculate the volume (in mL) of the 1 M $K_2HPO_4$ solution needed to prepare the required buffer. Report your answer to the nearest whole number.
BIO_06062025_5;A hospital's HVAC system is compromised during a heatwave, affecting the temperature regulation of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Premature infants in the NICU have a surface area to mass ratio of approximately $0.06 \ m^2/g$ and a metabolic rate of $200 \ J/kg/day$. The average mass of an infant in the NICU is 1 kg. If the room temperature increases by 5°C, increasing the rate of heat loss to the environment through radiation by $12 \ W/m^2$ (watts per square meter) due to increased radiation, will the infant’s metabolic rate be sufficient to counter heat loss if the excess radiative heatloss is the only consideration? Respond either yes or no.
