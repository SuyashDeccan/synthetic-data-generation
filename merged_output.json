A closed wire loop, made of S, does not\nallow any change in flux through itself by inducing a suitable current to generate a compensating flux.\nThe induced current in the loop cannot decay due to its zero resistance. This current gives rise to a\nmagnetic moment which in turn repels the source of magnetic field or flux. Consider such a loop, of\nradius a, with its centre at the origin. A magnetic dipole of moment m is brought along the axis of this\nloop from infinity to a point at distance r(>> a) from the centre of the loop with its north pole always\nfacing the loop, as shown in the figure below.\nμ 0 m\nThe magnitude of magnetic field of a dipole m, at a point on its axis at distance r, is        3  , where 0 is\n2π r\nthe permeability of free space.
